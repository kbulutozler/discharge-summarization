IMAGING:

ECG on admission: Sinus bradycardia. Tiny inferior Q waves could 
represent recent or prior inferior myocardial infarction. Right 
ventricular conduction delay not meeting full criteria for right 
bundle-branch block. J point elevation in the lateral leads. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the findings are 
similar. 

Cardiac catheterization ___ preliminary: 
COMMENTS:      
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 

demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary 
artery 
disease.  The LMCA was a very short vessel with no 
angiographically 
apparent diseas.  The LAD and LCx were both large caliber 
vessels with 
no angiographically apparent disease.  The RCA had minimal 
luminal 
irregularities. 
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided 
filling 
pressures with an LVEDP of 27 mmHg.  There was no aortic 
stenosis noted 
on pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta. 
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a normal ejection fraction 
with no 
wall motion abnormalities.  There was no mitral regurgitation. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery 
disease. 
2. Normal ventricular function. 
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressure. 
4. No aortic stenosis. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
change.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male who presented to ___ for acute 
chest pain at rest, was transferred for code STEMI with mild ST 
elevations in inferior leads and T wave inversions in 
anterolateral leads, and was found to have positive cardiac 
biomarkers and mild luminal irregularities in the coronaries on 
catheterization.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Chest pain/elevated troponin: Unclear etiology of pain, but 
unlikely to be coronary artery disease given that patient denies 
angina symptoms, only cardiovascular risk factor is remote 
tobacco use, and there is no evidence of coronary artery disease 
on catheterization. It is possible that polycythemia ___ could 
have precipitated thrombosis in a distal branch not noted on 
catheterization.  Vasospasm is also a possibility, but there is 
no report of cocaine abuse.  Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy was 
considered unlikely given normal left ventriculogram, and 
unlikely to be myocarditis given patient does not have symptoms 
of congestive heart failure and URI symptoms only started 2 days 
ago with a normal echocardiogram.  Another possibility could be 
pulmonary embolus as patient did have hypoxia on presentation, 
however patient was not tachycardic, Wells score was 0 and 
D-dimer was normal.  Cardiac biomarkers were trended, showing 
elevations in troponin and CK-MB, which were trending down at 
the time of discharge.  Patient was started on aspirin 325 mg 
daily and metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.  Cardiac MR was 
ordered for outpatient workup to further delineate a cause of 
the patient symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.  He was chest 
pain free at the time of discharge.  Close follow-up was 
arranged with a cardiologist, as well as the patient's PCP.  
  
# Pump function: patient appeared euvolemic on exam, with no 
prior history of heart disease.  Echocardiogram revealed no 
abnormalities in heart function.  
.  
# Heart rhythm: Patient was in normal sinus rhythm with 8 beats 
of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight that was 
asymptomatic.  

# Polycythemia ___: patient is currently getting phlebotomy 
every 2 weeks.  He was arranged for outpatient hematology 
follow-up upon discharge.
  
TRANSITION OF CARE
------------------  
Code status: patient is confirmed full code  

Follow-up: patient will require a cardiac MR upon discharge, and 
is scheduled up for follow-up with cardiology.  His cholesterol 
panel returned after discharge and should be followed up by the 
outpatient cardiologist.   He will require follow-up with his 
outpatient hematologist for his polycythemia ___.  He also has 
scheduled follow-up with his PCP.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___.  You came for 
further evaluation of chest pain.  Cardiac catheterization 
showed some mild abnormalities of the heart's blood vessels.  
You will require a cardiac MRI as an outpatient to further 
evaluate this abnormality.  It is important that you continue to 
take your medications as indicated and follow up with the 
appointments listed below.  Please be sure to limit exertional 
activity for the next month.

The following changes have been made to your medications:

We ADDED metoprolol succinate, based on the abnormalities found 
due to your chest pain representing cardiac injury.  If you 
experience lightheadedness or dizziness on this medication, 
please call your doctor and stop taking it until told otherwise.
We ADDED aspirin, full-dose, based on the abnormalities found 
due to your chest pain.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo F with a history of triple negative BRCA1+ 
breast cancer diagnosed in ___. She underwent bilateral 
mastectomy and chemotherapy at that time. She has been generally 
lost to follow-up but was hospitalized recently for shortness of 
breath and found to have recurrence of her cancer.  
 Body imaging showed extensive probable metastases in the thorax 
with adenopathy and numerous pulmonary nodules as well as some 
left lung segment collapse. She did not have large pleural or 
pericardial effusions. The abdomen was benign including the 
liver. Bone scan, however, showed numerous abnormalities 
suggesting skeletal metastases. Widespread skeletal involvement 
is somewhat uncommon in triple-negative cancers, but the bone 
scan compared to prior scans does show a marked change. Her 
tumor marker is mildly elevated. She has some hoarseness, which 
likely reflects left recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement given 
the high concentration of disease in her left upper chest.  

 She now comes in because reports that she has had a severe 
headache and nausea for the past 48 hours. She reports that she 
has been waking up with a headaches every morning this week; 
however, this headache has persisted since yesterday and has not 
resolved. She reports she has been feeling nauseous and has not 
been able to each much. Reports that today she ""vomited up 
bile."" She denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope. 
Reports that she has had difficulty seeing out of her L eye and 
""can only see half a word"" when she reads.  

 In the ED, she had a head CT that showed:  
 There are multiple intracranial metastatic lesions. A lesion in 
the right occipital lobe best seen on series 602 B image 31 
measures approximately 3.1 x 3.1 cm and is complicated by a 
small amount of intralesional hemorrhage. There is associated 
vasogenic edema. Additional lesions are seen, for example and 
extra-axial lesion on series 2, image 23 abutting the inner 
table of the frontal bone in a left para falcine location. A 
small hyperdense lesion at the left parietal vertex is seen on 
series 2, image 25. A lesion abutting the  
 frontal lobe is seen on series 2, image 13 measuring 
approximately 1.4 x 3.7 cm. There is no midline shift or 
downward herniation though there is asymmetric effacement of 
right cerebral sulci compared to the left.  
 She was evaluated by neurosurgery who recommended Keppra, 
Dexamethasone, keeping SBP<140, and MRI scan.  
 
 On arrival to the floor, patient is tired, but otherwise well 
appearing.  
 REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 10 point ROS was performed and was 
otherwise negative.  
 
Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY  
She initially presented in early ___ with a multicentric 
high-grade triple-negative left breast cancer. The largest focus 
of invasive cancer was 5 cm. There was no lymphovascular 
invasion and her four sentinel lymph nodes sampled at the time 
of mastectomy in ___ were negative. The contralateral 
prophylactic right mastectomy was negative pathologically.  
 BRCA testing showed a BRCA1 mutation.  
 Thus, she had an advanced left breast cancer which was 
multifocal but no lymph node spread while the right breast was 
negative. Following recovery from her mastectomy and her 
bilateral ___ flap reconstructions, a port was inserted and she 
began dose-dense cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in early ___. She received four doses of dose-dense cyclophosphamide and 
doxorubicin followed by weekly paclitaxel. Dr. ___ was 
consulted, but did not feel that she required post mastectomy 
radiation therapy based on free margins, the absence of 
lymphovascular invasion and the absence of nodal involvement.  
 Following her chemotherapy there was no additional systemic 
therapy given because of her triple-negative status. We did 
strongly encourage her to have a prophylactic bilateral BSO, but 
she opted to defer that following completion of her other 
therapy. In fact, this was never done and she had a long 
interval where she did not ___ for routine followup here.  
 She was recently seen for shortness of breath. Re-staging 
showed recurrent disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for 
shortness of breath and headache. Unfortunately, a CT scan of 
your head showed that you had cancer that spread to your brain. 
An MRI also showed spread of your cancer to the brain. 
Radiation-Oncology, Neurosurgery, and Neuro-Oncology all 
evaluated you in the hospital. A lumbar puncture (LP) was 
performed to determine if there was any cancer in the fluid 
around your brain. Currently we are planning for your radiation 
as an outpatient and it is very important that you follow-up 
with Radiation-Oncology and Neuro-Oncology.

We started you on a medication called dexamethasone which helps 
with swelling and can treat nausea. Please continue to take this 
twice per day as prescribed. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you,
Your ___ Team
 
Followup Instructions:

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended ensure supplementation, 
but pt. did not like ensure and made this clear to nutrition, 
ensure was seen unopened on pt.s tray every morning.
.
#Diarrhea: Likely ___ OI, differential is quite wide: crypto, 
giardia, ___, CMV, C. diff. All previous wkup 
was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

IMAGING
=================
pMIBI ___
FINDINGS:  
  
Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged at 158ml end-diastolic 
volume (normal to 110ml).   
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a partially reversible 
inferolateral perfusion defect.  Gated images reveal 
hypokinesis, particularly in the inferior territory.  
  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 40%. 
  No prior study for comparison. 
  
IMPRESSION:  1) Partially reversible inferolateral perfusion 
defect. 
  2) Dilated LV end-diastolic volume. 
  3) Decreased LV ejection fraction of 40%. 

___ CT ABD/PELVIS
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Near complete resolution of previously demonstrated residual 
rectal wall
thickening. Focal sacculations just proximal to an area of 
stricture in the
proximal rectum relate to pseudo-diverticula/sacculations, 
largest measuring
up to 3 cm. No evidence of fistula formation on this 
examination.
2. Significant circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening 
may relate to
cystitis versus chronic outlet obstruction.
3. Mild to moderate hydronephrosis of the right pelvic 
transplant kidney,
likely accentuated due to distended bladder.

___ COLONOSCOPY
Diffuse ulcerations and structuring of distal sigmoid and 
proximal and mid rectum. 

___ UE US
IMPRESSION:
 
1. A central line is visualized in the right basilic vein with 
minimal
nonocclusive thrombus.
2. Occlusive thrombus in a superficial vein in the posterior 
forearm.
3. Cephalic vein is not visualized. Otherwise, no evidence of 
deep vein
thrombosis in the right upper extremity.

___ ABD/PELVIS
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Interval improvement of ischemic colitis. Persistent abnormal 
wall
thickening of the distal rectosigmoid colon with pericolonic 
edema and fat
stranding.   Previously noted rectosigmoid pneumatosis has 
resolved.
2. Large stool burden throughout the colon, substantially 
increased since 3
weeks before.
3. Persistent marked thickening of bladder wall.

___ RUQUS
1. Right lower quadrant transplant kidney with a normal Doppler 
indices and
unchanged moderate hydronephrosis.
2. Redemonstration of markedly thickened bladder wall.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M w/ ESRD s/p DCD renal transplant 
in ___ on cellcept/tacro, s/p MVC ___ yrs ago w/ chronic 
neurogenic bladder c/b recurrent UTIs, HTN, diabetes, and recent 
prolonged hospitalization for septic shock c/b ischemic colitis, 
presenting with abdominal pain. He underwent aggressive bowel 
regimen with large stool burden and had a colonoscopy concerning 
for ischemic colitis. He was seen by CRS with no recommended 
surgical intervention. Course was complicated by UTI with MDR 
e.coli, and he underwent pMIBI which did not identify any 
reversible perfusion defect per cardiology consultation team. He 
will follow up with CRS, cardiology, and transplant nephrology 
as an outpatient and is discharged to skilled nursing facility.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#. Abdominal Pain 
#. Hx of Ischemic/C.Diff Colitis
Patient with imaging initially significant for improving 
colitis, persistent proctocolitis, and large stool burden. 
Abdominal pain though to be most likely ___ to large stool 
burden, so was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen. CRS was 
consulted without acute surgical need. ID was consulted as he 
was scheduled to followup with them as outpatient, who d/c'd his 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl which he was on from his previous course. 
The patient was scheduled for outpatient flex sig, so GI was 
consulted to perform in house. His prep was successful and he 
underwent a full colonoscopy, which was significant for erosion, 
ulceration and strictures, concerning for ischemic colitis, 
along with ? of diverticuli or fistulas. He underwent a CT with 
rectal contrast with no signs of fistulas. He was again seen by 
CRS with no plan for surgical intervention. He was kept on 
standing bowel regimen. MMF dose was decreased due to initial 
concern for MMF colitis but due to low suspicion on colonoscopy 
findings for MMF toxicity this was increased to 500 bid from 
250.

#. ESRD s/p DCD Renal Transplant 
#. Neurogenic Bladder
Renal U/S fairly unremarkable. Creatinine peaked at 1.7 thought 
to be in the setting of pre-renal ___ from large volume diarrhea 
and improved with fluids. He was kept on MMF 250mg BID, tacro to 
1.5 BID,  Bactrim ppx, and home oxybutynin. His home lisinopril 
was held on discharge.

#. MDR E.coli CAUTI
>100,000 CFU of e.coli in UA noted when had leukocytosis. ID was 
consulted who recommended meropenem until ___. He will continue 
po vanc through ___ for c. diff prophylaxis. He was discharged 
on ___ 500 mg q6h. If necessary can switch to ertapenem 1g 
q24hrs per ID consult for dosing convenience.

#. H/o NSTEMI
During last hospitalization had suspicion for type II NSTEMI 
with ischemic bowel, with plan for outpatient cardiac cath. In 
the setting of potential surgical planning, cardiology was 
consulted, who recommended avoiding surgery unless urgently 
needed and to obtain pMIBI which was read as having partially 
reversible perfusion defect but cardiology consult team 
concluded there was no reversible defect. He was continued on 
ASA, rosuvastatin, metoprolol.

#. Acute on  Chronic Back Pain
Seen by chronic pain who recommended continuing home Vicodin 
7.5mg/325mg while in house.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
#. Afib
Currently appears in sinus rhythm. 
Continued Metoprolol for rate control while AC still held due to 
bleeding risk 

#. HTN
- Continued home amlodipine and held home lisinopril as above 

#. DMII
Continued home glargine 32 and standing Humalog 2 with meals

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] While at rehab, will need specific 14 ___ coude catheters, 
which can be obtained from outpatient ___ clinic if unable 
to bring from home

[] He should have labs in 1 week (___) to include tacrolimus 
levels, LFTs, BMP, and CBC.

[] He is discharged with a tacro level of 7.0 on 1 mg bid.

[] Discharged on meropenem 500 mg q6h; for convenience can 
switch to ertapenem 1g daily if preferred

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

You were here because you were having abdominal pain. You were 
seen by the gastrointestinal (GI) team and the colorectal team, 
who felt that you had a lot of extra stool that was causing the 
pain. You also had a colonoscopy, which showed ulcers and narrow 
areas of your colon. Fortunately, the colorectal surgery team 
did not think you needed surgery. You had a stress test which 
did not show any active areas of decrease blood flow to your 
heart, and the cardiology team concluded that you would not 
benefit from an invasive procedure to look at the vessels of 
your heart. You were also found to have a urinary tract 
infection, for which you are discharged on a course of 
antibiotics through your PICC which will continue through ___. 
You will continue oral vancomycin through ___ to prevent c. diff 
infection.

When you leave, it is important you take your medications as 
prescribed. It is also important you keep your appointments as 
listed below. You will follow-up with cardiology and colorectal 
surgery as an outpatient as well as transplant nephrology.

We wish you the best of luck!
