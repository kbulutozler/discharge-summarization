If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or 
Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin, prior to your surgery, you 
should not resume taking this until cleared by your doctor.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and 
Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding. 
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure 
you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, 
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach 
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with 
meals, or a glass of milk. 

ACTIVITY:
The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired 
or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger 
every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take 
to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself 
again. In general:
Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor 
and therapist.
Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you 
are feeling good.
You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing 
activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and 
begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
DO NOT DRIVE until you speak with your physician.
Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your 
physician.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and 
push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy 
objects, or straining at stool.
Do your breathing exercises every two hours.  
Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour,  that you 
are awake.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Respiratory failure - Patient was initially admitted to the 
hospital and required intubation in the setting of respiratory 
failure.  The patient had an aspiration pneumonia.  The patient 
was noted to be positive for influenza and it was likely in this 
setting that he vomited and aspirated causing the hypoxia noted 
at his nursing home.  He had a difficult course of extubation 
because of copious secretions.  A broncoscopy was performed 
which showed some significant tracheitis.  There was a concern 
for HSV infections.  He completed a course of steroids and 
acyclovir for this tracheitis.  He also completed a course of 
tamiflu and Vanc/Zosyn for his aspiration pneumonia.  All of 
these were completed by the time of discharge.  He was extubated 
and called out to the medicine floor on 3L NC.  His respiratory 
status continued to improve and his oxygen requirement decrease. 
 His oxygen will continue to be weaned at this long term care 
facility. 
.  
#Cardiovascular - Patient was briefly hypotensive in unit, 
requiring pressors in the setting of intubation.  His pressures 
stablized and at the time of call out, he was restarted on his 
midodrine.  His lasix was also resumed.  He does not appear 
volume overloaded.  
.  
#Parkinsons's Disease - Continued home dosing of meds  
.  
#Nutrition - Patient had some difficulty swallowing after his 
extubation. A NG tube was placed and he recieved tube feeds.  
Speech and swallow saw the patient and cleared the patient for a 
regular diet, now straws with 1:1 supervision and assistance as 
needed.  He can also take whole pills in some puree.  His 
nutritional status should be closely monitored at his long term 
care facility to ensure he is taking enough nutrition.
.
#Incidental Findings on CT:  Patient noted to have a right 
adrenal lesion.  The radiologists recommended a dedicated 
adrenal MRI or CT scan for further evaluation.  Probably 
tracheomalacia was also noted.  If needed, this could be further 
evaluated in the future with a dedicated CT of the trachea.  
These findings should be addressed and monitored by his primary 
care physician.
.
#GERD - continued PPI  
.  
Code Status - DNR but ok to intubate

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female who comes to see 
Dr.
___ for second opinion. She developed illness in ___ 
___ where abnormal CXR led to CT chest which was followed since
every six months revealing in ___ stable bilateral
parenchymal nodules. A persistent soft tissue density in left
posterobasal segment bronchus was seen, along with left thyroid
stable hypodense nodules. This prompted further workup with
bronchoscopy on ___ revealing a left posterior basal segment
nodular endobronchial lesion. This was positive for carcinoid.
LLL BAL was negative. The pateint refused early bronchoscopy in
___ due to ""nerves"". Also noted on bronch was a posterior
tracheal wall invagination or submucosal nodule, and stenosis of
the right middle lobe. 
She underwent further evaluation with PET CT ___ which was
negative for uptake. MR neck was done on ___ to further
identify the subcarinal lesion in trachea, which was not 
biopsied
during bronch due to concern for bleeding. The MR revealed no
upper tracheal mass below the right vocal cords. There appeared
to be slight asymmetry and fullness in the region of the right
palatine tonsil to the right of the uvula and soft palate of
unknown significance. Visual inspection was recommended. An
enhancing left thyroid lesion corresponds to the hypodense 
nodule
on CT chest ___. No further diagnostic workup was done on her
thyroid.

The patient suffers from anxiety which she reports gives her
cough, palpitations and GI complaints. Once she is calm she

Brief Hospital Course:
============================
BRIEF SUMMARY:
============================
Mr. ___ is a ___ hx HCV/EtOH cirrhosis (MELD-Na 22 on 
admission, c/b ascites, HE, parastomal variceal bleed s/p TIPS 
___, and ongoing alcohol use), mild AS, bladder/prostate 
cancer s/p cystectomy w/ileal conduit and L nephrostomy tube, hx 
MDR klebsiella and VRE UTI, recently E coli UTI, multiple 
previous instances of leaving AMA, who presented with 2 days of 
worsening abdominal pain and fever, found to have a positive UA, 
c/f pyelonephritis, as well as concerns for a GIB and transient 
thrombocytopenia.

============================
DETAILED SUMMARY BY PROBLEM: 
============================
# Pyelonephritis: Pt reported fevers to 102 at home, patient 
presented with grossly positive UTI as assessed by urinalysis, 
cultures demonstrating Escherichia coli consistent with prior 
culture and sensitivities obtained on ___.  Left-sided 
costovertebral angle tenderness on exam on initial presentation, 
therefore empiric coverage for pyelonephritis was initiated with 
meropenem and linezolid given history of prior MDR Klebsiella 
and VRE UTIs which were potentially less than optimally treated 
given patient's propensity to leave AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE on 
frequent occasions.  Patient was transitioned to zosyn and 
linezolid, the latter of which was discontinued after patient 
experienced a transient drop in platelet count. Patient became 
agitated and demanded removal of his IV access and attempted to 
leave AMA, after which a midline was placed ___. Patient 
repeated desire to leave AMA ___, despite clear warning that he 
had not completed the intended IV antibiotic course of 14 days, 
or received the intended PICC placement for completion of his 
course as an outpatient. Patient voiced clear understanding of 
the dangers involved with going home against medical advice. 
Patient did not demonstrate fever during this admission. 

#  Anemia: C/f GIB, given multiple previous admissions with 
anemia and capsule endoscopy from ___ showing bleeding papules 
in gastric antrum and small bowl angiodysplasia ___. Patient 
previously left AMA prior to any w/u. Presented demonstrating 
hematocrit drop without any known foci of bleeding, no reports 
of bright red blood per rectum or melena. Began to experience 
overt melena on ___. Underwent EGD on ___ which did not show 
evidence of bleed. Underwent capsule endoscopy on ___ but 
patient was not compliant with monitor and removed several times 
to shower. He ultimately left AMA with capsule endoscope still 
in system. Discussed with GI and okay for him to leave--he will 
pass capsule spontaneously. They will monitor electronically and 
contact him if not passed in several days. Hgb on discharge was 
7.1.

# Thrombocytopenia: Pt had known hx of HCV and cirrhosis. 
Experienced sudden onset drop ___ to 12k platelets. Patient had 
notably had several days of linezolid. Patient had also been 
experiencing ongoing melena and was receiving IV zosyn. Coags 
were normal, it was therefore thought there was low likelihood 
of DIC. Thrombocytopenia was thought to be ___ a consumptive 
process, though linezolid was discontinued and patient received 
platelet transfusion, after which count remained higher, albeit 
downtrending prior to discharge. Patient was advised regarding 
the danger of leaving the hospital with a downtrending plt 
count, though proceeded to leave AMA.

# HCV/EtOH cirrhosis: T Bili elevated to 2.0 on admission 
(previously normal), transaminases normal. Coags not ordered in 
ED. Pt likely not transplant candidate; active alcohol use. 
Lactulose was resumed following no witnessed bleeding and 
patient request. Once patient began experiencing overt melena 
___ was again discontinued and not resumed prior to discharge.

# ___: Pt w/Cr 1.6 on admission, previously ___ has been thought 
to be cardiorenal in nature as it responds to diuresis. FeUrea 
was 41.3% on admission implying intrinsic cause. Creatinine on 
admission is lower than it had been on previous 
hospitalizations.
Uptrending Cr over days after admission may reflect effect of 
holding Lasix. Intermittent lasix boluses were resumed. 
Creatinine on discharge was 2.7.
 
#  Alcohol use: Patient intoxicated to EtOH of 76 in ED. 
Reported having a ""few beers"".  patient was not kept on CIWA 
scale given possibility of decompensated liver disease.

*Chronic Issues
# HLD: Continued home atorvastatin w/o issue.
 
============================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
============================
- patient has not had follow-up with any primary care doctor 
apart from his urologist for follow-up regarding cystectomy 
(patient reports he will be seeing a Dr. ___ at ___). 
 He would benefit from continued outpatient care, which would 
help prevent further frequent admissions and AMA discharges from 
the hospital.
- Patient needs clear discussion of admission goals on future 
admissions. Please refer to AMA notes from ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to be involved with your care at ___ 
___.

You were admitted to the hospital after you had an episode of 
bright red blood from the rectum while you are at home as well 
as a worsening type of abdominal and back pain. You recently had 
a workup at ___ that revealed a likely 
cause of slow bleeding from your small intestine. We attempted 
to complete a workup of ongoing bleeding, which included a 
repeat scoping procedure as well as a capsule study. You 
unfortunately left the hospital against medical advice before 
this workup could be completed. We explained to you that it was 
dangerous for you to do so, but you voiced understanding of the 
risks and left anyway.

You presented with evidence of low blood counts, which could 
possibly be from a recent slow bleeding in your small intestine. 
You also had urine sample that suggested that you were infected, 
and you were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as 
pain medications for possible infection of the kidney. You left 
the hospital before you could be treated completely for this.

It will be very important for you to establish some form of 
primary care, which will help prevent frequent hospitalizations 
for your ongoing health conditions. It will also be important 
for you to establish goals for hospitalizations, as you 
routinely have left the hospital against the clear advice of 
medical professionals, always acknowledging the danger you are 
subjecting yourself to.

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an ___ year old Man with a history of metastatic 
prostate cancer to the T-spine presents with one day of painless 
hematuria. 
.
# Hematuria/UTI:  The patient had a positive UA on admission. CT 
of the Pelvis demonstrated hyperdense material in the bladder. 
The patient was started on Levaquin in the ED for UTI and was 
switched to ciprofloxacin.  A three way catheter for continuous 
bladder irrigation was placed.   The hematuria resolved over 
initial 24 hours of admission however, it returned within 
several hours of discontinuing the irrigation. Hematocrit was 
stable.  Urology was consulted and recommended resumption of 
continuous irrigation and lowering of the patient's home lovenox 
to once daily.  His hematuria subsequently resolved.  Cultures 
from admission eventually grew Proteus.  The patient was 
discharged on ciprofloxacin for a completion of a 10 day course. 

.  
# Pain/Difficulty Ambulating - The patient reported bilateral 
lower extremity pain and increased difficulty with ambulation 
requiring the use of a walker.  While his neurological exam was 
mostly unremarkable, an MRI of the spine demonstrated new 
epidural disease at L4 level with high-grade thecal sac 
compression and spinal stenosis.  The patient was started on 
dexamethasone and radiation oncology was consulted.  The patient 
underwent 1 round of spinal radiation for palliation of 
symptoms.  His symptoms improved and he demonstrated improved 
symptoms and walker-free ambulation.  He was discharged on a 
post radiation steroid taper.
.
# Altered mental status: During his hospitalization, the patient 
had mild confusion and agitation.  It was felt that this was 
consistent with either infectious or drug induced delirium, 
given the patients concurrent UTI and steroid use.  His symptoms 
resolved over 24 hours and he was alert and oriented at the time 
of discharge.  He was discharged home with ___ services.
.
# Prostate cancer: The patient underwent radiation as above.  In 
addition, per his outpatient oncologist the patient was 
discharged on high-dose Casodex at 150 mg daily.  He was 
scheduled for follow up with Dr. ___ on ___.  
.  
# Hypertension: The patient was noted to be moderately 
hypertensive (SBPs in 180s) despite his home antihypertensive 
regimen.  He was started on Metoprolol with modest improvement. 
The need for this medication or further adjustments in dose 
should continue to be monitored by his outpatient providers.
.  
# DVT: The patient had a history of DVT in ___.  On admission, 
he was taking 80mg BID.  Given his hematuria, this was lowered 
to 80mg once a day and the patient was instructed to continue 
this medication at this new dose.

IMAGING/CATHETERIZATION:
========================
___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
hypokinesis of the septum, ___ anterior walls, and true 
apex. The basal inferior wall is also hypokinetic. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular size. Mild to moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with 
coronary artery disease involving the left anterior descending 
artery. Mild aortic regurgitation. No pericardial effusion.

___ CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary angiography: right dominant
  LMCA: normal
  LAD: subtotal occlusion after proximal stents followed by long
segment of severe diffuse disease and then total occlusion at 
the
origin of the more distal stent(s). No distal collateral 
filling.
  LCX: focal eccentric ___ instent lesion in OM 1
  RCA: 60% focal lesion after PDA; otherwise minor disease

Interventional details
  Plan was to attempt to reperfuse LAD beyond prior stents to
assess size of distal vessel to determine whether further
intervention would be feasible. Changed for ___ Fr sheath and 
XBLAD
3.5 guide. All lesions were crossed with first a Prowater and
then a Pilot 50 wire into the distal vessel. All were dilated
with sequential inflations with 2.0 balloon with improvement in
the long mid segment but without distal flow. Distal contrast
injection showed short small distal vessel with 90% apical
lesion. This was dilated with the 2.0 balloon and ic NTG given
without change in the caliber of the distal vessel, It was then
clear that there would be no significant distal runoff with
further stenting and the procedure was terminated. Final distal
injection showed small localized perforation; however injection
from the guiding catheter showed persistent total occlusion of
the distal vessel making extension of perforation unlikely.
Angioseal femoral closure.

Assessment & Recommendations
1. Unsuccessful PCI of occluded LAD
2. No further intervention possible and known large anterior 
wall
motion abnormality, making medical therapy only option.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You came to ___ because you 
began experiencing chest pain on exertion over the past week. 
The chest pain resolved with rest. Given your extensive coronary 
artery disease history, you were admitted to the hospital for 
further evaluation of your coronary arteries. You were chest 
pain free in the hospital, and received a cardiac 
catheterization on ___ where it was found that your left 
main coronary artery was normal, your LAD had some stenosis 
after the proximal stent, then an area of severe stenosis and 
occlusion of your more distal LAD stent. Your left circumflex 
coronary artery was ___ stenotic, and your RCA had a 60% 
stenotic lesion. We were unable to stent the LAD, but were able 
to open parts of the vessel via angioplasty, which may relieve 
some of your chest discomfort. During the procedure, a small 
leak of dye was seen at the very end of your LAD, representative 
of a small perforation. You received an echocardiogram that 
showed no evidence of that perforation causing any bleeding 
around the lining of your heart.

After discharge, it will be important to follow up with your 
cardiologist to optimize your medical management. Keep a diary 
of the activities that bring on your chest pain. Changes to your 
medication regimen in the future may be able to reduce these 
periods of chest pain, and you should discuss this further with 
your cardiologist. 

As we discussed, your hospital studies are available to you via 
request to medical records.

It has been a real pleasure caring for you during this 
hospitalization, we wish you all the best in your recovery!

Kind Regards,
___ Cardiology

___ Bone Marrow
FINDINGS: An abnormal 46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) female chromosome 
complement with a
translocation involving the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 
was observed in 20 cells examined
in detail. Chromosome band resolution was 400-450. A karyogram 
was prepared on 3 cells.
CYTOGENETIC DIAGNOSIS: 46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[20]
INTERPRETATION/COMMENT: Every metaphase bone marrow cell 
examined had the
translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 that generates the 
___ chromosome
characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia. ___ has 
confirmed that this translocation has resulted in the BCR/ABL 
gene rearrangement (see ___).

___ Blood FISH
FISH: POSITIVE for BCR/ABL. 95% of the interphase peripheral 
blood cells examined had a probe signal pattern consistent with 
the BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangement brought about by the 
t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation characteristic of chronic 
myelogenous leukemia.
Uncultured cells for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
analysis with the ___ Molecular BCR/ABL1 dual color dual 
fusion translocation probe set: SpectrumOrange directly labeled 
probe for the ABL1 gene on ___ and SpectrumGreen directly 
labeled probe for the BCR gene on 22q11.2. This probe 
combination detects the BCR/ABL1
gene rearrangement brought about by the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) 
translocation characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia and 
seen in some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute 
myeloid leukemia.

FINDINGS: A total of 200 interphase nuclei were examined with 
the ABL1 and BCR dual color dual fusion probe set and 
fluorescence microscopy. 10 cells (5%) had 2 red signals and 2 
green signals. 190 cells (95%) had ___ yellow (red-green fusion) 
signals, 1 red signal and 1 green signal. Normal cut-off values 
for this probe set include: 89% for a normal 2 red
and 2 green probe signal pattern and 1% for a ___ yellow 
(red-green fusion), 1 red and 1 green signal pattern. nuc

___ Femur XR
FINDINGS: 
 
No acute fracture or dislocation.  No suspicious lytic or 
sclerotic lesions. 
Limited view of the right knee does not demonstrate joint 
effusion.  Limited
view of the right hip joint appears unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
No evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion within the 
right femur. 
MRI would be more sensitive for evaluation of osseous lesion.

___ Spleen US
FINDINGS:
 
 
SPLEEN: The spleen is enlarged measuring 14.5 cm in long axis.  
There are no
focal splenic lesions.  Normal vascular flow at the splenic 
hilum.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
14.5 cm splenomegaly without focal lesions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient Summary for Admission:
===============================
Ms ___ is a ___ yo woman with no major PMH presenting with RT 
leg pain over the past month with significant leukocytosis 
confirmed as CML. 

#CML
BCR-ABL confirmed on FISH analysis. Will initiate treatment 
after marrow for staging. Attempted bone marrow and only 
successful in getting Spleen size 14.5 and Eutos score 67.7 
predicts low risk disease. Initial testing was sent, G6PD 
remains pending, but infectious work up with HIV, hepatitis have 
been negative. TLS labs were followed. Patient was treated with 
hydroxyurea 1500 BID, fluids, and allopurinol. She was started 
on dastatinib. At time of discharge, Hydrea was stopped. Patient 
will continue ___nd continue Dasatinib.

#RT leg pain:
Fracture and clot have been excluded by XRAY and US. Other 
options include muscle strain, IT band strain, or bony pain from 
CML. MRI consistent with marrow CML infiltration. CML very 
rarely can create bone tumors that was initially a concern. No 
evidence of lytic lesions with no destruction of the cortex. 
Ortho was consulted and agreed she could resume weight bearing 
and this was most consistent with her normal CML. Pain initially 
treated with opioids, but patient had significant pain. She used 
gabapentin PRN as needed. Lidocaine patches were effective. 
Prior to discharge, patient transitioned to Tylenol for pain 
control.

#Dry cough
PNA vs pain associated. Possibly additional ___ pain. No 
findings on CXR. Cough resolved prior to discharge.

#Abdominal pain/nausea
Likely related to opioid use and anxiety combination. Opioids 
can last in system for 72 hours, will avoid for now. She also 
stopped her omeprazole during this admission due to TKI 
inhibitor interaction to acid reducers. Stopping antacids can 
cause increase in acid secretion which may have contributed to 
initial symptoms. Patient should not be discharged on antiacids. 
Nausea was controlled with Zofran and low dose Ativan. 

#Social complexity
#Anxiety
Complicated home situation and not surprising patient has 
significant anxiety. Patient amenable to following with a 
psychiatrist as an outpatient as she would like help coping and 
also working on her mood that she reports is labile. She will be 
referred to psych as an outpatient to someone near her on the 
___. 

#Contraception
Patient is obese, a women, and has a hematologic malignancy thus 
she should be treated without estrogens to prevent clot 
formation. She was started on norethindrone 3 weeks of pills 
followed by 1 week of no pills must take at the same time daily 
to prevent infection. She should use back up birth control with 
condoms for at least one month. OBGYN was used to help in 
decision making. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
[] Tums also alter the stomach acid and have a mild 
contraindication with TKIs consider if patient should be 
discharged on these medications
[] Patient will be continued on new birth control that is 
progesterone only. This will reduce her risk of clots. It should 
be continued for 3 weeks. The packs do not come with placebo 
pills, but she will take 1 week off her pills each month. 
[] Patient should continue dasatinib indefinitely. She will 
require close heme onc follow up with a physician at ___ 
and consultation with Dr. ___
[] Patient is amenable to psychiatric follow up, please ensure 
she is connected with a provider closer to home. 
[] Patient can weight bear on her leg
[] Patient states she was taking ativan 0.5 mg daily, last 
script filled in ___ per Mass reporting. Clarify script with 
outpatient PCP. Psychiatry can assist as an outpatient regarding 
management of medications. 
[]Allopurinol will continue for 2 weeks following discharge.
[]Short course of Ativan prescribed for management of 
significant nausea which can be worsened by Dasatinib. This 
medication should evaluated for ongoing use in the setting of 
significant anxiety.
[]Patient should not exceed more than 2 grams of Tylenol daily.

STUDY: CT of the head without contrast. ___ 
There is a large area of encephalomalacia involving the left 
occipital lobe, vascular territory of the left posterior 
cerebral artery, multiple areas of low attenuation in the 
periventricular white matter, indicating chronic microvascular 
ischemic disease, there is no evidence of acute hemorrhagic 
changes or shifting of the normally medial structures. Punctate 
dense atherosclerotic calcifications are visualized in the left 
medial cerebral artery, carotid siphons, and vertebral body 
basilar systems. Prominence of the sulci and ventricles is also 
noted, likely age related and involutional in nature. Prominence 
of the tip of the basilar artery is also noted, the possibility 
of arteriosclerotic changes versus aneurysmatic formation are 
considerations, CTA of the head is recommended if clinically 
warranted. The orbits appear grossly normal, the paranasal 
sinuses demonstrate normal pneumatization, as well as the 
mastoid air cells.   
IMPRESSION: Chronic ischemic changes are visualized on the left 
occipital 
lobe with associated encephalomalacia and asymmetry of the left 
occipital 
ventricular horn. Multiple areas of low attenuation are 
demonstrated in the periventricular white matter, likely 
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes. There is 
no evidence of acute hemorrhage or subdural hematoma. Dense 
arteriosclerotic calcifications are demonstrated in the carotid 
siphons, left medial cerebral artery, and vertebrobasilar system 
as described above. Prominent tip of the basilar artery is 
demonstrated, possibly related with arteriosclerotic changes, a 
small aneurysm cannot be completely excluded, CTA or MRA are 
recommended for further characterization of these findings. 
These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at the time 
of this interpretation. 
.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of ___
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is related to age-related 
parenchymal atrophy. Periventricular white matter 
hypoattenuation is consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease.  There is again calcification of the middle cerebral 
arteries, carotid siphons, 
and vertebrobasilar arterial system. There is no hemorrhage, 
edema, mass 
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. There is ex 
vacuo dilatation of the posterior horn of the left lateral 
ventricle with surrounding encephalomalacia, consistent with 
prior infarction.   
CTA HEAD: There is prominence at the tip of the basilar artery, 
which may 
represent a patulous basilar artery or a small aneurysm. Poor 
arterial 
opacification and lack of processed imaging limits evaluation. 
When processed images are become available, a separated addendum 
will be provided. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Prominence of tip of basilar artery may represent patulous 
basilar artery versus small aneurysm. Poor arterial 
opacification and lack of processed image limits evaluation, but 
an addendum will be generated. 
2. Calcifications of the intracranial vessels. 
3. Age-related parenchymal atrophy. 
4. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 
5. Encephalomalacia of the left occipital lobe, likely from 
prior infarction. 
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The aortic root is 
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Mildly dilated thoracic 
aorta.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#Rhythm-The patient was transferred to ___ for temporary 
transcutaneous pacemaker placement due to complete heart block 
with wide ventricular escape at 35 bpm. A temporary 
transcutaneous pacer was advanced to the RV apex via fluroscopic 
guidance and position was confirmed with fluorscopy. V threshold 
was set at 0.8 mA and V sensitivity threshold at >20 ms. ___ 
settings: VVI 70, V output 10 mA, V sensitivity 3 mV. Pt 
subsequently had a pacemaker placed without complication.  He 
did well and was monitored on telemetry x48 hours post 
procedure.  He was started on Metoprolol 12.5mg BID after the 
pacemkaer was placed for his known CAD. 
.  
# Pump: Overall EF 45% from ___ with global hypokinesis 
suggesting systolic dysfunction.  An echo was done which showed 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).  He was 
started on 40mg Lasix prior to discharge.
.  
# CAD/Ischemia:  Pt ruled out for an MI. He was continued on his 
lipitor, plavix, ramipril per home dosing. He was started on 
Metoprolol twice daily and aspirin.   
.  
#. Hypothyroidism- Initially there was concern that the patient 
may be hypothryoid which could contribute to heart block however 
TSH was wnl. Endocrine consulted at first but pt was on adequate 
synthroid replacement. He remained on his home synthroid dose 
and appt made for endocrine followup on discharge.
.  
# Dementia- Pt has dementia at baseline per daughter.
.  
# Basilar artery aneurysm/Left posterior infarct. Given mental 
status changes, there was initial concern for an intracerebral 
abnormality (given history of fall at home) and thus CT head was 
done. It showed no hemorrhage, but there was concern for a 
basilar artery aneurysm. Thus, a CTA Head was done which showed 
prominence of the tip of a basilar artery which may represent 
patulous basilar artery versus small aneurysm.  Further followup 
with the patient's PCP regarding this possible aneurysm is 
recommended; however, no acute neurosurgical interventions were 
deemed necessary. The patient was also noted to have a large 
left posterior old infarct with associated encephalomalacia and 
chronic SVID on this scan, likely related to ischemic dementia.

CT ___: IMPRESSION: Enhancing lytic mass involving the left 
posterior elements of T5 with left lateral epidural extension 
and near complete extension into the left T4/5 foramen.

Severe destructive changes of the T9 vertebral body and the T10 
vertebral body with focal kyphosis measuring approximately 50 
degrees. Approximately 2-cm anterior spondylolisthesis of T8 on 
T10. This is causing severe canal stenosis and likely 
compression of the cord.

High-density material seen within and around the destroyed T9 
vertebral body and right posterior elements with some 
well-circumscribed bony defects of the T9 body on the left. 
These findings likely represent prior corpectomy with graft 
material or polymethylmethacrylate placement. The lytic lesions 
causing the bony destructive changes at these levels likely 
represent metastases given the prior right nephrectomy. 
Differential diagnostic possibility would also include myeloma.

Mild anterior wedge deformity of the T11 vertebral body.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted to the hospital with 
shortness of breath and a fast heart rate. You had an EKG which 
showed you had a fast heart rate called atrial tachycardia. You 
had a cardiac ablation to stop the atrial tachycardia and your 
heart rate improved.

You also had shortness of breath likely due to your fast heart 
rate causing fluid to build up in your lung. You received 
medication called lasix to remove the fluid and your breathing 
improved. You also had an ultrasound of your heart called an 
echocardiogram that showed your heart was not pumping as well 
(poor systolic function). This is likely due to your fast heart 
rate and will hopefully improve in time.

You had an injury to your kidneys from the contrast dye given to 
evaluate your lungs for blood clots in the ED. You were given 
fluids and monitored, and your kidneys recovered their function.

Because your kidneys are still getting better, we have changed 
some of your medications. When you leave the hospital, you will 
be taking Lisinopril 5mg a day (half of your old dose). We did 
not restart Lasix (a water pill), since you were already 
urinating a lot. The medicines can be changed or added back on 
by your primary care doctor, based on how you are doing at your 
follow up appointment.

Please follow-up with your PCP to get labs drawn on ___. Also 
follow up with you Cardiologist; we are working on making you an 
appointment to see an electrophysiologist. We have also made you 
an appointment with a kidney doctor to follow up how your 
kidneys are improving.

All the best,
Your ___ Team

Cardiac Catheterization ___
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
demonstrated the LMCA to be patent with diffuse calcifications 
and 90% stenosis of the proximal vessel.  The LMCA only supplied 
a few small diagonals.  The LCx filled by collaterals to the OM1 
and OM2.  The RCA was stents were widely patent proximally with 
in-stent restenosis in the stents in the proximal RPDA. 
2. Arterial conduit angiography of the LIMA was deferred as it 
was widely patent by angiography 3 months ago.  Venous conduit 
angiography of the SVG->D branch demonstarted a degenerated vein 
graft to a patent diagonal branch without angiographic evidence 
of flow limiting stenosis. The SVG->OM and SVG->RCA were known 
to be occluded and were not engaged. 
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal central aortic 
pressure 138/81mmHg. 
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the R-PDA with three 
overlapping 2.5 x 15mm Xience drug eluting stents. Final 
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically 
apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is an 83-year-old male who was admitted with chest pain. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. He was recently hospitalized for recurrent chest pain and was found to have a positive troponin I level. He was started on heparin and nitroglycerin drips and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed diffuse disease in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, patent LIMA to LAD, and collaterals to the left circumflex (LCx) via the obtuse marginal (OM) branch. Two of the four RCA stents showed restenosis, and three Xience stents were placed in the restenosed posterior descending (PDA) artery. The patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix, atenolol, simvastatin, and lisinopril.

The patient's allergies include penicillins. His past medical history includes CAD risk factors, hypertension, and a history of CABG. He has also had a recent hospitalization for recurrent chest pain and was transferred to another hospital for possible CABG but was deemed not to be a surgical candidate.

The patient's physical examination revealed a normal sinus rhythm, normal blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. His chest pain was not reproducible upon palpation. His laboratory results showed a normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but an elevated troponin I level.

The patient's discharge medications include atenolol, aspirin, Plavix, simvastatin, lisinopril, and nitroglycerin. ||endoftext||"

sided breast mass with pathology showing grade 2 invasive ductal
carcinoma ER/PR+, HER2-, with a positive FNA of an axillary node
and concern on imaging for metastatic disease to the
sternum/manubrium. She had noticed a breast mass in the right
breast detected on self exam for about 6 months. CT torso ___
showed a 4.2cm irregularly marginated medial right breast mass
which was highly suspicious for a breast cancer arising within a
radiation port, with additional smaller lesions superior
laterally in the right breast as well as right-sided skin
thickening and diffuse lucencies throughout the sternum, and
diffuse pulmonary nodules concerning for metastatic disease.
Mammogram ___ showed the 4 cm right breast mass, highly
suspicious for invasive carcinoma with invasion into the

axillary
lymph nodes. She had an ultrasound guided breast core needle
biopsy ___ which showed ER/PR+ HER-2 negative invasive 
ductal
carcinoma, grade II, measuring 15mm in the limited sample. She
also had an FNA of an axillary LN that showed metastatic 
disease.
___ she had a bone scan which showed increased radiotracer
uptake within the manubrium and sternum. Her imaging including 
CT
and bone scan were reviewed and thought to be consistent with an
osseous metastatic disease process, and her pulmonary nodules
were also concerning for metastatic disease. There was no 
mention
of
pulmonary nodules on a previous CTA at ___ ___ which had 
diagnosed her with a PE. Bone biopsy of the sternum was 
performed

vein thrombosis
in the left upper extremity.

CXR ___
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with subjacent 
atelectasis
and/or consolidation as well as mild but unchanged pulmonary 
edema.

CT Chest w/ contrast ___. Compared to 2 weeks prior, scattered ground-glass opacities 
most prominent
in the paramediastinal parenchyma and lower lobes has improved, 
probably
improved edema.
2. Heterogeneous right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged since 
at least
___, probably chronic collapse, though superimposed 
infection cannot
be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=====================
___ year old woman with stage IV ER/PR+/HER2- breast cancer (on 
C1D12 of paclitaxel), malignant pleural effusion s/p R TPC (___), PE on rivaroxaban, dCHF, AS s/p TAVR, mitral stenosis 
presented with cough, dyspnea and diarrhea. She was found to 
have Cdiff infection and pneumonia, and was started on 
antiobiotic treatment. She was initially transferred to ICU due 
to low blood pressure and concern for sepsis. She was shortly 
kept on pressors, but upon communication with primary 
oncologist, it was found that her pressures normally run very 
low. Patient was transferred to the floor but then she quickly 
returned to the FICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. This 
was felt to be related to flash pulmonary edema. She was 
diuresed with IV Lasix 20mg and was started on BiPAP. She was 
weaned off BiPAP after diuresis and received further diuresis 
with improvement in respiratory status. BPs remained stable. She 
was continued on cefepime for treatment of HAP and was continued 
on po vancomycin for c. difficile colitis until ___ when she 
completed her course. On the floor she remained stable on ___ 
O2 requirements, which were weaned down to 0.5L with her 
diuresis which also were tapered to Lasix 40mg PO daily. Her 
blood pressures continued to fluctuate into low realms, however, 
improved in inverse reflection of her diuretic taper to levels 
where she able to undergo extensive in house ___ and become 
re-conditioned physically.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
#Sespis: Patient presented with tachypnea to 33, leukocytosis, 
and potential respiratory vs. abdominal source given symptoms. 
She was given 3L IVF in ED. She was started on treatment for HAP 
with vancomycin and cefepime. Was also found to be positive for 
C. diff, and was started on PO vancomycin in the ICU. Blood 
pressure initially required support with levophed which was 
weaned off in ICU within 1 day of admission after contact with 
primary oncologist confirmed that her baseline BPs run in the 
mid ___. Patient was subsequently transferred to medical floor, 
however returned quickly to ___ due to hypoxemic respiratory 
failure (see below).

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Malignant pleural effusion: 
Causes for her acute worsening dyspnea and hypoxia on the floor 
was believed to be flash pulmonary edema. Possible triggers 
included HTN (SBP 158 - baseline 80-90s), decompensated HF (BNP 
900s from 400s), tachycardia (120s from baseline 100s), 
worsening pleural effusion (150 cc drained ___, Trop and EKG 
without evidence of ischemia. She has stabilized with 20 mg IV 
Lasix, duoneb and BiPAP, transferred back to the floor. Pleurx 
was also frequently drained which helped improved hypoxia. 
Diuresis was continued on the floor however patient continued to 
have blood pressures on low ___, prompting taper of diuresis to 
40mg Lasix PO daily which reflected improvement in her BP, 
albeit it lingers below average. Pleurx was capped with plan for 
patient to continue two to three-times-per-week drainage on 
M(W)F and remove fluid as needed for comfort.

#Orthostatic hypotension: Likely related to volume status in the 
setting of ongoing diuresis, with possible contribution from 
olanzapine medication side effect. Improved w/ further ___ 
conditioning. Continued PO Lasix 40 daily, decreased from BID 
and TID earlier this admission. Continued ___ rehabilitation 
during admission and cleared for home. Continued olanzapine at 
decreased dose of 5mg qHS.

#Nausea/Vomiting: Attempted various permutations of medications 
but ultimately succeeded with suppression via pre-meal 
medication with Reglan, increased to appropriate dose. Continued 
on Caphosol for dry mouth, olanzapine 5mg QHS, Zofran PRN 
breakthrough (avoided standing as pt has developed tachyphylaxis 
in the past), and EKG q3d for QTc monitoring which have been 
unremarkable.

#Hospital acquired pneumonia: Presented with dyspnea, cough, 
presence of effusion and ?opacity on admission which was 
concerning for pneumonia. Initiated on vanc/cefepime on ___ 
for presumed HAP given recent hospitalization. Completed 
cefepime (___). Received vancomycin briefly (___) 
until MRSA swab was found to be negative. Cough was managed with 
Sodium Chloride 3% Inhalation Soln 15 mL NEB Q6H.

#HFpEF
#Mitral stenosis: likely due to mitral annular calcification 
with intermittent pulmonary edema during chemotherapy. Last ECHO 
on ___ demonstrated LVEF >55%, severe functional mitral 
stenosis, well seated aortic valve prosthesis. Notably, her 
tumor has shown signs of progression in her liver and lungs 
despite chemotherapy with 5 agents. Per Dr ___ (___) 
the risks of TMVR given her progressive metastatic disease are 
very high. Upon discharge, the patient will follow-up with Dr 
___ scheduling of a cardiac CT to reassess her risks and 
potential TMVR intervention. Lasix was 40mg PO daily at 
discharge, with discharge weight of 43.59kg 96.1lbs 

#Metastatic Breast Cancer: Patient originally on C1 of 
Paclitaxel, after failing multiple chemo regimens. Found to have 
metastatic pulmonary nodules and lymphangitic spread likely 
contributing to her hypoxia. Patient's further chemotherapy 
regimen was determined by her outpatient oncologist and fellow 
in-house given her length-of-stay and was started on eribulin in 
house ___, and second dose ___. Her CBC w/ diff has 
been followed during this therapy. Discontinued superfluous 
medications as ASA, atorvastatin, and decreased 
hydroxychloroquine to 200mg daily given weight changes. She will 
have follow up in outpatient ___ clinic for continuation of 
treatment. 

#C. Diff colitis: Patient presented with hypotension with 
initial possible sources including PNA was later found to have 
c. diff colitis. Patient was able to be weaned off of pressors 
after discovery that her baseline blood pressures are in the 
___. Patient was initiated on PO Vancomycin which she continued 
until ___. Per oncology floor policy, remained on precautions 
following the conclusion of her treatment.

#Macrocytic anemia: Hgb ~10 from baseline ~11, possibly in 
setting of fluid resuscitation vs. recent chemotherapy. Anemia 
remained stable.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___!

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED?
You were admitted because he were found to have weakness and 
hypotension by your ___.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?
You were initially started on antibiotics for a presumed 
infection.  You also received fluids in order to raise your 
blood pressure.  Your infectious workup showed that you have an 
infection with C. difficile, as well as a pneumonia.  For this 
you were started on oral vancomycin which you took until ___. For your pneumonia you completed a 7 day course with 
cefepime.
You were also found to have increased oxygen requirements due in 
part to increased fluid accumulation around your lung.  This 
fluid was drained through your Pleurx and this helped improved 
your oxygen requirements. 
You had a short course in the ICU for management of your oxygen 
requirements, where you received diuresis (to remove the fluid 
from your lungs) and a BiPAP machine (to improve your 
breathing). 
After your stay in the ICU, you were transferred to a regular 
oncology floor where you remained stable on ___ Oxygen, however 
your blood pressures continued to be low. Due to this reason we 
had to stop your water pills temporarily but then we restarted 
them again since your fluid status was difficult to control.
You were weaned down to a dose of one water pill per day to 
maximize treatment of your shortness of breath while allowing 
you to hold your blood pressure and work with physical therapy. 
You continued to work with physical therapy in the hospital 
until you were re-conditioned to be able to work with your 
family at home to get stronger.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AT HOME?
You need to continued taking your medications as prescribed and 
follow-up with the appointments scheduled for you.
 
You should have your pleurx drained ___ times a week (M(W)F). 
You can take out as much fluid as you can until you start 
feeling uncomfortable.

Thank you for allowing us be involved in your care, we wish you 
all the best!

Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
====================

Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with DM2, well controlled HLD, 
___ plaque and recent transient left field cut who was 
admitted for further work-up of this event. 

# NEUROLOGY:
He was admitted to the stroke service from ___ to ___ given 
concern that his transient left field cut was related to 
cardioembolic or proximal artery-to-artery embolus. Ultimately 
he was thought to have had a TIA. MRI was negative for stroke. 
TTE showed only preexisting VSD, however TEE showed complex, 
nonmobile atheroma in the aortic arch. Given risk for subsequent 
emboli, discussion was held with the patient, wife, and Dr. 
___ the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation 
vs dual antiplatelet therapy.  The patient chose dual 
antiplatelet therapy and was started on plavix and baby aspirin. 
 His stroke risk factors included hypertension, hyperlipidemia 
(although LDL- 54 well controlled on Crestor), diabetes (A1c 
9.3%).  His home rosuvasation and lantus were continued.  Given 
his recent visual field cut and our imprecise VF impatient 
testing, we advised Mr ___ not to drive until formal VF 
testing is done and there is confirmation that he can respond to 
all parts of his VFs to drive safetly.  A letter to his employer 
was generated, explaining this restriction. 

# ___: 
He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and was 
continued on his home meds: amlodipine, lasix, metoprolol, 
trandolapril, crestor. For his complex atheroma in the aortic 
arch, he was started on asa81 and plavix.

# ENDOCRINE:  
Poorly controlled diabetes, A1c 9.3%. He continued his lantus 
and glipizide.  We discussed the ___ of diet and 
exercise.

====================

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1) Needs formal VF testing prior to returning to driving.
2) Started on plavix & asa 81, but may need to consider systemic 
anticoagulation if further embolic phenomenon
3) Would benefit from ___ visits again in the future. 
4) PACT team is following

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to 
___.  You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left visual 
field cut resulting from a transient ischemic attack (a mini 
stroke), a condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen 
and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is 
the part of your body that controls and directs all the other 
parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived 
of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
1) high cholesterol including cholesterol in your aorta (large 
vessel leaving your heart
2) high blood pressure
3) diabetes mellitus

We are changing your medications as follows:
1) START Plavix 75mg daily
2) DECREASE your Aspirin dose to only 81mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Because of your visual problems last week, it is important for 
you to have a complete visual field test at your 
ophthalmologists office.  You CANNOT drive until you have this 
test completed and the results are approved by your 
ophthalmologist. 

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

Old inferior infarct.

CAROTID US ___
Right ICA <40% stenosis. 
Left ICA <40% stenosis. 
Delayed upstroke in the bilateral ICAs, and more subtle delay in 
the CCA is most likely due to known known severe aortic 
stenosis. 
There is significant calcification artifact in the proximal 
right ICA thus the severity of stenosis may be underestimated, 
consider cross-sectional imaging if concerning symptoms are 
present. 

ANKLE 3 VIEWS ___
No acute fractures or dislocations are seen. There are mild 
degenerative 
changes of the anterior tibiotalar joint with spurring.  
Vascular 
calcifications are seen.There are calcaneal spurs.  There are 
mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of the talonavicular 
joint.  There is mild overall demineralization.

SUMMARY STATEMENT
=================
___ year old male with CAD with recent PCI, Afib, ESRD on ___
HD, HTN who presents after syncopal episode likely due to vagal 
episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention 
for severe aortic stenosis (EF 60%, peak vel 4.4m/sec, peak 
gradient 77mgHg, mean gradient 45mm, valve area 0.8cm2 ___ 
dimensionless index 0.20; per ___ TTE dimensionless index was 
0.25)
[] continue hemodialysis MFW via fistula
[] consider stopping metoprolol tartrate in setting of EF 60%, 
dose was decreased from 25 mg twice daily to 12.5 mg twice daily 
during this admission (due to bradycardia)
[] stopped Imdur due to lower BPs and severe AS

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# syncopal episode
# severe aortic stenosis
Likely vagal in etiology, but concerning in the context of 
severe aortic stenosis (EF 60%, peak vel 4.4m/sec, peak gradient 
77mgHg, mean gradient 45mm, valve area 08cm2). It is unknown how 
long this patient has had this for and at which severity was 
this last classified. Patient does remember having an 
echocardiogram done ___, but recalls no plans to intervene. 
Telemetry during admission only pertinent for slightly prolonged 
PR interval and mild bradycardia. Carotid ultrasound revealed 
not clinically significant stenosis of both carotid arteries, 
less than 40% stenosis. Patient is to immediately report to 
___'s emergency room with the help of his 
daughters once landing in ___ as he is adamant about not 
wanting to undergo work up and intervention here in ___ due 
to insurance costs and understandably being away from 
home/support. He understands the risks involved in this plan 
including delaying of care and potential mortality, and is 
willing to accept them.

TTE ___
Conclusion: The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. 
There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal 
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal. However, the inferior wall is hypokinetic. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade 
II diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricular cavity size 
with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
The aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending 
aorta diameter. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. 
There is SEVERE aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or 
less). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

# CAD: EKG showing prior inferior MI. Recent stent placed in
___. Currently without angina. Continue metoprolol, 
clopidogrel and statin. Imdur discontinued in light of softer 
pressures and EF of 60%

# Elevated troponin: patient without chest pain and has ESRD.
Defered trending further in absence of concern for ACS. Can 
consider a demand etiology in light of stenotic valve

# Anemia: likely from chronic renal disease. B12
studies and TSH within normal limits.

# ESRD on HD: on ___ dialysis. Dialysis received on ___ 
___. Calcium acetate binder with meals was continued.

# pAF: currently in sinus. Metoprolol tartrate 25mg was 
decreased to 12.5mg BID in light of persistent bradycardia and 
soft pressures. Consider discontinuing metoprolol altogether in 
light of EF 60%. Eliquis dose reduced 2.5mg in setting of age 
and ESRD.

#T2DM: continue Lantus and ISS.

#HTN: continued norvasc, discontinued isosorbide dinitrate in 
light of soft pressures and EF of 60%

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is an 81-year-old male who presented with a syncopal episode after a baseball game. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), and atrial fibrillation (Afib). He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were notable for a temperature of 97.2°F, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 151/48 mmHg. His physical examination revealed a bradycardic rhythm, normal rhythm, and a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium.

Laboratory results showed elevated levels of troponin (0.53 ng/mL) and creatinine (11.0 mg/dL), as well as mild anemia (Hgb 11.3 g/dL). Imaging studies revealed severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0 cm² or less, as well as mild degenerative changes in the ankle joints.

The patient was prescribed medications at discharge, including Eliquis for Afib and metoprolol tartrate for hypertension. He was also advised to undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention for severe aortic stenosis, continue hemodialysis three times a week, and consider stopping metoprolol tartrate due to bradycardia.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was marked by a syncopal episode likely due to a vagal episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis, and he was discharged with recommendations for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
#MCA and ACOM aneurysms 
Patient was admitted for elective Right Craniotomy for clipping 
of R MCA and ACOM aneurysm. Case was uncomplicated and well 
tolerated. He was extubated in the OR and transferred to the 
PACU for recovery. He boarded in PACU overnight, and was 
transferred to ___ on the morning of POD1. He remained 
neurologically stable. He was transferred to the floor on ___.  
He remained stable and was discharged home on ___.

#Nausea/vomiting/ileus
Post operatively, the patient had ongoing nausea and multiple 
episodes of vomiting. This was initially treated stepwise with 
IV zofran, scopalamine patch, and PR compazine which did not 
resolve his symptoms. An abdominal XR showed dilated loops of 
small bowel and stool/gas filled large bowel, which was 
suggestive of ileus. An NG tube was placed at bedside, and prior 
to connection to wall suction, a chest XR confirmed placement in 
stomach. He was made NPO and his bowel regimen was increased. 
___ Repeat KUB was obtained. NGT was taken off suction and 
patient was monitored. ACS was consulted. His NGT was removed 
and diet was slowly advanced.  He started producing flatus and 
had BM x 3.  N/V improved and he tolerated a diet.

#Hypertension
Post-operatively, he was hypertensive, over his SBP goal of less 
than 140. This required maximum dosing of nicardipine drip, as 
well as alternation of iv labetalol/hydralazine. His pain 
medications were increased, with concern for undertreated pain 
as exacerbation of his hypertension.

#Urinary retention
Patient had a foley for the operation, which was discontinued on 
POD1. He had small void amounts, which prompted bladder 
scanning, revealing high PVRs. He was straight cathed x1.

#Methadone dependence
He was maintained on his home dose of methadone while admitted.

 
Medications on Admission:
 methadone, lisinopril, clonidine, albuterol and Pantoloc.

& R axilla, cognitive defect, transferred to ___ from ___ 
___ found to have NSTEMI on hep gtt with troponin 0.3 
downtrending to .22 with outside EKG <1mm lateral ST 
depressions, on CTA found to have 2.7cm upper left lobe nodule 
with significant hilar lymphadenopathy. Upon admission, patient 
was placed on a heparin drip and received PRN nitroglycerin for 
control of chest pain. Patient was taken to the cath lab on 
___ that showed 60% stenosis of his RCA and 30% stenosis of 
LCx. No intervention was performed. He was started on ASA, 
statin a beta-blocker for his CAD. Patient continued to complain 
of chest pain, but given the cath results this was thought to be 
unlikely caused by cardiac disease. He had an incidental finding 
of a RUL lung nodule and significant hilar lymphadenopathy. 
Patient reported recent night sweats with unintentional 30-lb 
weight loss. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with hilar lymph node biopsy as an 
outpatient. Additionally, the patient had on-going rectal pain 
due to his ___ wound. Dermatology and colorectal surgery 
were consulted and recommended wound care. Biopsies and further 
work up were deferred for the outpatient setting. Patient also 
developed loose stools with incontinence concerning for C diff 
given history. He was started and discharged with a prescription 
for PO vancomycin. 

  
 # CORONARIES: unknown

 # RHYTHM: sinus    

# NSTEMI: Patient presented with three days of chest pain, peak 
trop 0.3, EKG with <1mm STD in lateral leads. Patient EKG did 
show evidence of old inferolateral infarct. Patient was started 
on a heparin drip for NSTEMI. Chest pain required nitroglycerin 
and intermittently oxycodone/IV morphine for relief. Patient 
underwent coronary catheterization on ___ which revealed 
RCA 60% stenosis and LCx 30% stenosis. No intervention was 
performed. Patient began ASA, Atorvastatin, metoprolol for CAD 
medical management. Following cath, patient continued to have 
chest pain that was largely unchanged. Multiple EKGs pre and 
post cath did not show new changes or signs of ischemia. While 
the patient had documented CAD on cath, it is possible that some 
of his chest pain was also due to demand ischemia given give 
___ wounds. Pain ___ also be due to hilar 
lymphadenopathy found on CTA. Interventional pulmonology was

etiology. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with biopsy as an outpatient. Patient 
is scheduled for bronchoscopy on ___. 

# Hydradinitis Suppurative Lesions: Patient with lesions in  
axilla, groin, and perianal area are consistent with the 
distribution seen in hidradinitis suppurativa. He has started to 
see improvement in his right axillary lesion but his perianal 
lesions are unchanged.  Dermatology was consulted for re-biopsy 
of anal wound given concern given differing pathology reports 
and unclear diagnosis given refractory nature of his perianal 
lesion. There was no evidence of infection on exam. Colorectal 
surgery was also consulted who discussed patient case with derm. 
___ wounds are painful and of unclear etiology. DDx 
includes verrucous carcinoma vs pyoderma gangrenosum. Since

[ ] Incidental nodule and hilar LAD on CT requiring 
bronchoscopy/biopsy. Ensure patient follows up with 
interventional pulmonology. Procedure is scheduled for ___ 
[ ] Did not require cath and chest pain is unlikely cardiac, but 
cath did show CAD; therefore, the patient was started on 
atorvastatin 80mg daily, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 BID and 
aspirin 81mg 
[ ] Patient reported attempting to self-taper his alprazolam. He 
was advised to do this under the guidance of a physician. Please 
follow up his benzo use and desire to taper.

He presents to the emergency department with a non-functioning left upper extremity fistula, which was placed several years ago. The patient has been asymptomatic until recently, when he developed a large ulcer on his left calf due to calciphylaxis. He was unable to undergo dialysis at his dialysis center due to the non-functioning fistula.

The patient underwent a balloon dilation and thrombectomy of the left radiocephalic fistula, which was successful in restoring flow to the arterial portion of the fistula. He was also found to have mixed bacterial flora in his wound cultures, including Corynebacterium species and a mixed bacterial flora.

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and he was noted to have shallow ulcers on his right posterior calf and a larger ulcer on his left posterior calf with granulation tissue and yellow exudate. He was prescribed medications for pain management and was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his calciphylaxis and fistula.

___ Cardiology ECHO 
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Minimal aortic valve sclerosis. No vegetations 
identified. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man with history of AML s/p allo-BMT ___ who presents 
with tender cutaneous lesions and polycythemia.  He had 
presented to clinic with splinter hemorrhages but had negative 
blood cultures and TTE on ___.  He also had polycythemia with 
an elevated erythropoeitin level.  
His fingers became painful and he was admitted for an expedited 
workup of splinter hemorrhages.  On admission his finger (left 
index finger) was slightly discolored.  He had blood cultures 
that were negative.  He has a TTE that was negative and then a 
TEE, which he tolerated well.  Both tests showed no signs of 
vegetations on the valves or thrombi.  It was felt that 
endocarditis as a cause of his finger lesions (splinter 
hemorrhages) was unlikely in the face of this data.  He also did 
not have these lesions else where.  A differential including 
GVHD vasculitis or rheumatological vasculitidies was formulated 
and a rheumatology consult was called.  Extensive serologies 
were sent, and his ___ was positive with a titer of 1:320.  This 
was felt to be non-specific.  A hypercoagulability panel was 
sent with negative results.  He also had negative cryoglobulins. 
 Rheumatology had suggested that he be evaluated by dermatology 
for his skin changes (distal digits had started becoming 
slightly purple-blue).  Vascular surgery had also evaluated him. 
 They felt that this was not a surgical issue as he had 
dopplerable pulses to the mid-phalanx.  They also felt that an 
MRA or CTA of his arms would not be helpful as he had 
dopplerable pulses and likely did not have a thrombi occluding 
his vessels.  He had an ultrasound of his arteries in the upper 
extremities which was normal.  He was started on Solumedrol 40mg 
a day. Dermatology had suggested that there may be a 
vaso-spastic element to his finger presentation. He was started 
on Nifedipine 10mg po bid and NTG oitment to his fingertips.  
This was somewhat helpful with his finger pain.  A CT-A of his 
right arm was performed that showed atherosclerosis of his ulnar 
and radial artery, no evidence of vasculitis was seen.  
Cholesterol levels were obtained for risk stratification.   He 
had an acute worsening  of the color of his fingertips (to a 
more intense purple-blue) with maintenance of his pulses.  His 
solumedrol dose was increased to 250mg q 6 hours and his 
cellcept was increased to 500mg po tid.  Dermatology was spoken 
with and they performed a skin biopsy before the higher dose 
solumedrol and cellcept was initiated. In addition a heparin gtt 
was initiated.  One day following the 1g per day solumedrol and 
anticoagulation, his fingertips improved in pain and pallor.  
The results of the biopsy showed one arteriole with a waxy 
deposit consistent with cyroglobulins and one thrombus in an 
arteriole.  No vasculitis was seen.  
Repeat cryoglobulins were sent, and were hand delivered in a 
warm water bath to ensure that they did not precipitate en 
route.  The results were negative.  
After 3 days on anticoagulation it was stopped as it was decided 
that the risk outweighed the benefit (as he is unsteady 
secondary to his cerebral palsy)and the indication for 
anticoagulation was not present.  His fingers continued to be 
improved.  The solumedrol was gradually tapered to prednisone 
40mg a day and eventually to 30mg a day prior to discharge.  On 
___ he received Rituxan as it has been used in 
cryoglobulinemia.  He tolerated it well.  At the time of 
discharge his finger lesions were felt to be due to a 
vasculopathy with a vasospastic element. 
He had an increase in lower extremity edema that was felt to be 
secondary to the high dose steroids but a lower extremity 
ultrasound was done to assess for DVTs.  This exam was negative. 
  
His blood sugars were quite elevated after the initiation of 
high dose steroids.  He was followed by the ___ clinic.  He 
required q 6 hours NPH and a sliding scale.  As his steroids 
were tapered his insulin needs decreased.  He was discharged on 
glipizide and once daily 70/30.
His hematocrit remained high and an epo level was tested again 
to confirm the initial high reading.  The repeat epo was high.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with lesions on your fingers called ""splinter 
hemorrhages"".  We looked at your heart (with an echocardiogram) 
to make sure that there were no clots that were traveling to 
your fingers and causing decreased blood flow.  You had several 
blood tests looking for processes that attack blood vessels that 
were negative.  You had a skin biopsy and a CT of your arm to 
look at your blood vessels.  Blood thinner (heparin) and high 
dose steroids were started to treat your fingers.  Your fingers 
started improving and you were taken off the blood thinner.  
Because of the high dose steroids you had high blood sugar and 
you needed insulin.  Your fingers were improved and remained 
that way.  It was decided that a vasculopathy possibly due to 
GVHD is the likely cause of this.
You should continue to take your medications as prescribed.  We 
increased your cellcept to 500mg three times a day.  You are 
also on prednisone 30mg a day now, you should continue to take 
this until instructed by Dr. ___.  You are also on a 
medication called glipizide (for diabetes), you will take 10mg 
of this in the morning before breakfast and 5mg at bedtime.  You 
will also be taking insulin (called ___ 50 units in the 
morning.  It is important to check your blood sugar before 
taking any of these diabetes medications.  If your sugar is 
below ___ you should not take the medication.  If it is 65 or 
below you should call your doctor.  If your blood sugar is over 
___ you should call your doctor.  
Please call your doctor if you have any increased pain in your 
fingers, headache, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting, fevers, chills or any other concerning symptoms.
It is important that you follow up as outlined below.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care surgery Service on ___ 
with right groin swelling and abdominal pain. You were found to 
have an inguinal hernia which is when a piece of your bowel goes 
through a hold in the abdominal wall and gets stuck there. You 
underwent surgery to have the piece of intestine put back in and 
a piece of mesh placed over the hole to prevent the problem from 
happening again. You are now doing better, tolerating a regular 
diet, and ready to be discharged from the hospital to continue 
your recovery from surgery.

Please note the following discharge instructions:

Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the

per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids. Avoid lifting 
weights greater than ___ lbs until you follow-up with your 
surgeon.

Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain 
medications.

Incision Care:
*Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have 
increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision 
site.
*Avoid swimming and baths until your follow-up appointment.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap 
and warm water. Gently pat the area dry.
*If you have staples, they will be removed at your follow-up 
appointment.

History of Present Illness:
___ G0 with metastatic papillary serous ovarian CA transferred 
from OSH. Pt initially presented to OSH on ___ with abdominal 
pain, distention, constipation (last BM ___, increased 
belching.  Pain started as vague discomfort, but progressed to 
pain throughout that was sharp, intermittent, exacerbated by 
movement.  She was unable to tolerate PO at the time that she 
presented to OSH.  At the referring institution, she had a CT 
scan with PO contrast which demonstrated small bowel 
pneumatosis. She was transferred to the Gyn-Onc service for 
further care. The colorectal surgical service was consulted for 
the radiologic findings, she was made NPO, had NGT placed with 
return of bilious fluid.  Given a WBC of 1.9 (37% bands), she 
was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ertapenem and 
levofloxacin) because of concern for sepsis, but eventually 
transitioned to vanc/zosyn.  Admission labs were also 
significant for Cr 1.8, AST 49, and ALT 30. Pt then underwent

IMAGING:
-___ KUB: 1. No overt radiologic evidence of small-bowel 
obstruction or ileus 2. Nasoenteric tube with the tip likely 
projecting over the region consistent with body of the stomach. 

-___ CXR:1. New moderately large left and small right pleural 
effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis. 2. Satisfactory 
position of peripherally inserted central venous catheter.  

-___ Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis in bilateral 
kidneys.

-___ CXR: Increased density at the left base consistent with 
parenchymal 
consolidation. Bilateral pleural effusions may obscure the 
underlying 
pulmonary opacities. There is no definite change. 

-___ CT ABD &Pelvis: 1. Partially rim-enhancing fluid 
collection within the anterior midline abdomen in close 
proximity to the transverse colon surgical chain sutures. 
Underlying superinfection cannot be excluded and the collection 
is amenable to needle aspiration if needed.  2. No findings of 
bowel obstruction or leak. Persistent but slightly improved 
edematous appearance of the remaining large bowel when compared 
to the outside ___ exam. 3. Nonspecific enhancement 
and fluid in the right paracolic gutter. While this may 
represent post-procedural change, underlying peritoneal disease 
is also possible in this patient with known metastatic disease. 
4. Renal cysts including a hyperdense cyst off the left lower 
pole. 5. Bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion. 


-___ CXR: In comparison with study of ___, the right base 
shows substantial clearing with moderate atelectatic streaking 
and probable small effusion. On the left, however, there is 
still extensive opacification consistent with pleural effusion, 
atelectasis, and possibly supervening pneumonia in the 
appropriate clinical setting. 

-___ CT abd: 1. Slight interval decrease in size to partially 
organized intra-abdominal fluid collection within the midline 
abdomen which is of higher density today and may suggest 
decreasing phlegmon or evolving hematoma. A small amount of air 
within this collection is likely related to recent attempted 
aspiration. No new fluid collections or extraluminal oral 
contrast is present. 2. Persistent edema and wall thickening 
involving the visualized large bowel, most pronounced in the 
region of the splenic flexure. Slight interval worsening of 
small bowel wall thickening and mesenteric induration in the 
left upper quadrant. This may reflect postoperative change, 
serositis, and/or tumor infiltration. No bowel obstruction. 3. 
Interval increase in moderate-size simple left pleural effusion 
resulting in complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe. 4. 
Fatty liver. 

-___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, left PICC line 
is in 
unchanged position. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has 
almost 
completely resolved. The pre-existing left pleural effusion 
shows a slightly different distribution but is overall unchanged 
in extent. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac 
atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. 

-___ CT chest: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. Moderate left and 
trace right pleural effusions with overlying pulmonary 
atelectasis. 3. Bilateral prominent hilar lymph nodes as well as 
numerous, though not frankly enlarged upper mediastinal and 
supraclavicular lymph nodes. Close attention to these areas is 
recommended given the history of known malignancy. 

-___ CT abd: Limited study without intravenous or enteric 
contrast 
demonstrating post-operative changes with no definable 
intra-abdominal fluid collection for drainage. 

-___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of 
the 
pre-existing left pleural effusion is unchanged. A minimal right 
pleural 
effusion is newly visualized. Moderate bilateral basal 
atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. 
Unchanged course of the left PICC line. No pulmonary edema. No 
focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia 

-___ CT chest:1. Despite evidence of aspiration, attributable to 
the over distended esophagus, the large areas of consolidation 
at the lung bases, by virtue of their persistence and relative 
homogeneity, are indistinguishable as either atelectasis alone 
or atelectasis and pneumonia. There is no pneumonia in the upper 
or middle lobes. Persistent bilateral pleural effusion, moderate 
on the left and small on the right. 

-___ CT chest, abd and pelvis: 1. No evidence of PE. Mild 
pulmonary edema and increased bilateral pleural effusions. 
Bilateral lower lobe bronchial mucoid impaction and atelectasis; 
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  2. Small bowel 
ileus, with patent ileostomy.  3. Intact ___ pouch, with 
apparent mild wall thickening. Please correlate for inflammatory 
or infectious colitis. 4. Mild ascites, partially loculated in 
anterior omentum. Irregular enhancement may represent 
inflammation or peritoneal metastasis. 5. Emphysema and 
pulmonary hypertension. 

-___ CXR: 1. Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe 
collapse and/or consolidation, similar or possibly slightly 
worse. 2. Interval resolution right effusion, but new plate-like 
right base atelectasis 
.
Tissue biospy pathology:
1.  Right colectomy (A-H):
A.  Focal perforation.
B.  Extensive acute and organizing serositis.
C.  Focal serosal carcinoma consistent with patient's known 
serous ovarian carcinoma.
2.  Terminal ileum, resection (J-L):
Acute and organizing serositis
.
Pleural fluid ___: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with metastatic papillary serous 
ovarian CA who was transferred from ___ with SBO. She had 
exp laparotomy on ___ where a perforated transverse colon was 
found; a R extended hemicolectomy and end ileostomy was 
performed, with L colon no longer in continuity with GI tract. 
This surgery was reported to be uneventful with minimal blood 
loss but some intra-peritoneal intra-peritoneal spillage. She 
was transferred to ICU for post-op monitoring given severity of 
comorbidities.
.
Given the concern for intraoperative spillage, she was started 
on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Fluconazole for planned five day course 
(day ___ this was broadened to Vancomycin, Meropenem, 
Ciprofloxacin and Fluconazole (day ___ when she was found to 
have developed a concomitant pneumonia. Her pain was treated 
with a Dilaudid PCA and she was kept NPO with TPN post-surgery. 
She was also continued on IV Bblocker and IV PPI post surgery.
.
The patient remained hypoxic after her surgery, with high 
supplemental oxygen need, thought to be due to splinting from 
abdominal pain as well as pneumonia; she was treated with 
antibiotics as above. She initially had acute renal failure with 
poor urine output but this improved with volume resuscitation. 
.
This patient has known metastatic ovarian cancer and was on 
weekly Avastin/Taxol prior to GI perforation. She was given one 
dose of neupagen on ___ after surgery; this was stopped after 
discussing with Gyn/Onc. Gyn/Onc will further direct her 
oncologic treatment, with social work and pastoral care 
following. 
.
Patient was transferred to the floor on ___ after oxygen 
requirement was tapered to 6L. Patient was diuresed with IV 
lasix and TPN was halved. She was advanced from clear liquids to 
regular diet over the following two days with TPN discontinued. 
Patient's ostomy showed normal outputs with appropriate gas. On 
___, the superior pole of the abdominal incision was noted 
to be erythematous with clear drainage. 3 staples were removed, 
cultures sent, and wound was packed. Gram stain showed no 
organisms. Wound was monitored and anitbiotics continued. Given 
the appearance of the wound and persistent elevated EBC count, 
CT abdomen was performed to assess for abdominal fluid 
collection which revealed a small anterior fluid collection in 
the superior abdomen. ___ was consulted but the collection was 
too small to drain. Follow up CT scans were performed to see 
progression of collection with gradual resolution noted on 
imaging. Over the next several days, superior abdominal wound 
opened further with fascial dehiscence noted in wound and 
drainage of purulent fluid. Wound was packed with aquacel and 
drainage decreased over time. 

As wound improved, persistent leukocytosis raised concern for 
cdiff colitis. Patient was started on empiric flagyl and a 
sigmoidoscopy was performed to assess remnant colon for 
pseudomembranes, with none seen. Flagyl was stopped once 3 cdiff 
cultures were negative. On ___, patient was complaining of 
significant muscle cramping, refractory to diazepam. One dose of 
tizanidine was given and patient was overly sedated. She was 
monitored closely with no change in respiratory function, though 
she was drowsy. Once tizanidine wore off, she was active with no 
mental slowing. Tizanidine was not given and diazepam was 
stopped.

On ___, patient reported severe dyspnea and tachycardia and a 
CTA chest was performed to rule out PE. Scan was negative and 
patient's dyspnea was releived with nebulizer treatments and 
supplemental oxygen. A similar episode occured on ___, and a 
repeat CTA chest was performed in light of patient's high risk 
due to cancer, and immbolization. Repeat scan was also negative. 
On ___, interventional pulmonology was consulted for 
therapeutic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in hopes of 
improving patient's dyspnea. 400 cc of seroud fluid was drained, 
with no bacterial growth, and chemistries consistent with 
transudate. Her dyspnea improved significantly after this, 
though she occasionally had episodes of dyspnea and tachycardia, 
presumably from anxiety.

Over the next ___ days, patient's leukocytosis stabilized around 
16 and her oxygen requirement resolved. She worked with physical 
therapy and po intake was encourage. 
Calorie count revealed inadequate calories intake. Her nutrition 
was supplemented with ensure shakes. 

At discharge, pt felt well. She was discharged on hospital 
day#28/post-operative day #26 in stable condition: afebrile, 
able to eat regular food, under adequate pain control with oral 
medications, and ambulating with ___ and urinating without 
difficulty.

Discharge Instructions:
___ were admitted to the hospital after emergency surgery for 
your colon perforation from your ovarian cancer. ___ have 
recovered from this procedure well and ___ are now ready to 
finish your recovery in rehab. 

___ have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed 
with staples. This incision can be left open to air or covered 
with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become 
irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until 
your first post-operative visit at which time they can be 
removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please 
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if ___ develop a 
fever. Please call the office if ___ develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.  ___ may 
shower and let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel; do not rub.

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___ may 
gradually increase your activity as tolerated but avoid heavy 
exercise. 

___ may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take 
more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while 
taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive 
a car while taking narcotic pain medication.

___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a 
new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the 
stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is 
very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large 
intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed 
into the body and the stool becomes formed. ___ must measure 
your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from 
the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If 
___ find that your output has become too much or too little, 
please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse 
practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the 
ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated. If ___ notice 
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink 
such as gatoraide. Please monitor yourself for signs and 
symptoms of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon 
standing), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If ___ 
notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the 
emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ 
may eat a modified regular diet with your new ileostomy.

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care 
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ stoma 
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be 
beefy red or pink. It may ooze small amounts of blood at times 
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around 
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the 
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed 
above. Please care for the ostomy as ___ have been instructed by 
the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ will be able to make an appointment 
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic after surgery. ___ will have 
nurses at rehab for the next few weeks helping to monitor your 
ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own.

Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual 
activities. Good luck!
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 58-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. She had a history of recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer and had undergone multiple surgeries and chemotherapy treatments. She was initially diagnosed with stage IIC ovarian cancer and had received carboplatin and Taxol therapy until she developed a carboplatin allergy. She was then switched to Doxil and later started on Arimidex. She had been stable until she developed abdominal pain, concern for acute appendicitis, and underwent laparoscopic evaluation, which revealed several carcinoma implants along both hemidiaphragms, the right lobe of the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and appendix.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy and end ileostomy. She was found to have small bowel pneumatosis and was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for sepsis. She was also found to have rising CA-125 levels and was initiated on carboplatin therapy. However, she developed a carboplatin allergy and was switched to Doxil.

The patient's past medical history is significant for recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer, osteopenia, and a family history of CAD and ovarian cancer. Her physical exam revealed abdominal tenderness, absent bowel sounds, and a Foley catheter in place draining clear urine.

The patient's discharge medications included vanc/zosyn, and her discharge labs showed elevated WBC count, AST, and ALT levels. Her imaging studies revealed a partially rim-enhancing fluid collection within the anterior midline abdomen, no findings of bowel obstruction or leak, and bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.

In summary, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer who underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy and end ileostomy due to abdominal pain and concern for acute appendicitis. She was found to have small bowel pneumatosis and was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for sepsis. She was also found to have rising CA-125 levels and was initiated on carboplatin therapy, but developed a carboplatin allergy and was switched to Doxil. ||endoftext||"

condition, then transferred to the ward for observation. 

Post-operatively, the patient remained afebrile with stable 
vital signs; pain was well controlled oral pain medication on a 
PRN basis.  The patient remained stable from both a 
cardiovascular and pulmonary standpoint. She was placed on 
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl while hospitalized, 
switched to oral antibiotics on POD 4 and discharged with broad 
spectrum oral antibiotics. Her intake and output were closely 
monitored and noted to be adequate. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin throughout admission; early and frequent 
ambulation were strongly encouraged while minimizing 
weightbearing to her L foot. She was evaluated by physical 
therapy who recommended working with the patient for ___ more 
sessions prior to discharge. Physical therapy deemed her safe to 
return home with her current weightbearing status. Following 
flushing her wound and skin prep with betadine, her incision 
site to her L foot was closed at bedside on ___. Upon 
discharge, she was seen at the podiatric surgery clinic where 
she was placed in a total contact cast. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Admission CXR:
IMPRESSION: 
Stable appearance of the chest with prominent right 
cardiophrenic fat pad, 
likely accounting for right paracardiac density. If there is 
strong clinical concern for intrathoracic abnormality, 
correlation with CT may be performed. 
<br>
CT Head ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. If clinical concern for acute ischemic event, MRI could be 
performed for
further characterization.
<br>
KUB:
FINDINGS: Three AP radiographs of the abdomen show a normal 
bowel gas pattern
no free air under the diaphragms or colonic dilatation. 
Atherosclerotic
vascular calcification is diffuse. Degenerative changes are seen 
in the
lumbar spine as well as in both hip joints, more severely on the 
left than on the right.
<br>
RLE Dopplers: IMPRESSION: No DVT.
<br>
EEG:
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to the occasional 
bursts of
generalized theta slowing. This is a non-specific finding but 
implies
the possibility of a dysfunction in midline structures. 
Medications are
one possible cause, but the background was remarkably normal at 
most
times. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there 
were
no epileptiform features.
<br>
EKG:
Baseline artifact
Rhythm is probably atrial fibrillation but baseline artifact 
makes assessment difficult
Early precordial QRS transition
Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities
These findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is 
suggested
Since previous tracing of ___, further ST-T wave changes 
present
<br>
MRI head/MRA neck:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable mild chronic small vessel ischemic changes. Stable 
moderate
diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
2. No evidence for acute infarction or hemorrhage.
3. Unremarkable MRA of the Neck.
<br>
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Cystic lesion in right cardiophrenic angle, probably 
pericardial cyst, but suggest 3 month chest CT follow-up.
2. No evidence of abscess or neoplasm.
<br>
Lumbar Puncture:
WBC, CSF 0 #/uL  CLEAR AND COLORLESS

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. M with asthma, ckd, dm, HTN, ataxia, falls, significant 
rapidly progressive dementia, who presents from NH again with 
agitation, anger and combative behavior originally in 4 point 
restraints now improved with 1 mg haldol and reassurance.  On 
admission, due to the striking rapidity of the progression of 
pt's dementia and current level of alteration of mental status, 
further work up of patient's condition was deemed necessary to 
rule out potentially reversible causes.  Pt was considered to 
have encephalopathy superimposed on his dementia.
.
1.  Delirium/Biswanger Disease/Agitation and Anger:Psychiatry 
was consulted on admission to assist with behavioral 
psychopharmacologic management, at which time recommendations 
were made for Seroquel BID, if patient would take po 
medications.  Neurology was consulted to assist with further 
work up of patient's rapidly progressive condition.  Significant 
workup was undertaken to evaluate for conditions potentially 
contribute to patient's encephalopathy.  
<br>
Patient was noted to have mild acute renal failure on admission, 
which improved with IVF.
<br>
Pt was noted to have wild behavioral swings, at times polite and 
complacent (although clearly confused, possibly hallucinating, 
and talking nonsensically), and at other times angry, agitated, 
and throwing items in the room without provocation.  Pt was 
often redirectable, unless severely escalated.  At one point, a 
""code purple"" was called, and required the assistance of 
security for the administration of 17.5 mg of IM Zyprexa, which 
had significant benefit.  Patient's seroquel was increased to 
scheduled 50 mg po TID.  Trileptal was later added as a mood 
stabilizer per Neuro recommendations.
<br>
Patient was noted to have some pain in a R upper tooth, which 
appeared slightly inflammed and painful.  Patient was started on 
Clindamycin po for tooth infection, although this was not 
thought to be related to patient's altered mental status.
<br>
Workup of patient's encephalopathy and rapidly progressive 
dementia included laboratory work for metabolic derangements, 
EEG, MRI head, MRA head, CT chest/abd/pelvis (to assess for 
malignancy/paraneoplastic syndrome or occult infection), and 
lumbar puncture, all of which were negative.  the only 
outstanding test was a CSF ___ protein to look for 
___ disease.  There is no treatment for that however 
and the results will not change his management.
<br>
2. HTN: Continued amlodipine and imdur.  Irbesartan held 
initially for ARF.  Will be restarted at discharge,
<br>
3. Hyperliipidemia:  Stable on ___
<br>
4. Type 2 DM:  Patient was on glyburide bid and pioglitazone at 
home.  These were held at admission.  His sugars within the 
hospital remained within a normal range without medications.  
Reintroduction of these meds can be considered at a later date 
if his sugars are found to be elevated again.
<br>
5. Groin wounds:  Given criticare with petroleum and nystatin 
bid.  Wound care consulted and followed the patient.
<br>
6. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Improved with IVF
<br>
7. Code: DNR/DNI.  D/w wife.

8. Disposition: Patient will be transferred to ___ for 
___ care.

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital due to mental status changes, failure to thrive, and a history of agitation and aggression. He has a past medical history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, asthma, and chronic kidney disease. He was previously admitted to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) for similar symptoms and was discharged with a diagnosis of mild cognitive delay and confusion over his disposition. He was readmitted to the hospital after being transferred from the SNF, where he was found to have an excoriated red rash and a stage I coccygeal ulcer. He was given miconazole powder and haldol 1 mg IV in the emergency department.

The patient's physical examination revealed an elderly obese male who was alert and hypervigilant, but clearly delirious. His mental status was impaired, and he was unable to give a coherent history. His neurological examination was normal, except for increased tone and jerks in his left upper extremity.

The patient's laboratory results showed a normal complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and renal function tests. His urine analysis showed a specific gravity of 1.020, and his blood glucose level was 159 mg/dL. His electroencephalogram (EEG) was mildly abnormal, showing occasional bursts of generalized theta slowing.

The patient underwent a lumbar puncture, which showed a clear and colorless cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with no white blood cells, red blood cells, or protein. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck showed stable mild chronic small vessel ischemic changes and moderate diffuse parenchymal volume loss.

The patient was diagnosed with dementia, likely due to his rapid progression of cognitive decline. He was treated with haldol and reassurance, and his agitation and aggression improved. He was discharged from the hospital with a plan for further management and follow-up. ||endoftext||"

IMAGES
===============
ANKLE ___

IMPRESSION: 
No signs for acute bony injury or bony destruction. If there is 
high clinical concern for septic joint, MRI imaging is 
recommended. There is swelling along the left ankle greater than 
that of the right side. 
.

KNEE ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large left-sided joint effusion. No acute fracture is seen. 
2. Tricompartmental osteophyte formation, chondrocalcinosis and 
multilateral compartment narrowing, the combination of findings 
can be seen in the setting of CPPD arthropathy. 
  

.
ECHO ___
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45% to 
50% ). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular 
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation 
is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There 
is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. 
Normal regional and global biventricular systolic function. The 
valves are well seen without significant regurgitation making 
endocarditis unlikely.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D 
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar. Overall ejection fraction is similar

___ 08:50AM BLOOD Cyclspr-___SSESSMENT/PLAN:
___ man with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p 
autologous SCT ___, secondary AML s/p allogous SCT in ___ 
(day +34) and CKD Stage III admitted with fever and coagulase 
negative staph isolated from blood cultures ___ which was 
determined to be a contaminant. He underwent knee aspiration and 
was found to have pseudogout.
.
# Bacteremia: Patient with low grade fevers at home and gram 
positive cocci isolated from ___ bottles drawn ___ from 
___'s catheter. He was treated with vancomycin IV on 
admission. ___'s catheter was pulled and culture of the tip 
was negative. He developed acute onset left knee pain on 
hospital day 2, the knee was warm and markedly swollen, left 
ankle swelling was also noted. Concern for septic arthritis was 
raised. Rehumatology was consulted who performed arthrocentisis 
which showed WBC 47K and calcium pyrophosphate crystals. 
According to rheumatology, calcium pyrophosphate chrystals can 
be seen in both pseudo gout and in septic arthritis. Given 
concurrent immunosupresant therapy, and rising peripheral 
leukocytosis in the setting of positive blood cultures, concern 
was raised for septic arthritis. Culture of the fluid was 
negative though he was on vancomycin at the time which may have 
sterilized the culture.  He was taken to the operating room with 
orthopedics and underwent washout of his left knee and ankle. 
Operative cultures showed no growth x 48 hours. Given 
involvement of multiple joints, concern for endocarditis was 
raised, TTE showed no valvular abnormalities or vegitations. ID 
was consulted, blood culture from ___ was speciated as coag 
negative staph. After discussion with ID, it was determined that 
the coag negative staph was a contaminant and vancomycin was 
discontinued. He remained afebrile x 48 hours off of 
antibiotics. Surveillance cultures were drawn and were negative, 
(there were two cultures which were pending at the time of 
discharge). He will need to keep the staples (knee) and sutures 
(left ankle) in place until two week follow up appointment with 
Dr. ___ in Ortho ___. He was given a limited 
prescription for oxycodone for pain on discharge.  
.
# Pseudogout: As above, patient developed swollen, red knee on 
hospital day 2, it was aspirated showing calcium pyrophosphate 
chrystals consistent with pseudogout. He developed bilateral 
ankle swelling and pain also related to pseudogout. After 
infeciton was ruled out, he was started on prednisone 20mg and 
will taper as below. He will need to follow up with rheumatology 
in ___ weeks.
___ start prednisone 15mg PO daily
___ start prednisone 10mg PO daily
___ start prednisone 5mg PO daily
___ discontinue prednisone
.
# Dysuria: patient complained of long standing dysuria, improved 
since starting Phenazopyridine prior to admission. UA was 
negative, urine culture negative. BK virus was negative. He was 
treated with phenazopyridine and his symptoms resolved.
.
# Thrush: patient complained of dysphagia and was found to have 
thrush. He was started on nystatin and will need to continue x 
14 days.

.
# Rash: Hyperpigmented patch overlying axillae ___ with central 
hypopigmentation was noted on exam. Per outpatient records, this 
had been present for weeks and improving. It did not appear to 
be cellulitis. Possibly contact dermatitis, according to the 
patient it was resolving after stopping antiperspirant.

.
# Left Shoulder pain: Patient with chronic pain affecting back 
and shoulders, it has previously been poorly controlled with 
fentanyl and lidocaine. On admission, he reported dramatic 
improvement in pain since starting cyclobenzaprine. Shoulder 
pain episodically flared throughout hospital stay however it was 
not warm, red or swollen and suspicion for septic arthritis 
involving the shoulder was low. Continued 
fentanyl/cyclobenzaprine/lidocaine patch. 
.
# Stage III chronic kidney disease: Creatinine has worsened over 
the weeks prior to admission weeks from 1.1 to a peak of 1.6. 
Bactrim and acyclovir had been held to reduce nephrotoxic 
burden. Creatinine trended up 1.4 to 1.6 after vancomycin at the 
time of discharge, it had trended down to 1.4.
.
# AML/MDS: Patient s/p allogous SCT ___, he was admitted on 
day +___. Cyclosporine levels were elevated and the dose was 
decreased to cyclosporine 100mg QAM, 125mg QPM. Fluconazole was 
changed to 200mg daily. Acyclovir and bactrim were on hold due 
to renal failure. He was treated with pentamidine inhaled x1 on

medications he is taking. It is mostly in his ___ toe on his 
left
foot. It has made it hard to get up and ambulate. He has been
slower on his feet. With that pain his family says he has had
increased agitation and confusion. They are also concerned
because he has been more forgetful and had one episode of 
urinary
incontinence. He has had no numbness, tingling in his
extremities. His family reports his PCP thought he had a stroke
about 4 months ago because it became hard for him to grip things
on the right side. He has had no increased weakness in his

IMAGING
=======
___ CTA HEAD AND NECK
1. Subcortical and periventricular areas of low attenuation
remain grossly unchanged, likely consistent with a combination 
of
chronic microvascular ischemic disease and lacunar ischemic
changes. 2. Acute on chronic ischemic changes cannot be
completely excluded, and in comparison with the most recent MRI
of the head, the subcortical area of subacute ischemia in the
right periventricular region is not clearly seen in the current
exam. 3. There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Unchanged left frontal convexity arachnoid cyst. 5. The CTA a
of the head is unremarkable with no evidence of flow stenotic
lesions or aneurysms. 6. The neck vessels are notable for 30% of
stenosis by NASCET criteria at the right cervical bifurcation
with a combination of soft and calcified plaques. 
Atherosclerotic
changes causes approximately 25 of narrowing at the left 
cervical
carotid bifurcation by NASCET criteria as described in detail
above 7. Arteriosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic
arch, and origin of the left subclavian artery, and both
vertebral arteries. 

___: ANGIOGRAM FINDINGS: 
1. Left lower extremity angiogram demonstrating widely patent
left common femoral artery as well as widely patent left SFA and
profunda femoris, the above-knee and below-knee popliteal
arteries appear widely patent as well. At the tibial station,
there are two major runoff vessels to the foot in the form of 
the
left anterior tibial artery and the left posterior tibial 
artery.
The left posterior tibial artery has a short segment stenosis
proximally as well as a short mid segment occlusion and the left
anterior tibial artery has a distal segment occlusion. Both of
these were able to angioplasty both the proximal left ___ segment
as well as the distal left anterior tibial artery segment and 
the
peroneal artery appears diffusely diseased at the tibial 
station.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ hx DMII, HTN, foot ulcers, PVD (last intervention 
___ on ASA/Plavix), pulmonary HTN, CKD who presented to the ED 
with encephalopathy and left foot pain. He was found to have dry 
gangrene of his left ___ toe and is now s/p angioplasty of his 
left lower extremity. 

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#Left foot dry gangrene 
#PVD 
#Aortic Thrombus 
The patient presented with left foot/toe pain and was found to 
have dry gangrene of his ___ toe. This was thought to be 
secondary to his extensive peripheral vascular disease and an 
aortic thrombus shattering clot. The patient was initially 
started on vancomycin, but this was discontinued upon admission 
to the medicine floor given low concern for infection or wet 
gangrene. The patient underwent ABI/PVRs on ___ per vascular 
surgery recommendations. He ultimately underwent angiography of 
lower extremity with successful balloon angioplasty of the 
proximal left posterior tibial artery as well as the distal left 
anterior tibial artery with vascular surgery. Vascular surgery 
determined that his aortic thrombus was mostly intramural and 
did not require systemic anticoagulation. Given this, the 
patient was continued on DAPT with ASA and Plavix. Podiatry was 
also consulted and is now planning for outpatient surgical 
intervention. Given his extensive PVD and other medical history, 
his home lovastatin was switched to high dose atorvastatin. As 
detailed below, Neurology was also consulted for recommendations 
regarding anticoagulation and DAPT given micro hemorrhages seen 
on his MRI. They ultimately agree with continuing DAPT. 

___ on CKD, 
The patient's Cr initially went from 1.2 to 1.5 after getting a 
CTA of the head and neck. Of note, the patient was noted to have 
eosinophilia on his differential and that the etiology was 
thought to be related to is possible that this was related to 
hypovolemia vs. contrast vs. AIN (given eosinophilia). 
Reassuringly, he was not on any drugs that are classically 
associated with AIN. The patient's Cr trended up on again on 
___ and his home chlorthalidone was discontinued and he 
received another 1L IVF bolus. His creatinine remained mildly 
elevated to 1.3 on the day of discharge so his home 
chlorthalidone continued to be held. The patient will have labs 
drawn on ___ and will follow up with his PCP ___ ___ at which 
time they can discuss resuming chlorthalidone. 

#Encephalopathy 
#Micro hemorrhages on MRI 
Per the patient's family, he has had a progressive decline in 
mental status dating back until at least ___. An outpatient 
MRI obtained by the patient's PCP showed extensive lacunar 
infarcts and possible amyloid involvement. On admission his 
toxicology screen was negative. On exam he had no focal 
deficits. A repeat MRI continued to demonstrate micro 
hemorrhages and subacute as well as chronic lunar infarcts. 
Neurology was consulted and their final assessment concluded 
that there were no neurologic contraindication to ASA an Plavix, 
but to avoid DAPT in addition to chronic anticoagulation. He was 
arranged for up with neurology and neuro cognitive clinic as an 
outpatient. 

#HTN - Held chlorthalidone 25 daily given ___ as noted above. He 
was continued on metoprolol 50 mg daily 

#Diabetes - The patient's home metformin were held and he was 
continued on a sliding scale insulin. 

#BPH - Continued home Tamsulosin 0.4 mg QHS 

#Depression - Continued home BuPROPion XL (Once Daily) 300 mg PO 
DAILY

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of toe pain. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, foot ulcers, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), pulmonary hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was previously treated with ASA/Plavix for PVD. The patient's symptoms started two weeks ago and have not changed much over that time. He has been experiencing pain in his left toe, which has made it difficult for him to get up and ambulate. He has also been experiencing increased agitation and confusion, as well as urinary incontinence.

The patient underwent a left lower extremity angiogram with angioplasty of the proximal left posterior tibial artery, mid left posterior tibial artery, and left anterior tibial artery. He was found to have dry gangrene of his left toe, which was thought to be secondary to his extensive PVD and an aortic thrombus.

The patient was started on vancomycin, but it was discontinued upon admission to the medicine floor given low concern for infection or wet gangrene. He was continued on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ASA and Plavix. Podiatry was consulted and is planning for outpatient surgical intervention. The patient's home lovastatin was switched to high-dose atorvastatin due to his extensive PVD and other medical history.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated blood glucose, urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. His imaging studies showed atherosclerotic changes in the neck vessels and aortic arch, as well as a short segment stenosis and occlusion in the left posterior tibial artery.

The patient's hospital course was complicated by dry gangrene of his left toe, PVD, and an aortic thrombus. He underwent successful balloon angioplasty of the proximal left posterior tibial artery and distal left anterior tibial artery. He was continued on DAPT and was discharged with plans for outpatient surgical intervention and continued management of his medical conditions. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F who initially presented from assisted 
living to ___ with chest pain. Cardiac work up was 
unremarkable. CT scan showed evicence of cholecystitis and she 
was given IV zosyn. The following morning she had an elevated 
heart rate, increased pain, and increased distention. Repeat CT 
scan showed development of emphysematous gallbladder and she was 
transferred to ___ on ___ with stable vital signs. 
Surgery was discussed with the patient, husband, and health care 
proxy (son). Informed consent was obtained and she was taken to 
the operating room urgently for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 
Intra-operative cholangiogram was preformed and negative for 
obstruction. Post operatively she remained intubated and was 
transferred to the ICU. 

ICU Course:
On POD0 she remained intubated and hemodynamically stable. On 
POD2 she was extubed without difficulty to nasal canula and then 
weaned to room air. Foley catheter was removed and she voided 
spontaneously adequate urine. Liver function and total bilirubin 
continued to trend down. Required 250 ml albumin for low urine 
output. On POD4 she was transferred to the floor. 

Floor Course:

On POD2 the patient was hemodynamically stable and transferred 
to the surgical floor for further management. She tolerated a 
regular diet and converted or oral pain medication with 
continued good effect. The patient continued to void without 
problem. Intake and output were monitored. She was given 
laxative for constipation. Physical therapy evaluated her 
mobility and recommended discharge to acute rehab. Respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry were encouraged and the patient 
and family actively participated in the plan of care. The 
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were 
used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding adequate urine, and 
pain was well controlled. The patient was discharged to acute 
rehab. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up

active work-up for abdominal pain, frequent falls before leaving 
AMA re-presenting after call in for eval after urine culture 
that admission was positive.  
 Patient reports since discharge on ___, he has had a number of 
health complaints including recent nausea, subjective fever, 
vomiting over the last 5 days. Patient reports being in ___ ED 
for nose bleed on ___. He also reports presenting to his PCP 
for malaise yesterday, but is unclear about diagnosis or 
treatment, but recalls a temperature of 100. He does endorse 
drinking alcohol on day of admission.  
 Patient also endorses 2 episodes of falling. The first was 
about a week ago. He reports walking from the post office and 
feeling palpitations, lightheaded and weak in his legs. He fell 
and feels that he lost consciousness. He denies tongue biting, 
but endorses fecal incontinence. A witness that saw him said his 
eyes were rolling back in his head at the time. He was admitted 
to ___ for this on ___ where he was intoxicated w/ positive 
EtOH level. He left AMA after refusing orthostatics and EEG. His 
tele did not demonstrate any events, TSH and B12 were normal.

___ MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST
No acute infarct.  Relatively mild periventricular subcortical 
white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities which are likely sequela 
of chronic small vessel disease.  Global volume loss.  
Nonspecific right occipital scalp soft tissue lesion visualized 
back to ___. 

___ CT ABD/PEL W/O CONTRAST
1. No evidence of perirenal abscess or collection. Mild 
thickening of the 
proximal left ureter suggests mild underlying pyelitis. 
2. Status post cystectomy and ileal conduit, with postsurgical 
changes 
detailed above. 
3. Dysmorphic appearing liver compatible with the known 
underlying cirrhosis, with trace free fluid in the right upper 
quadrant. 

___ AXR
Nonspecific nonobstructive bowel gas pattern most suggestive of 
ileus.
___ AXR
No abnormally dilated loops of large or small bowel.

___ LENIs
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower 
extremity veins.

___ RUQ Doppler US
1. Patent hepatic vasculature.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with a history of decompensated HCV, etOH 
cirrhosis w/ grade I varices/PHG, ascites, bladder/prostate 
cancer s/p resection and ileal conduit (___), CAD s/p MI, 
CKD-III, multiple admissions for hematochezia/hematuria, 
frequent falls presenting with UTI with MDR Klebsiella and VRE 
s/p abx, now with persistent urostomy bloody output, transferred 
to MICU for hypotension. He underwent a TIPS procedure and ___ 
sclerosis of the para stomal varices. After the TIPS procedure, 
Mr. ___ was somewhat encephalopathic; this improved with 
lactulose and rifaximine. We hoped to medically optimize him 
before discharge, but he eloped on the morning of ___. He 
returned to the hospital on the afternoon of the same day, had 
his PICC line removed and picked up his new prescriptions.

#Urostomy Bleed, Ileal varices: Frank blood in ileal conduit 
causing hypotension. CT portal-venous study shows varices from 
patients cirrhotic liver disease are likely source of bleeding. 
He required MICU transfer for bleed and hypotension after 
receiving pRBC. After ___ embolization and TIPs procedure, 
bleeding resolved.

#Melena: Resolved. EGD ___ showing small varices and portal 
hypertension and hypertensive gastropathy. Colonoscopy ___ 
showing portal colopathy. Suspect ongoing slow GI bleed in 
setting of thrombocytopenia. Medically optimize with max dose 
PPI and sucralfate.  

#Normocytic anemia: Patient has normocytic anemia at baseline 
prior to variceal bleed. Being followed by hematology-oncology. 
Most likely ___ underproduction given low reticulocyte count. 
Marrow suppression is in turn is likely ___ prior UTI infection, 
medication-induced (e.g. linezolid). Anemia of chronic disease 
likely also contributing with etOH, HCV cirrhosis. Slow (prior 
to variceal bleed) GI loss from portal gastropathy and 
colonopathy may have also been contributing. Manage variceal 
bleed as detailed above. Patient was seen by heme/onc and had BM 
biopsy with flow cytometry which showed no evidence of leukemia.

#Thrombocytopenia: Baseline plt counts appear to be ~100-150 
with nadir this admission to low of 14. Has rec'd 4u plt's this 
admission due to ongoing bleeding as above. He has multiple risk 
factors for thrombocytopenia including infection, alcohol use, 
liver disease with splenomegaly and antibiotic exposure. No 
evidence of intravascular hemolysis currently as discussed 
above, making DIC or TTP less likely. HIV AB was negative this 
admission. Peripheral blood smear was relatively normal however 
did have an increase in the number of large granular 
lymphocytes. ITP also cannot be ruled out. Finally HIT is 
possible with 4T score of 4 however no evidence of thrombosis 
and last heparin exposure was ___ without subsequent 
improvement in plt counts.  HIT antibody which resulted at 0.49. 
Heparin was held; serotonin release assay was negative.

# CIRRHOSIS: MELD baseline ___, Childs ___ B, secondary to 
etOH and HCV. Per patient he received four pills to treat HCV at 
one time, not clear if infection was fully treated. Repeat EGD 
this admission showed small varices, not amenable to banding, 
colonoscopy without significant rectal varices. However, concern 
for varices of ileal conduit as above.

# URINARY TRACT INFECTION, WITH MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT KLEBSIELLA 
& VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCUS: found on urine culture from 
previous ED visit. CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrating mild 
pyelitis. IV linezolid started on ___ IV cefepime started on 
___ ___ompleted ___. Was on IV vancomycin from 
___, until sensitivities returned at which point vanc was 
discontinued.  

# CHRONIC PAIN: in abdomen and L hip. He has had extensive work 
ups for both of these without clear etiology. No fracture on hip 
XR in ___. He chronically takes oxycodone for his pain. 
Multiple providers have expressed concerns for drug seeking 
behavior. During his hospital course, he had progressively 
worsening abdominal pain, which was controlled with PRN IV 
dilaudid.

# HISTORY OF BLADDER/PROSTATE CANCER: s/p resection and ileal 
conduit in ___ and nephrostomy placed ___ unilateral 
stricture, per ___ team at ___. Anticipate long term 
need. No radiation or chemotherapy.  Will follow with urologist, 
___, at ___  

#ETOH ABUSE: Long history of alcohol abuse complicated by 
alcoholic cirrhosis. Had no signs of withdrawal and did not 
score on CIWA for 72 hours. He only endorses 3 drinks in past 
week prior to admission.  Thiamine, folate, social work consult 

#HYPERTENSION: held home lisinopril in setting of hypotension.
 
# GERD: On BID PPI given active GIB as above

# ASTHMA: asymptomatic. Albuterol PRN 

***Transitional Issues
#Cirrhosis: Patient has an appointment in the ___. ___ 
benefit from restarting Lasix/spironolactone as an outpatient. 
Left before medical optimization. 

#CAD: Patient had CP that responded to nitroglycerin I/s/o 
profound anemia, w/out troponin bumps or EKG changes. Would 
encourage medical optimization with ASA, statin, beta blocker as 
an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure to take care of you at ___. You were 
admitted for a urinary tract infection affecting your surgical 
bladder. The bacteria causing the infection are strong and 
resistant to most antibiotics, so you required strong 
antibiotics through the IV. You completed a full 10 day course 
of Linezolid and Cefipime.

While you were here, you developed a problem with bleeding. 
First you were bleeding from your gut. We think this is because 
your platelets (a part of your blood that stops bleeding) were 
very low, and because of your liver disease. Later, you 
developed bleeding from your stoma. You needed several 
transfusions, because your blood counts were low. You were 
transferred to the intensive care unit, where they made a new 
path for blood to flow from your gut back to your heart without 
passing through your liver, lowering the pressure in your 
vessels, and a procedure to scar down the bleeding vessels 
themselves. After this your bleeding resolved.

You also developed some confusion while you were here. We think 
this is because you liver is not able to clear toxins from your 
blood as effectively anymore. For this confusion, it is very 
important that you continue to take lactulose and rifaximin.

Unfortunately, you left the hospital premises before you could 
be safely discharged and given any of this information. We 
called you and asked you to come back to the hospital but you 
refused. We re-inforced the need for you to seek medical care. 
You then hung-up the phone on us. 

We wish you all the best going forward. 

Sincerely,

Your medical team at ___

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for rsurgical 
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken  to the 
Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass 
grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for detail. 
 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
 POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Foley re-placed for urinary retention and Flomax 
initiated.   Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  He had a brief burst of AFib which 
converted to SR with Lopressor.  The patient was evaluated by 
the Physical Therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  He became orthostatic following simultaneous dosing 
of Lopressor, Lasix and Imdur. Doses staggered the following day 
and the patient tolerated well. AFib returned.  Xarelto 
initiated for anti-coagulation.   By the time of discharge on 
POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing 
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was 
discharged home in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.

IMAGING
==============================
CT C-spine ___ IMPRESSION: 
1. Limited examination due to motion artifact.  Exam is non 
diagnostic at the C2-3 and C4-5 through C5-6 levels.  Apparent 
anterolisthesis of C5 on C6 is likely due to motion artifact.  
No visualized fracture. 
2. Extensive degenerative changes most severe at C3-4 and C4-5. 

CT sinus/mandible ___
IMPRESSION:  Right periorbital hematoma without underlying 
fracture.  Possible tiny component of hemorrhage the postseptal 
region abutting the lacrimal gland without mass effect. 

CT-pelvis ___  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of acute fracture.  Apparent cortical step-off of 
the left 
proximal femoral diaphysis on sagittal images is thought to be 
motion artifact rather than true fracture.  No evidence of soft 
tissue hematoma. 
2. No free fluid or fluid collections in the pelvis. 
3. Underdistended urinary bladder, limits evaluation.  Several  
unchanged 
urinary bladder diverticula. 
4. Severe enlargement of the prostate gland. 

CXR ___ IMPRESSION:    
In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased 
opacification at the left base with silhouetting hemidiaphragm, 
consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss the left lower 
lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be 
impossible to exclude the possibility of superimposed pneumonia 
left great. 
No evidence of vascular congestion.  The remainder of the lungs 
is clear.  
Dual channel pacer device remains in place with leads extending 
to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. 

CXR ___ IMPRESSION:   
Left lower lobe consolidation is improving.  There is no 
significant pleural effusion. 

Renal US ___ IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally.  Bilateral renal 
cysts.  Note is made that the known small solid mass arising 
from the lower pole of the left kidney could not be visualized 
on today's portable bedside exam. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man who presented w/ R periorbital hematoma after a fall 
at home, found to have a UTI and likely CAP, with hospital 
course complicated by ___ ___ obstruction, hematuria.

#Leukocytosis: Peaked to 13.1 on ___ on last day of treatment 
for CAP and UTI. Unclear source as respiratory symptoms were 
improving, ___ resolving, follow-up blood cultures were 
negative, and patient remained afebrile. Downtrended to 10.1 on 
day of discharge.

___ retention: Cr spike to 2.8 on ___ after removal of 
foley ___. Immediate 1L urine output with foley replacement. 
Renal u/s showed no hydronephrosis. ___ FeUrea (34.5%)and FeNa 
(0.84%) were equivocal, suggesting that ___ may have been 
attributable to both post-renal obstruction and prerenal 
azotemia. Cr improved steadily with catheterization, and was 1.1 
on DC. Tamsulosin and finasteride were started. Foley will be 
continued on discharge as patient was unable to void 
spontaneously and straight cathing was complicated by blood at 
the urethral meatus. Patient should follow-up with urology for 
foley maintenance. 

#Atrial Fibrillation w/ h/o CVA x2: Rate-controlled, on 
warfarin, sub-therapeutic throughout admission. Given high 
Chads2 score, patient was bridged with enoxaparin, which should 
be continued until INR >2. Warfarin dose increased to 3 mg 
daily. INR 1.7 on discharge.

#S/p Fall at Home: Unclear precipitant of fall. No known LOC per 
hx from pt and wife. Possible mechanical fall i/s/o 
deconditioning. Orthostasis also possible factor given suspicion 
for active PNA at time of admission. Pt does have 
known afib with ICD, though ICD found to be functioning well 
without arrhythmia on EP evaluation during admission. ___ 
evaluated patient and determined him to be suitable for rehab.  

#GPR & GPC Bacteremia: Corynebacterium and coag-neg staph 
isolated from 1 bottle (___) over 5d,thought to be contaminant. 
Follow-up blood cultures negative. Patient hemodynamically 
stable throughout admission; fever to 100.5 on ___ likely 
attributable to CAP.

___ Hematoma: After fall at home, with periorbital 
laceration sutured in ED. Evaluated by ophtho in the ED, who 
determined no need for surgical intervention. Hematoma improved 
throughout admission, and patient did not experience visual 
changes. Sutures removed on ___. Patient should have 
ophthalmology follow-up as outpatient.

#Hypoactive Delirium: Stuttering mental status declines noted in 
OMR over past year. Prior CT head imaging notable for diffuse 
microvascular ischemia. Pt remained somewhat somnolent on exams, 
but as alert and oriented x2-3 when roused. 
Deliriogenic medications including ipratropium and cetirizine 
were d/c'd on ___. Per his daughter, patient often becomes 
altered during past hospitalizations. Daughter reported patient 
was at his mental status baseline on day of discharge.

#CAP vs. Aspiration Pneumonitis: Noted on ___ CXR after patient 
spiked fever to 100.5. Patient also had diffuse upper and lower 
airway wheezing, with intermittent dyspnea. Patient was treated 
with IV vancomycin (___), IV cefepime (___), IV unasyn 
(___), PO ampicillin (___) for a total of 7 days of 
antibiotics. Infiltrate noted to be improved without effusion on 
repeat ___ CXR. Blood cultures negative except for ___ blood 
culture growing GPR and coag-negative staph, thought to be a 
contaminant. 

#UTI: Urine cx (___) showed pan-sensitive proteus. As prior 
UA/Ucx prior to foley insertion was clean, may be ___ to foley 
insertion. Patient was treated with 7 days of antibiotics as 
above. Patient should have urology follow-up for indwelling 
foley. 

#Hematuria: Noted on admission after foley insertion, resolved 
initially 
with bladder irrigation. Mild hematuria without clots recurred 
after foley re-insertion prior to discharge, likely in the 
setting of traumatic foley and anticoagulation. Patient should 
follow-up with urology as above.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Dysphagia: Initial concern for aspiration based on nursing 
observation. Cleared by speech and swallow for thin liquid and 
pureed diet. Meds crushed and given in applesauce.

#Presumed RCC: Left lower pole renal mass modestly increased in 
size on last admission. Last seen by urology ___, 
recommended repeat CT in ___. Patient should follow-up 
with urology sooner than scheduled ___ appointment for 
maintenance of indwelling foley catheter.

#Hypertension:  Intermittently with HTN up to SBP 160s during 
admission. Home losartan held while patient had obstructive ___, 
but restarted prior to DC as ___ improved. Patient also started 
on amlodipine 5 mg daily - his daughter reported 
amlodipine not a home med, but refill history indicates 
prescription for amlodipine 10 mg daily.

#Coronary Artery Disease: Aspirin and statin continued. 
 
#Chronic diastolic heart failure (ECHO w/ LVEF >55% in ___, 
s/p ICD: Home Lasix was held during admission in the setting of 
active infection. Was euvolemic on exam on discharge, and 
patient maintained even fluid status according to I/Os. Lasix 
will be held on discharge, and daily weights and volume status 
should be monitored. 

#BPH: Finasteride and tamsulosin started during admission for 
urinary retention.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

[] Patient should follow-up with ophthalmology for his 
___ hematoma. 
[] Amlodipine 5 mg started during admission (unclear if was 
taking at home). Consider increasing if hypertensive.
[] Foley inserted during admission for obstructive ___ and 
subsequent inability to void. Consider trial of void to 
decrease risk of recurrent UTI. Patient should have urology 
follow-up.
[] Tamsulosin and finasteride started during admission for 
BPH/urinary retention.
[] Warfarin increased to 3 mg daily in the setting of 
subtherapeutic INRs.

not affected by your fall. 
-We treated you with antibiotic for pneumonia and a urinary 
tract infection.
-We put a foley catheter in because you had difficulty 
urinating.

What should I do when I return home?
-Please weigh yourself each day and call your doctor if your

 ","||startoftext|| The patient is an 85-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital after falling at home and presenting with a small laceration over his right eyelid and significant periorbital hematoma. He has a history of renal cell carcinoma, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and coronary artery disease. He is allergic to morphine. His past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, left eye blindness, and a pacemaker. He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and falls. He underwent a CT scan of the spine, which showed limited examination due to motion artifact. He was prescribed erythromycin eye drops and ciprofloxacin for his UTI. His medications at discharge included ciprofloxacin, erythromycin eye drops, and a foley catheter. ||endoftext||"

___ ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 
Right bundle-branch block. Prior anteroseptal myocardial 
infarction. No previous tracing available for comparison.  

___ ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with 
moderate to severe regional hypokinesis with severe hypokinesis 
of the distal ___ of the left ventricle (LVEF = 25 %). The 
basal segments contract best. The estimated cardiac index is 
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen ___ the 
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is 
moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8cm2). Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. An 
eccentric jet of mild to moderate [___] is seen directed the 
interatrial septum. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with 
extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or 
other diffuse process. Moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis. 
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. 

___ CXR: The cardiomegaly is severe, unchanged since prior 
study. There is overall improvement ___ pulmonary edema with 
still present residual opacities ___ the lower lobes that might 
represent residual of edema although atelectasis cannot be 
excluded. There is no appreciable pleural effusion although note 
is made that the left costophrenic angle was excluded from the 
field of view. The left PICC line catheter tip is ___ proximal 
SVC. 

___ RX STRESS TEST: INTERPRETATION: ___ yo man (h/o CAD, 
CHF and atrial fibrillation) was referred for evaluation prior 
to vascular surgery. The patient was administered 0.142 
mg/kg/min of persantine over 4 minutes. No chest, back, neck or 
arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the 
procedure. ___ the presence of baseline abnls and digoxin 
therapy, no 
additional ST-T segment changes were noted from baseline. The 
rhythm was atrial fibrillation with occasional isolated VPDs 
noted 
during the procedure. By doppler, the patient was hypertensive 
at 
baseline with an appropriate blood pressure response to the 
persantine 
infusion. Three min post-myoview, the patient received 125 mg 
aminophylline IV. IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or significant 
ECG changes from baseline. Nuclear report sent separately. 
NUCLEAR: INTERPRETATION:  The image quality is adequate but 
limited by motion. Left ventricular cavity size is dilated at 
stress and rest.   
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal fixed moderate/severe 
inferior and 
apical defects but otherwise uniform tracer uptake throughout 
the left 
ventricular myocardium.  Gated images could not be obtained due 
to atrial fibrillation.  IMPRESSION:  Fixed moderate to severe 
defect involving inferior wall and apex. Dilated LV at rest and 
stress.  

___ CXR: FINDINGS: There has been interval increase ___ 
pulmonary vascular congestion. Bibasilar atelectasis is 
unchanged. There is a very small right-sided pleural effusion. 
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinal contours are 
obscured by the overlying metalic body. A left PICC is seen 
projecting ___ good position, though its tip is obscured by the 
foreign body. There is a new right internal jugular Swan-Ganz 
catheter with tip ending ___ the main pulmonary artery. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval worsening ___ pulmonary vascular 
congestion. 2. New right IJ ___-Ganz catheter ending ___ the 
region of the main pulmonary artery. 

___ ECG: Atrial fibrillation, mean ventricular rate 94. 
Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of 
___ no major change. 

___ CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, 
the ___-___ catheter has been removed; however, the 
introduction sheath is still ___ place. There is a PICC line 
inserted over the left upper extremity, the tip of the PICC line 
projects over the mid SVC. As compared to the previous 
radiograph, there is slightly improved ventilation 
of the retrocardiac lung areas. Otherwise, the lungs are 
unremarkable and 
show no evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity 
potentially 
suggestive of pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly without signs of 
overhydration. No pleural effusions, no pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ Admitted
___ Right heel debridment.Transfered to ___ for rapid 
AF RVR and hypotension requiring Dilt gtt. and nep gtt. 
Cardology consulted.cardiac enzymes cycled.dig added to regment 
for rythmn control.cardiac enzymes CK ___, troponins 0.03-.04
___: ECHO obtained, results attached
___: Pt tested C. Diff positive
___: Dx angio performed showing limited options for 
revascularization.  Given pt's poor cardiac status, the pt was 
given the option of R BKA vs bypass with the understanding that 
BKA presented his best chances for early healing and ambulation 
and also provided less overall risk given his poor health.  Pt 
and family decided to pursue R BKA and he was medically managed 
to optimize pre-op cardiovascular status.
___: R foot debridement at bedside. Dilt drip weaned
___: Pre-op persantine stress test was performed and the 
decision was made with recommendation from Cardiology to 
postpone R BKA two days to achieve a further 2L diuresis.
___: Pt was taken to the OR after it was determined he was 
___ adequate condition from a cardiovascular standpoint. 
___ catheter & Brachial arterial line were placed by 
anesthesia and Femoral/Sciatic nerve block was administered.  R 
BKA was performed without complication.  Pt tolerated the 
procedure well and was transfered to the VICU postoperatively ___ 
stable condition.
___: Pt tolerated a regular Diabetic/Cardiac diet, pain 
was well controlled.
___: ___-___ catheter was removed
___: Pt fell on amputation site while getting OOB to Chair 
with ___.  Stump was evaluated serially and felt to be intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the 
gynecology service after undergoing and IV guided drainage of a 
tuboovarian abscess noted on her left adnexa. Please see the 
operative report for full details.

Her immediate post op course was complicated by low grade fevers 
on post-operative day 1 and 2 and IV antibiotics were broadened 
to include gentamycin, clindamycin, and ampicillin. On post-op 
day 2, patient had an elevated WBC with increasing left shift 
and repeat pelvic ultrasound and CT pelvis with contrast was 
performed. Imaging was notable for a decreased left adnexal 
fluid collection of 3cm (decreased from 6cm on admission) and a 
new right rim-enhancing 1.3cm and 0.9 collection on the right 
adnexa. Interventional radiology was re-consulted but given 
improvement of WBC count and clinical improvement, additional 
drainage deferred. On post-op day 3, she was transitioned to PO 
levofloxacin and metronidazole. Patient remained afebrile and 
felt subjectively improved. 

During her stay she was noted to have negative gonorrhea, 
chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and HIV tested. Tumor markers were 
noted to be within normal limits. The fluid drained from her 
left adnexal mass grew no microorganisms and urine cultures were 
negative. 

On post-operative day 3, she was voiding spontaneously, her diet 
was advanced without difficulty, and she was transitioned to 
oral pain medications and oral antibiotocs.She was then 
discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up 
scheduled.

thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: moderate to severe regional systolic dysfunction as 
described above. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Cannot 
determine pulmonary artery systolic pressure. 

EGD ___
Esophagus:  
Excavated Lesions A single non-bleeding localized erosion was 
noted in the gastroesophageal junction. This is ___ class 
III lesion with a rebleeding risk < 3%.

Stomach:  
Mucosa: Diffuse granularity and erythema of the mucosa were 
noted in the stomach. These findings are compatible with mild 
gastritis.  
Excavated Lesions A single superficial non-bleeding 2 mm erosion 
found in the antrum. This is ___ class III lesion with a 
rebleeding risk < 3%.   

Duodenum:  
Mucosa: Diffuse continuous granularity, erythema and nodularity 
of the mucosa were noted throughout the duodenum compatible with 
duodenitis.  
Flat Lesions Two medium angioectasias that were not bleeding 
were seen in the duodenal bulb. BI-CAP Electrocautery was 
applied for hemostasis successfully.  

Impression: Erosion in the gastroesophageal junction
Granularity and erythema in the stomach compatible with mild 
gastritis
Angioectasias in the duodenal bulb (thermal therapy)
Granularity, erythema and nodularity in the duodenum compatible 
with duodenitis
Gastric erosion
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 

Recommendations: 
High dose PPI twice a day
Repeat EGD in 8 weeks for evaluation of esophageal erosion 

Colonscopy (___):
IMPRESSION: 
Severe degree of diverticuli seen throughout sigmoid and 
descending colon. Several small venous blebs were seen in rectum 
which are unlikely a source of bleeding. No fresh or old blood 
seen. Poor prep was noted.
Small internal hemorrhoids.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Patient with extensive diverticuli but no active bleeding or 
old blood
- Followup with inpatient GI team
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o CAD and ischemic CMP s/p BMS x3 on plavix and ASA 81mg, 
paroxysmal AFib on warfarin, who p/w UGIB i/s/o INR of ___  s/p 
reversal with vitamin K and Kcentra and s/p EGD with ablation of 
AVMs, most recently with cardiac event i/s/o extubation. 
CHA2DS2-VASc score of 6 (high risk).

# UGIB: Reports of melanic diarrhea x weeks and coffee ground 
emesis x days suggests a chronic UGIB in the setting of 
supratherapeutic INR to ___ s/p Vit K 10mg IV and Kcentra. GIB is 
chronic in nature given prolonged symptoms. Initial H/H was 
___ in the ED, recieved 2 units of pRBCS, repeat H/H on ICU 
arrival was 8.4/24.4, unclear if lab error. INR was quickly 
reversed, 1.3. IV PPI ggt. Pt was electively intubated for EGD. 
EGD done by GI which showed erosions in esophagus and stomach, 
AVMs x2 in duodenum, and findings of old blood, no active 
bleeding. The AVMs were intervened upon to good effect with no 
further bleeding. Patient underwent a colonoscopy that showed 
severe degree of diverticuli throughout sigmoid and descending 
colon, several small venous blebs in the rectum which were not 
deemed to be a source of bleeding, and small internal 
hemorrhoids.

# Troponin Leak: After EGD, pt was extubated but was unable to 
maintain ventilation and developed hypotension - thought to be 
2/t oversedation. Labs during resp decompensation were 
significant for rising troponin. EKG did not show overt ST-T 
wave changes. Decision was made to reintubate. After intubation, 
pt entered into a ventricular escape rhythm. Bedside TTE did not 
show significant changes from previous EF of 30%. Was 
transiently on Levophed and DObutamine, EKG also retruned to 
baseline NSR with chronic LBBB. CVL placed. S/p 3unit of pRBCs 
for goal HCT of 30 and increasing troponin. Pt was quickly 
weaned from pressors. Troponins plateaued and were donwtrending 
prior to discharge from ICU. Formal TTE done the following day 
showed a stable EF of ___. Seen by Cardiology who attributed 
the increase in troponin to hypotension/demand ischemia given 
CAD and RCA occulsion supplied by collaterals.
 
# Anemia: Likely oozing or intermittently bleeding UGIB in 
setting of supratherapeutic INR given hematemesis and melena 
over multiple days with INR 14.5 on admission. Now s/p Kcentra 
x1, VitK 10mg IV x1, protonix loading, 2u pRBC. S/P EGD with 
ablation of 2 AVMs. Currently HDS with stable H/H. On discharge, 
H/H was 9.4/28.2.
 
# CAD: C/b ischemic CMP s/p BMS x3 a few month ago. Baseline 
LBBB. Continued Aspirin during UGIB. Plavix is no longer 
indicated given BMS over 6 weeks ago and this was stopped. 
Continued Atorvastatin. Metoprolol was held during UGIB.
 
# Paroxysmal Afib: On warfarin after recent admission with plan 
for outpt Holter to determine need for long term AC, 
supratherapeutic INR on arrival to ED s/p reversal, no evidence 
of afib during admission. Given UGIB, decision was made to stop 
Coumadin temporarily. She has a CHADS2 VASC of 5, resulting in 
decision to restart coumadin after bleed was controlled.

Transitional Issues:
-Will need repeat EGD to assess esophageal erosions for 
possibility of ___ esophagus in 8 weeks
-PPI PO BID on discharge
-Continue aspirin and coumadin

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old right handed ___ driver with an unknown medical 
history was found in his truck confused by the police on the 
morning of admission. According to the patient, he has nausea 
last night, which continued until this morning. He also had a 
bifrontal throbbing headache, which continues to be present. He 
is not sure whether the headache came on suddenly. He does not 
know why he was found in his truck with a laceration above his 
right eye, and a dislocated right middle finger.  It was 
hypothesized he may have had a seizure resulting in mild trauma 
and possible contra-coup injury (right frontal trauma with left 
posterior temporal contusion).  Other possibilities included 
arteriovenous malformation or underlying mass.  The patient was 
admitted to the neurology ICU for further management.
.
Hospital Course by problem;
.
Neuro; The patient was loaded on keppra upon admission and 
continued at 1000 mg bid.  He was monitored initially with q1h 
neurochecks.  His systolic blood pressure was maintained between 
100-140 without intervention.  A repeat CT head showed a stable 
intraparenchymal and small subdural hematoma.  MRI brain showed 
no evidence of underlying mass.  A CTA showed no sign of 
vascular malformation.  The patient will undergo repeat MRI 
brain with and without contrast in ___ weeks for further 
evaluation of his hemorrhage.  He will continue on keppra at 
1000 mg bid for at least six months.  The patient was 
transferred to the neurology floor on HD#2.  There he was 
evaluated by ___ who found that he was stable and able to 
ambulate without assistance. A repeat head CT on ___ showed no 
change in the intraparenchymal or subdural bleeds. He did not 
have any seizure activity while in house.
.
MSK; The patient was found to have a dislocation of his right 
middle finger which was subsequently reduced. This was splinted 
and did not cause him significant pain
.
CV/Pulm/Renal/GI: the patient was stable from a cardiac, 
pulmonary, renal and GI standpoint. He tolerated a regular diet 
without issues, he made adequate urine and did not have any 
desaturations.

On HD 5 the patient felt well and a repeat head CT showed no 
evolving process. He was anxious to return home to ___ 
as his family had finally arrived in ___. He will take all 
hospital documents with him and tranfer his care down to PA near 
his family. At the time of discharge he was ambulating without 
assistance, tolerating a regular diet but did have some 
persistent confusion. However, he and his family understood the 
gravity of his problem and certified that he would arrange 
follow up care with neurology and neurosurgery upon his return 
to ___.

multiple complaints in setting of hypoglycemic episodes and 
found to have potassium of ___ s/p dietary indiscretion with 
ingestion of many bananas. Patient's course was c/b labile blood 
sugars. It was recommended he stay to be monitored for this, but 
he left against medical advice on ___.

#Hyperkalemia: K 7.7 in setting of missed PD sessions and 
suspected dietary non compliance. treated with insulin, D50 and 
Ca gluconate, Kayexalate in ED and 2 cycles of PD, per renal 
team, increasing bowel regimen to facilitate K excretion. 
Patient had improvement of K in first few PD sessions, and 
continued to have normal K throughout the rest of the 
hospitalization.

#Hyperglycemia  - Type I DM prescribed NPH but not taking long 
acting who occasionally skips even his short acting d/t 
hypoglycemia. Last D/C summary shows he was getting Levemir 20 
Units Dinner. In the ED he was given 4.2% dextrose when normally 
uses 1.25% dextrose solution for PD and thus had glucose of 500. 
No urine, thus impossible to assess for urine ketones. He was 
placed on insulin gtt which q2h finger sticks until sugars were 
normal in the ED. He was seen by ___ who recommended. Per 
___: start on NPH insulin one injection of 16 units
before breakfast, which will cover his lunch and before supper.
regular insulin by carb counting 1:15 (as he used to do for only 
breakfast and supper. instructed to check BG before all meals 
and adjust the morning NPH based on the before supper BG, 
adjusts the regular in the morning based on the prelunch BG and 
adjusts the regular before supper based BG at bed time. His 
nighttime coverage was also supplemented by 40 units of insulin 
being placed in his diasylate. 

#Leukocytosis - Chest xray without consolidation. PD fluid 
without signs of infection.  LFTs WNL and no ABD pain making 
abdominal sourses (pancreatitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis) 
less likely. CXR negative and patient makes no urine. No 
evidence of diarrhea. Covered with CTX as intra-abdominal 
infection was possible and if so, would want to prevent fibrosis 
of peritoneum. This was d/c'ed as patient was afebrile and 
cultures negative. We observed him with leukocytosis for several 
days and extensive evaluation and work up remained negative. 

#Hyponatremia - Likely in the setting of missing PD leading to 
hypervolemic hyponatremia. Pseudohyponatremia also due to 
elevated glucose levels. Improved with treatment.
 
#Previous pancreas and kidney transplants: Continued prednisone 
5mg daily. Per D/C summary on ___, Tacro was stopped per 
renal team instructions; thus bactrim was stopped given no need 
for PCP ___.

#Coffee Ground Emesis - Pt vomited coffee ground emesis on 
arrival to the CCU. Pt states he had nausea and vomiting day 
prior but without blood. He continued to vomit on the ward but 
no blood or coffee grounds were observed. His LFTs were normal, 
thus less likely esophageal varices. In the setting of diabetes, 
gastroparesis was likely resulting in frequent N&V and thus MW 
tear was possible. Important to keep in mind Uremia can cause 
platelet dysfucntion. Given IV PPI BID, IV Zofran. Crit trend 
was stable. 

## TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
============================
# consider gastric emptying study
# please follow up blood sugars, adjust regimen as necessary
# Per ___: start on NPH insulin one injection of 16 units
before breakfast, which will cover his lunch and before supper.

adjusts the regular before supper based BG at bed time. 
Nighttime coverage was supplemented by 40 units of insulin 
placed in the diasylate dwell. He was urged to schedule a quick 
___ follow up visit.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It has been a pleasure taking part in your care. You were 
admitted to ___ for a dangerously high 
potassium level after missing dialysis twice. You were admitted 
to the intensive care unit where you were treated and observed, 
and subsequently transferred to the floor. Your potassium 
improved to normal. You were also seen by the foot doctors, who 
would like to follow up with you as noted below. 

You had hard-to-control blood sugars, and you were seen by the 
___ diabetes team, who provided recommendations for how to 
better control your blood sugars. Please follow these as 
described below. 

It was recommended that you stay in the hospital to try and fix 
your blood sugars, but you desired to leave against medical 
advice. You expressed an understanding of the risks involved 
with leaving prior to becoming more stable, which include 
diabetic ketoacidosis which can cause serious injury and death, 
and electrolyte abnormalities which can cause an irregular heart 
rhythm and death. Please follow up with health care providers as 
listed below.

Continue to perform dialysis on your normal schedule and 
maintain a low potassium diet. Please also take your insulin as 
prescribed and check your blood sugars regularly. This is 
crucial for you to maintain your health. Please follow up with 
all your appointments, and continue to take your medications as 
prescribed.

Again, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we 
wish you the best. If you develop any fevers, chills, 
uncontrolled blood sugars, or develop any concerning signs or 
symptoms, please call your doctor or present to the ED. 

We wish you the best,

- Your ___ care team

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted  and was taken to the operating room 
for a total knee arthroplasty. Please see operative report for 
details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated 
the procedure well. Pain was initially controlled with a PCA 
followed by a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The 
patient was placed in a CPM machine with range of motion that 
started at ___ degrees of flexion before being increased to 90 
degrees as tolerated. The patient received IV antibiotics for 24 
hours postoperatively, as well as lovenox for DVT prophylaxis 
starting on the morning of POD#1. The drain was removed without 
incident on POD#1. The Foley catheter was removed on POD#2 and 
the patient was subsequently voiding independently. The surgical 
dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was 
found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. 
 
On the morning of POD1 the pt went into rapid afib RVR.  15mg 
dilt pushed, med consult called.  His rate was then controlled.  
 His EKG did not show ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were 
negative.  Because of continued intermittent rapid ventricular 
response, his toprol was changed to lopressor 37.5mg TID and 
given 1pRBC with good response.  

He had a positive urine analysis, so he was empirically started 
on ciprofloxacin 500mg BID for planned 6 doses.  

While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical 
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and 
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was 
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was 
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was 
acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral 
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and 
the wound was benign. The patient progressed well with physical 
therapy. Post-operative Xrays demonstrated hardware in good 
position. The patient was discharged in stable condition.  The 
patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as tolerated 
on the operative extremity.

4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do 
not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool
softener (such as colace) as needed to prevent this side effect.
5. You may not drive a car until cleared to do so by your 
surgeon or your primary physician.
6. Please keep your wounds clean. You may shower starting five 
days after surgery, but no tub baths or swimming for at least 
four weeks. No dressing is needed if wound continues to be 
non-draining. Any stitches or staples that need to be removed 
will be taken out by the visiting nurse or rehab facility two 
weeks after your surgery.
7. Please call your surgeon's office to schedule or confirm your 
follow-up appointment in four weeks.
8. Please DO NOT take any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medications (NSAIDs such as celebrex, ibuprofen, advil, aleve,

9. ANTICOAGULATION: Please continue your lovenox for three weeks 
to help prevent deep vein thrombosis (blood clots).  After 
completing the lovenox, please take Aspirin 325mg daily for an 
additional three weeks.
10. WOUND CARE: Please keep your incision clean and dry. It is 
okay to shower five days after surgery but no tub baths, 
swimming, or submerging your incision until after your four week 
checkup. Please place a dry sterile dressing on the wound each 
day if there is drainage, otherwise leave it open to air. Check 
wound regularly for
signs of infection such as redness or thick yellow drainage. 
Staples will be removed by the visiting nurse or rehab facility

STUDY: Single portable AP chest radiograph.

INDICATION: Status post mitral valve replacement, please 
evaluate for pneumothorax
COMPARISON: ___.

FINDINGS: Study is limited by tubing from breathing mask 
overlying the right apex which is the region of interest. Subtle 
lucency remains in this area, however, exact extent of right 
apical pneumothorax is indeterminate. There is no shift in the 
mediastinum to suggest a tension component. The lungs are 
otherwise clear. There is a small left pleural effusion. Median 
sternotomy wires remain intact.
IMPRESSION: Limited radiograph given overlying tubing in the 
right apex. However, there is likely unchanged to slight 
improvement of right apical pneumothorax and repeat radiograph 
is recommended after overlying tubing has been removed.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

IMAGING: 

___ - Lower extremity DVT study
FINDINGS:  There are numerous hyperplastic lymph nodes with 
normal morphology 
in the right inguinal region.  There is normal respiratory 
phasicity in the 
common femoral veins bilaterally.  There is normal 
compressibility, flow, and 
augmentation of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, 
and popliteal 
veins.  Normal flow is demonstrated in the right posterior 
tibial and deep 
peroneal veins.  There is extensive subcutaneous edema 
throughout the right 
lower extremity. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis. 

MICROBIOLOGY:

Blood cultures from ___ pending at time of discharge.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: ___ year old male with a history of type one 
diabetes and failed kidney and pancreas transplant on peritoneal 
dialysis admitted for right foot cellulitis and volume overload. 
While he was at ___ his blood sugars were very labile and 
___ team was involved to help stabilize his blood 
sugar on a insulin regimen. Given his need for dialysis dosing 
his vancomycin was difficult and infections disease and renal 
were involved in managing his infection and peritoneal dialysis 
respectively. The lower extremity edema markedly improved with 
diuresis and peritoneal dialysis and his infection responded 
well to antibiosis. The renal team decreased his tacrolimus dose 
while in the hospital and discontinued his mycophenolate 
mofetil. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
 
# Lower extremity swelling/mild erythema: Likely due to to 
volume overload from inadequate volume extraction during 
initiation of peritoneal dialysis. His presentation and exam are 
consistent with cellulitis as well as volume overload. Initially 
antibiotics were stopped beacuse the thought was that his 
symptoms were more consistant with volume overload. However 
after the resolution of edema secondary to overload there was a 
clear demarcation of erythema and warmth on the right ankle and 
foot consistant with cellilutus. Vancomycin was restarted and 
vancomycin levels followed given kidney disease. 

# Kidney Failure. Currently on peritoneal dialysis. Given poor 
graft function renal was consulted and the patient was diuresed 
and peritoneal dialysis optimized. The patients mycophenolate 
mofetil was discontinued and tacrolimus dose was decreased to 
2mg per day. His prednisone dose remains the same. During his 
stay he made some urine. He will need close renal follow up as 
an outpatient. 
  
# Type 1 Diabetes: During this hospitilaztion the patient's 
blood sugars were very labile. ___ was consulted to help 
stabalize his blood sugar on a insulin regimen while in the 
hospital and after discharge. 
  
# Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive intermittently 
during his hospitilzation. His home metoprolol and amlodipine 
were continued. More aggressive control was avoided given 
diuresis and concern for hypotension. The patient's blood 
pressure when markedly elevated was treated with hydralazine. At 
the time of discharge losartan was added. This will need to be 
follow as at outpatient. 
 
# Depression: Chronic stable issue. The patient was continued on 
his home citalopram dose.   

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- FOLLOW PERITONEAL DIALYSIS AND VOLUME STATUS; MAY NEED TO 
CONSIDER DIURESIS
- WILL NEED PRIMARY, RENAL, AND ___ FOLLOW UP AFTER 
DISCHARGE
- WAS CONSISTANTLY HYPERTENSIVE DESPITE DIURESIS, THIS WILL NEED 
TO BE FOLLOWED FOR POSSIBLE MEDICATION ADJUSTMENT

atelectasis and trace right pleural effusion.  No 
subdiaphragmatic free air seen.

RUQ ultrasound  ___: IMPRESSION:
1. Nodular liver with coarsened echotexture and large volume 
ascites, compatible with hepatic cirrhosis.
2. The portal vein is patent with normal hepatopetal flow.
3. 1.1 cm hyperechoic lesion adjacent to the falciform ligament 
for which further characterization with dedicated MRI is 
recommended.

CT abdomen ___: 
1. Nodular liver with large volume simple ascites, which can be 
seen in the setting of cirrhosis.  Although no discrete 
peritoneal enhancement is seen, underlying peritonitis cannot be 
excluded, and clinical correlation with possible fluid sampling 
is recommended
2. No signs of loculated fluid collection or bowel perforation.  
Normal appendix.
3. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Small nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F w/ PMH of presumed alcohol cirrhosis 
here with abdominal pain and increased girth secondary to 
worsening ascites who was discharged with improved pain.

Acute Issues:
#Abdominal pain- likely secondary to increased ascites as there 
was no intraperitoneal disease found on CT scan.  Furthermore 
her pain improved with therapeutic paracentis of 6.5L.  Her 
diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP.

Ascites fluid leak - due to persist fluid leak a suture was 
placed by surgery.  #This was successful in stopping the leak.  
Suture may be removed in approx 10 days from placement on the 
day of discharge.

#Cirrhosis- patient reported receiving her previous care at 
___. When she presented she had evidence of 
large amount of ascites. Normal coags and plateltes and low 
albumin. She had a therapeutic paracentesis -6.5L, and had 
leaking para site on the LLQ that required a figure 8 stitch to 
be placed to stop the leaking. She reported still drinking 
alcohol.  Labs performed here were negative for other sources of 
cirrhosis detectable by lab serology. She had no evidence of 
encephalopathy, no spider angiomas.  Her blood pressure ran low 
and she had mild hyponatremia.  Due to her low blood pressure 
(80s/50s) it was decided to hold her diuretics on discharge and 
that she would followup with her PCP in ___ couple of days to 
repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics at a low dose. 
She was counseled on adhering to a low sodium diet and fluid 
restriction of 2L. Suture to be removed the week of 
___ will have followup in the ___ clinic with 
Dr. ___ on ___. 

#Alcohol use- patient with alcohol use. She had presumed alcohol 
cirrhosis secondary to it.  She was placed on the CIWA scale and 
never scored or showed signs of withdrawal.

#Low blood pressure- patient had blood pressure in the ___. 
She had no orthostaic symptoms and her blood pressure increased 
with sitting and standing.  Her urine was dilute and therefore 
it was felt that this  was not secondary to volume depletion and 
could be due to her underlying liver disease.  

Chronic/transitional Issue:
#Hypertension- patient reported being on HCTZ on admission. This 
was held during her stay and at the time of discharge.  We do 
not anticipate restarting as an outpatient as the pt appears to 
have low BPs chronically from cirrhosis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.
You were admitted to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain. 
You had excessive fluid in your abdomen due to too much salt and 
fluid intake and not taking your diuretics (water pills).  You 
had this fluid removed by paracentesis. You had some continued 
output from the paracentesis site and had a stitch placed. This 
stitch should remain in place for 1 week and removed by a 
clinician at that time.
 It is very important that you avoid salt in your diet and do 
not take in too much fluid. We also recommend that you cut down 
on your alcohol use and seek assistance in ways to do this 
safely if you choose to do it. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, cirrhosis, and ascites. She presented with abdominal pain and was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Her chief complaint was abdominal pain, which was likely secondary to increased ascites. She had a diagnostic paracentesis, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was given zofran and morphine and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

The patient has a past medical history of EtOH abuse, cirrhosis, and ascites. She has allergies to epinephrine. She was prescribed several medications, including lasix, spironolactone, azithromycin, and levofloxacin, but was unsure why she was prescribed these medications.

The patient's physical exam revealed a firm, distended abdomen with a positive fluid wave and diffusely tender to palpation. She had no organomegaly appreciable. Her discharge physical exam revealed a firm, nondistended abdomen with a slight bulge of her umbilical hernia.

The patient's laboratory results showed mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase and normal liver function tests. Her urine analysis showed a trace of protein and a few white blood cells. Her ascites fluid analysis showed a high white blood cell count and a high protein level.

The patient's imaging studies showed low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and a small right pleural effusion on chest X-ray. Her RUQ ultrasound showed a nodular liver with coarsened echotexture and large volume ascites, compatible with hepatic cirrhosis. Her CT abdomen showed a nodular liver with large volume simple ascites and no signs of loculated fluid collection or bowel perforation.

The patient's hospital course was marked by an acute issue of abdominal pain, which was likely secondary to increased ascites. She had a therapeutic paracentesis of 6.5L and had a persisting fluid leak, which was successfully stopped with a suture. She was discharged with improved pain and was advised to follow up with her PCP in a couple of days to repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics. ||endoftext||"

conversion with vagal maneuvers, metoprolol, and adenosine 
without success, so she was successfully electrically 
cardioverted with restoration of sinus rhythm. Her symptoms 
improved and she admitted for monitoring overnight 
post-cardioversion. She was stable the day after cardioversion 
and was discharged on an increased dose of metoprolol XL and PCP 
follow up. 
- AC: Continued home ___ 20mg daily
- RC: INCREASED home metoprolol succinate to 100mg daily

her weight was 195lbs on admission. She reports subacute 
increase in ___ swelling, which she manages with Lasix 20mg 
daily, but otherwise reports no other symptoms consistent with 
CHF exacerbation. She was felt to be stable given reassuring 
exam and subacute onset and was discharged on her home dose of 
Lasix with close PCP follow up to monitor volume exam.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================   
- You were admitted because your heart rate was very fast 

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You came into the hospital feeling poorly from a very fast 
heart rate called atrial flutter. We tried to treat you with 
medications to normalize your heart rhythm, but when that didn't 
work, we shocked your heart back into normal rhythm.
- We monitored you overnight after the procedure to make sure 
your heart rhythm stayed normal. You had occasional bouts of 
atrial fibrillation with faster heart rates, but this can be 
controlled with medication at home. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Be sure to take all your medications and attend all of your 
appointments listed below. 
 
Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 57-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of a foot ulcer. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, type 1, and has undergone a renal transplant. He also has a history of peripheral vascular disease, gastroparesis, osteoporosis, and chronic immunosuppression. The patient's past medical history is significant for chronic rejection versus medication effect, and he has been experiencing labile blood sugars and hypoglycemic unawareness.

The patient's presenting symptoms included a new right heel ulcer, which was diagnosed as a chronic wound with chronic changes on X-ray. He was treated with IV vancomycin and zosyn, and was admitted to the hospital for further management.

The patient's physical examination revealed a chronically ill-appearing individual with a 2cm ulcer on the lateral aspect of his right heel, which was mildly painful on examination. He was also found to have a history of chronic rejection versus medication effect, and was taking immunosuppressive medications.

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 7.0, hemoglobin of 11.5, and hematocrit of 36.2. His blood glucose level was 232, and his urea nitrogen level was 30. His creatinine level was 2.2, and his sodium level was 137.

The patient's diagnosis was a chronic wound with chronic changes on X-ray, and he was treated with IV vancomycin and zosyn. He was also prescribed medications at discharge, including IV pip-tazo and IV vancomycin.

The patient's social history is significant for a sedentary lifestyle, which has led to his current wheelchair-bound state. He has also had a history of hypertension, but is not currently taking medications for it. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with HCV cirrhosis c/b ascites, refractory to 
increasing medical diuresis, requiring admission for 
paracentesis, in setting of increased dyspnea. Found to have 
pulmonary emboli.

# HCV Cirrhosis/Abdominal distension: The patient initially 
underwent an attempted bedside paracentesis, which only yielded 
small amounts of hemorrhagic ascites. He then underwent 
ultrasound-guided diagnostic/therapeutic paracenteses x 2, each 
of which was negative for infection or malignancy. He received 
IV albumin with the procedures. He reported somewhat improved 
respiratory status after the paracenteses, often alluding to his 
new ability to finish a sentence without having to take a 
breath. MRI showed stable solitary liver lesion. LFTs were 
generally stable. His furosemide and spironolactone were 
initally held, then restarted. He was discharged on his home 
dose of spironolactone, which has caused him side effects 
(breast tenderness) on higher doses. He was also discharged on 
an increased dose of furosemide, with instructions to have his 
electrolytes and renal function checked at his primary care 
follow-up visit on ___. Of note, the patient's paracentesis 
site on his RLQ continued to leak ascites for several days. 
Ostomy bag was placed to collect the ascites, and the patient 
ultimately had multiple stitches placed over the paracentesis 
site, to prevent further leakage. The stitch was non-absorbable, 
and will have to be removed at a follow-up visit.

# Pulmonary Emboli: The patient was persistently tachycardic and 
remained short of breath after his large-volume paracentesis. 
ABG revealed hypoxia, and the patient desaturated to the 
mid-high 80's when ambulatory. Lower extremity ultrasound was 
negative for deep venous thrombosis. He had CTA performed, which 
revealed bilateral segmental/sub-segmental pulmonary emboli, and 
was immediately initiated on a heparin drip, without a bolus (no 
bolus ___ concern over hemorrhagic ascites). He was initiated on 
warfarin as well, and took several nights of ___ mg warfarin, 
to reach a therapeutic INR of 2.7, on day of discharge. He was 
discharged on warfarin 5 mg PO QHS. Discussions took place 
between the patient's primary care physician and the admitting 
team, and the patient was scheduled to see the PCP on ___ 
___, where the PCP would assume responsibility for checking 
INR's and managing the patient's warfarin regimen.

No clear cause for PE was identified, as the patient reported up 
to date cancer screening (no malignancy on colonoscopy/biopsy, 
normal PSA), and did not have any clear risk factors for blood 
clots.

# Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was consistently 
normotensive during the admission. He was discharged on 
furosemide and spironolactone, as mentioned above.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: The patient demonstrated a good mood with 
little anxiety, during the admission. He was continued on his 
home regimen of amitriptyline.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr ___,
You were admitted to the hospital to undergo a paracentesis for 
your increasing abdominal distension. Bedside paracentesis 
yielded small amounts of bloody fluid, and the attempt was 
aborted. The following day you underwent paracentesis with 
radiologic guidance, which yielded 5 liters of fluid, which was 
sent for analysis. You had a repeat paracentesis done several 
days later. Each time, your abdominal fluid was negative for 
infection.
.
You had low oxygen levels when walking, so you had a CT scan of 
your chest, which showed pulmonary emboli (blood clots) in both 
lungs. You were started on blood thinning medication, initially 
through the IV and later in pill form. Your coumadin levels were 
at the appropriate levels on the day of discharge, but you will 
need to have this rechecked by your primary care physician. You 
should also have your electrolytes and kidney function tests 
checked by your PCP, as we have changed your diuretic 
medications.
.
The puncture sites from your paracenteses continued to leak 
fluid for several days. We placed a surgical stitch to try to 
stop the leakage. This leak will stop as your skin and soft 
tissue heal. In the meantime, you should place tight gauze 
dressings with paper tape over your skin. If the leakage 
persists or worsens, you can place ostomy bags over the leak to

Microbiology:
CMV viral load (___): Not detected
Stool (___): Negative for C. difficile
Blood x2 (___): No growth
Urine (___): No growth
Blood x2 (___): No growth to date

Pathology:
Pancreas, allograft, needle core biopsy (___):
Changes consistent with severe acute cell-mediated rejection, 
with:
1.  Fibrinoid necrotizing arteritis.
2.  Septal vasculitis.
3.  Septal ductal inflammation.
4.  Neural inflammation.
5.  Multifocal inflammatory acinar involvement and acinar 
damage.
6.  CMV immunohistochemical stain is negative.
7.  Trichrome stain shows minimally increased fibrous tissue (no 
significant loss of acinar parenchyma).

ADDENDUM  #1: 
Immunostain for C4d demonstrates focal staining (defined as 
between 5 and 50%) of interacinar capillaries and diffuse 
staining of venous and arteriolar endothelium within septae. 
Staining evaluated and reported per the criteria as set forth by 
___, ___ Journal of Transplantation, ___ (10):1669-76. 
 
ADDENDUM #2:
A C4D immunostain reveals staining of intra-acinar capillaries 
approximately 30%.  The significance of this finding has to be 
correlated with DSA testing.  The biopsy findings here 
(prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, prominent septal 
inflammation, venulitis and ductal inflammation) favor AMCR.  
Given the c4d staining, a combined ACMR and antibody-mediated 
rejection occurring simultaneously is a consideration..

Imaging:
Pancreas ultrasound (___):
No evidence of pancreatic or peripancreatic fluid collections or 
pancreatic
duct dilatation.  Symmetrical vascularity throughout the graft, 
although
somewhat diminished in comparison to the ___ scans.

CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast (___):
1.  No evidence for colitis.
2.  Normal radiographic appearance of the pancreatic transplant.

Pancreatic ultrasound with Doppler (___):
No pancreatic ductal dilatation and no peripancreatic fluid 
collection seen. Normal Doppler examination of the transplanted 
pancreas.

CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast (___):
1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process.  Specifically, no 
evidence of a fluid collection around the pancreatic graft in 
the right aspect of the pelvis.
2. Bilateral too small to characterize renal hypodensities, 
statistically
simple cysts.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of type 1 diabetes mellitus 
status post deceased donor pancreas transplant in ___ referred 
to the ED for elevated pancreatic enzymes and found to have cell 
mediated/humoral rejection on the basis of pancreatic biopsy and 
treated with plasmapheresis, IVIG, antithymocyte globulin, 
steroid taper, and rituximab.

Active Issues:
(1)Pancreatic rejection: Despite pancreatic ultrasound and CT 
abdomen/pelvis on admission with radiographic features 
unconcerning for rejection, initial suspicion for rejection on 
the basis of elevated amylase and lipase was confirmed on CT 
guided pancreatic biopsy with histologic evidence of humoral and 
cell mediated rejection. He was treated with a steroid taper 
(methylprednisolone 500mg IV daily x3 days, followed by 
prednisone 60mg PO daily x2 days, 40mg PO daily x2 days, and 
20mg PO daily indefinitely), antithymocycte globulin x7, 
plasmapheresis x5, weight based IVIG, and a single dose of 
rituximab. Response to therapy was monitored via daily T 
lymphocyte subsets and periodic donor specific antibody screens. 
Tacrolimus was increased from 2mg bid to 5mg bid to maintain 
therapeutic levels and home dose mycophenolate 500mg bid was 
continued. Pantoprazole, valgancyclovir, 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nystatin were given 
prophylactically in the setting of high dose 
steroids/immunosuppression. Amylase and lipase downtrended over 
the course of admission from 164 to 101 and 334 to 139, 
respectively. He was advised to have weekly labs checked and 
sent to Dr. ___ has followup with him ___.

(2)Type 1 diabetes mellitus: He is no longer diabetic/insulin 
dependent following pancreatic transplant. Fingersticks were 
found to be elevated to 200s in the setting of pancreatic 
rejection with high dose steroid administration, prompting 
initiation of gentle Humalog insulin sliding scale to maintain 
euglycemia. He was advised to check his fingersticks at home and 
if your fasting blood sugars persistently greater than 150, to 
call Dr. ___. He was provided testing supplies

(3)Fever: He experienced isolated low-grade fever to 100.7 on 
___, without localizing signs/symptoms of infection and 
unrevealing infectious work up, including negative 
urinalysis/urine culture and blood culture with no growth. Fever 
did not recur throughout the remainder of admission.

(4)Visual symptoms: He developed right sided floater on ___, 
with no gross visual field or extraocular movement deficits. He 
was evaluated by ophthalmology who determined he had Inferior 
vitreous hemorrhage and Posterior vitreous detachment OD. They 
advised no urgent interventions, but that pt needs to follow up 
with his Ophthalmologist as outpatient.

(5)Acute on chronic loose stools: In the setting of report on 
acute on chronic loose stools on admission, CMV viral load was 
undetectable and C. difficile assay negative. CT abdomen/pelvis 
on admission was without evidence of colitis. Loose stools did 
not occur throughout admission, but perhaps reflected some 
element of exocrine dysfunction.

(6)Cytopenia: He experienced period cytopenias, including white 
blood cell count nadiring at 3, hematocrit as low as 30.3 (from 
baseline of 39 to 40), and platelets to 110s (from baseline of 
210s) in the setting of high dose immunosuppression. There were 
no signs of bleeding or infection.

Inactive Issues:
(1)Hypertension: He remained normotensive on home metoprolol 
succinate.

(2)Hypothyroidism: Home levothyroxine was continued. 

(3)Hyperlipidemia: Home atorvastatin was continued.  

(4)Depression: His mood remained stable on home sertraline.

Transitional Issues:
1) Weekly safety labs
2) Outpatient ophtho followup
3) Consider low dose home insulin (standing or sliding scale) if 
fasting blood glucose persistently elevated >150.

The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

craniotomy. Small amount of dense material is seen in the region 
of the 
aneurysm clip, and there is a small amount of hyperdense left 
extra-axial 
fluid overlying the convexity, consistent with post-surgical 
change. There is 
a moderate amount of expected post-surgical pneumocephalus. 
There is no 
significant edema or mass effect. Ventricles and sulci are 
unchanged in size 
and configuration. 
IMPRESSION: Status post left MCA aneurysm clip via left frontal 
craniotomy, 
with expected post-surgical change and pneumocephalus. No large 
intracranial 
hemorrhage. 

 
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___ 9:12 AM  
  
FINDINGS: The patient is status post left MCA aneurysm clipping, 
via a left frontal craniotomy. Streak artifact from the aneurysm 
clip limits evaluation of adjacent regions. Again demonstrated 
are post-surgical changes with 
pneumocephalus overlying the left frontal lobe, as well as 
multiple locules of 
air seen superiorly near the vertex, which appear new from ___. 
Additionally, there is a small hyperdensity surrounding the 
aneurysm clip as 
well as hyperdense left extra-axial fluid overlying the left 
convexity, as 
seen previously. No new foci of hemorrhage is identified. There 
is no 
evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction. 
Caliber of the 
ventricular system is unchanged. Osseous structures reveal 
post-surgical 
changes of the left frontal and temporal bones. 
  
IMPRESSION: Status post left MCA aneurysm clip via left frontal 
craniotomy, 
with post-surgical changes, including pneumocephalus, and small 
foci of 
hemorrhage as described. Since prior study, locules of air seen

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with a PMH of HepC cirrhosis 
who was reportedly found down at home around 930 am on ___ 
by EMS. It is unclear who contacted EMS or how long the patient 
was down for. Per ___ records, she was somnolent and only 
responsive to pain and was subsequently intubated. Her BP's were 
soft to the 70-80's systolic and a femoral line was placed and 
dopamine was started. Labs were significant for a transaminitis 
(unknown if new or old), tylenol level of 5, salicylate level of 
2.7, and a trop of 1.5 with no EKG changes. She received 
vanc/zosyn CT head/abd/pelvis/chest negative. She was 
subsequently transferred to ___ for further management. 

In the ED, vitals: 94 91/45 15 100. She was switched from 
dopamine to levophed (pressures dropped to 50/30 during switch) 
and she was placed on fentanyl/propofol. Pressures were still 
soft and she was transitioned off propofol to versed. Toxicology 
was consulted and recommended NAC although it was unclear 
whether this was an ingestion. Cardiology was also consulted in 
the ED for troponin of 1.5. Pressures were in 90-100's at 
transfer.

In the unit, the patient was intubated and sedated. Her

Imaging
=======

___ EKG
Sinus rhythm. Possible old septal myocardial infarction. Low QRS 
voltage in the precordial leads. Non-specific ST-T wave 
abnormalities. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post endotracheal intubation.  
The
endotracheal tube terminates about 5.5 cm above the carina.  An 
orogastric
tube courses into the stomach and terminates in the fundus.  
Surgical clips project over the left axillary region.
The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal 
limits. 
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear 
clear.  
IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  No evidence 
of acute
cardiopulmonary disease.

___ TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: 
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and 
global biventricular systolic function.

___ RUQ US
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Normal hepatic echotexture. No focal hepatic lesions.
2.  Trace ascites.
3.  Prominent fluid-filled loops of bowel, which is nonspecific.

___ KUB
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.  No evidence of 
pneumoperitoneum.

___ CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
1. Findings consistent with a small bowel obstruction.
2. Diffuse anasarca, diffuse small amount of ascites, small 
right pleural
effusion.
3. Chronic findings including atherosclerotic disease, with 
surgical clips and probable partial colectomy.
4. Despite a history of hepatitis and cirrhosis, there is no 
evidence to
suggest portal hypertension, liver appearance is unremarkable.

___ CT head w/o contrast
IMPRESSION: Limiited study secondary to motion artifact. 
Unremarkable unenhanced head CT.

___ KUB
FINDINGS:  There is an enteric tube whose side port is at the GE 
junction. This could be advanced several centimeters for more 
optimal placement.  Thereis a relative paucity of bowel gas.  
There is air seen within the rectum.  No definite dilated loops 
of bowel are seen. However, Please note that the dilated small 
bowel loops were fluid filled on the CT, thus it is difficult to 
assess for change in the degree of obstruction. There is no free 
intra-abdominal gas.

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___. 
Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right-sided central venous 
line are 
unchanged in position.  Heart size is within normal limits.  
There is some coarsening of the bronchovascular markings without 
signs for overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.  No 
pneumothoraces are seen. 

___ CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:  
1. Interval decompression of small bowel loops. Oral contrast is 
seen to the level of the rectum. There is small bowel and 
colonic wall thickening with may represent edema related to 
recent small bowel obstruction or liver dysfunction. However, 
underlying infection or malignancy cannot be excluded. 
2. There is loculated abdominal ascites and hepatic cirrhosis. 
3. There is a focal hypodensity in the right kidney which was 
not definitely present on the prior exam. This finding is 
suspicious for focal pyelonephritis. Recommend correlation with 
urinalysis. 
4. There is enterocolic intussusception without obstruction at 
the level of the enterocolic anastomosis. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with a PMH of HepC cirrhosis 
who was found down at home, intubated at ___ and 
placed on pressors, and transferred to ___ for further 
management.

ACUTE ISSUES
============

#Septic shock: Patient with bandemia to 19 and tachycardia as 
well as hypotension. Could potentially have an infectious 
source, potentially intra-abdominal given her history of 
abdominal surgery. Received a dose of vanc/zosyn at ___. 
She was maintained on vanc/cefepime at ___. Cardiogenic shock 
ruled out with a normal TTE. CT torso and serial CXR showed 
nothing localizing. C. diff negative on ___. Her blood and urine 
cultures remained negative. Initially, it was unclear if her 
hypotension was due to septic shock, toxic injection, 
hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock, but as her hospital course 
progressed, septic shock was most likely. She was given fluid 
boluses and was initially maintained on levophed/vasopressin. 
Pressors were weaned by ___ and vancomycin/cefepime was 
maintained until ___. She was also given flagyl empirically 
for concern for C. difficile infection as her stool output 
increased (started on IV flagyl on ___, switched to po on ___ 
as patient able to take po's). After antiobiotics were 
discontinued, the patient demonstrated no further signs of 
sepsis or infection (no hypotension, no fevers, no white count).

#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy:  Likely from septic shock. 
Patient had slightly elevated levels of tylenol and ASA but 
unclear if a true ingestion. She also has a significant acidosis 
that may be contributing as well as electrolyte abnormalities. 
Finally, there was initially concern that she has a hx cirrhosis 
and may be experiencing hepatic encephalopathy; this was later 
disproven after discussion with her PCP. A final etiology may be 
seizure activity. Upon arrival, she was started on NAC for 
possibly tylenol ingestion. Her electrolyte abnormalities were 
corrected. She was initially given lactulose out of concern for 
possible hepatic encephalopathy but this was later held. She was 
treated for septic shock per above. In addition, a 20-minute EEG 
showed numerous discharges and a 24-hour EEG was performed, 
which showed no evidence of seizure. After she was transferred 
to the floor, her mental status improved markedly. She became 
alert, oriented x 3, attentive, and conversive.

# Diarrhea: While in the ICU, the patient developed profuse, 
watery diarrhea. C. diff was ruled out. A rectal tube was 
placed, and remained as the patient was transferred to the 
floor. When arriving to the hospital floor, the patient noted 
abdominal pain. A CT was obtained that showed enterocolic 
intussusception without obstruction at the level of the 
enterocolic anastomosis. It was also learned, from the patient's 
stepdaughter, that the patient was previously found down with 
opioid intoxication, hypotension, and ischemic colitis for which 
she had colostomy and reversal. Since this event, the patient 
had been having diarrhea since, requiring Imodium ___ times per 
day and still having loose stools. Because of no obstruction and 
history of diarrhea, follow-up colonoscopy with GI was 
recommended as an outpatient. With negative stool cultures and

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___. 
You were admitted because you were found nearly unconscious at 
home with a low blood pressure. You were intubated to protect 
your ability to bereathe. You were admitted to an ICU because of 
your near-unconcsious state and low blood pressure and there was 
also concern for infection and started on antibiotics. Your low 
blood pressure and possible infection likely resulted in 
temporary decreased blood flow to the liver and bowel. Your 
liver became inflamed, but this resolved. You continued to have 
diarrhea, but this responded to Imodium and pancreatic enzymes. 
Because of multiple transfers, you also became confused. After a 
few days out of the ICU, your confusion resolved. We would like 
you to follow up with a liver doctor as an outpatient and this 
will be arranged for you.

Sincerely,

Your ___ care team

IMAGING
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is bilateral diffuse 
reticulonodular opacity in the lower lung fields and 
ground-glass haziness. These findings are compatible with 
pulmonary edema. Dialysis catheter is in unchanged position with 
tip seen in the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. Cluster of 
calcifications in the right mid lung are unchanged. The aorta is 
tortuous and calcified. There is mild cardiomegaly. No definite 
pleural effusions are seen.
.
___ TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
inferior akinesis and near akinesis of the distal half of the 
septum and anterior walls. The apex is aneurysmal and akinetic. 
The remaining segments contract well (LVEF 30%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image 
quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w 
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased 
and global left ventricular systolic function is improved with 
slight decrease in cavity size. Regional left ventricular 
dysfunction is similar.
.
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison with the study of 
___, there has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary 
vascular congestion with the pulmonary vessels now only mildly 
engorged. Minimal atelectatic change is seen at the left base 
and there may be blunting of the costophrenic angle. 
Hemodialysis catheter remains in place.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F w/ CAD s/p MI (in ___ and previous 2 stents in RCA and 
LAD, scleroderma, HTN, ESRD on HD s/p transplant x2, and 
systolic HF (EF ___ who comes in with chronic burning chest 
pain and acute systolic heart failure.
.  
# Acute Systolic CHF: Patient presented with increased dyspnea 
and chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema. Physical exam 
demonstrated rales to mid lung fields. Patient reports increased 
dyspnea prior to dialysis recently and may need change to dry 
weight. She had a session of ultrafiltration the night of 
admission and then a truncated 2-hour session of dialysis the 
following day. In keeping with her outpatient schedule, the pt 
went for a full session of dialysis on ___. ECHO showed an 
EF of 30% and so she was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg 
qHS, with lisinopril 2.5mg to possibly be started as an 
outpatient (and to be titrated up as her blood pressure will 
tolerate it and also to be held on her dialysis days). After her 
dialysis session, pt's symptoms improved, physical exam 
demonstrated clear lung fields, and chest xray showed interval 
improvement in pulmonary edema. 
.
#. Chest Pain/Burning: Pts pain was atypical. Her symptom has 
bothered her each evening for a very long time, and is 
exacerbated when she lies on her back. It is thought to be GI 
related per outpatient providers and will follow up with GI in 
one week. EKG was without changes, and discomfort resolved on 
arrival and with subsequent nitroglycerin. Her cardiac enzymes 
were trended until they peaked. She was put on PPI and carafate, 
which seemed to provide relief of her pain. 
. 
#. ESRD sp transplant on HD: Pt had a session of ultrafiltration 
on the night of admission and was continued on her outpatient 
schedule of dialysis, ___. Her graft is 
well-functioning and her tunneled catheter was pulled. She was 
continued on her home prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus, and 
calcitriol. Her tacrolimus levels were within target. The amount 
of fluid they were able to take off and the length of time spent 
on dialysis was limited by pt's low blood pressure. She will 
continue to have 4 hours of dialysis, three times a week, with 
the next session on ___ and an estimated dry weight of 
67.5kg. 
.   
# CAD: Pt was continued on her home statin and ASA. 
.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was in sinus rhythm, and had no active issues with 
her rhythm during the admission. She was monitored on telemetry
.
#. Normocytic Anemia: At recent baseline. Secondary to ESRD. She 
was continued on Aranesp with dialysis per her outpatient 
regimen and given 1 unit pRBC with an appropriate increase in 
her hematocrit.
.   
# HTN: Blood pressure was well controlled on presentation. She 
was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg qHS, with lisinopril to 
possibly be started as an outpatient as long as her blood 
pressure can tolerate it. Her lisinopril should be held on 
hemodialysis days due to low blood pressures.
.  
# HLD: Pt was continued on her home Lipitor.    
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Recommend initiating lisinopril 2.5mg daily as an outpatient 
as long as her blood pressures can tolerate it. This medication 
should be held on hemodialysis days.
STOP taking calcitriol
START nephrocaps as a vitamin for your kidneys
START pantoprazole twice daily for your heartburn
START carafate up to four times per day for your heartburn, do 
not take this within 1 hour of your other medications
START taking Maalox (calcium and simethicone) as needed for your 
heartburn
START Metoprolol at night to lower your heart rate and avoid 
chest pain.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.
You had some chest discomfort that brought you into the 
hospital. We think that some of this discomfort is because of 
your stomach and have started you on a new medicine and 
scheduled an appt with a gastroenterologist on ___. At 
the same time, you had too much fluid in your lungs and we 
removed a little more fluid with dialysis and adjusted your 
dialysis medications. Your weight this morning is 150 pounds. 
This should be considered your new dry weight. Weigh yourself 
every morning, call your nephrologist if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. You were also anemic 
and received one unit of blood. Please call Dr. ___ 
___ NP if you have chest pain/burning at home that 
is worse than the mild chest burning you have experienced for 
the last few months. You may take Calcium carbonate for this 
burning, sit up straight in a chair and avoid spicy or acidic 
foods.  
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. STOP taking calcitriol
2. START nephrocaps as a vitamin for your kidneys
3. START pantoprazole twice daily for your heartburn
4. START carafate up to four times per day for your heartburn, 
do not take this within 1 hour of your other medications
5. START taking Maalox (calcium and simethicone) as needed for 
your heartburn
6. START Metoprolol at night to lower your heart rate and avoid 
chest pain.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 57-year-old female who was admitted with burning chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a history of coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction and stenting, as well as scleroderma, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She was previously a renal transplant recipient, but her current transplant is failing. She was admitted to the hospital with pulmonary edema and dyspnea, and was intubated for respiratory distress. She was started on dialysis and was treated with lasix, which provided relief from her symptoms. She was also prescribed furosemide and omeprazole.

The patient's diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the report, but it appears that she has chronic kidney disease, pulmonary edema, and possibly gastrointestinal issues contributing to her chest pain. She underwent a removal of a tunneled dialysis catheter and was started on CPAP in the emergency department.

At discharge, the patient's medications included furosemide, omeprazole, and possibly other medications not specified in the report. Her physical exam was notable for mild respiratory distress, but she was otherwise stable and comfortable while sitting upright with oxygen. ||endoftext||"

and MV replacement and with tricuspid regurgitation on coumadin 
who presents with melena and weakness.   

## Anemia/Melena/GAVE: Hgb 8.9 on admission. He recieved 1 unit 
of PRBC on admission. His hemoglobin was stable during his 
hospitalization and he had only a small amount of dark stool 
that likely represented old blood and this resolved for 24 hours 
prior to discharge. His vitals were stable and he continued to 
not have bleeding despite 3 days of heparin drip at theraputic 
dose. He received 4 days of ceftriaxone for SBP PPX and on 
discharge will complete a 7 day course with ciprofloxacin BID 
for 3 more days. His omeprazole was increased from 20mg PO daily 
to 40mg PO BID. The GI bleed was felt to be related to the APC 
of the GAVE 2 days prior to admission and had resolved. He will 
have outpatient follow up with his GI provider ___ 1 week of 
discharge. He was transitioned from heparin to enoxaparin bridge 
and will continue couamdin with INR check on ___. 

## Valvular heart disease s/p AVR/MVR on coumadin: Pt has 
mechanical valve replacement. On coumadin for anticoagulation, 
goal 2.5-3.5. Given mechanical valves, cannot stop 
anticoagulation for procedures. Coumadin restarted on ___ and he 
was maintained on a heparin bridge while in the hospital and 
transitioned from heparin to enoxaparin bridge and will continue 
couamdin with INR check on ___. 

# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Cr 1.9 on admission, GFR 39. 
Baseline 1.3-1.5. With holding of lisinopril and diuretics his 
creatinine returned to his baseline at 1.4. Likely prerenal 
cause ___ due to blood loss. He will continue off his 
lisinopril until he follows up with his PCP in several days but 
will restart his diuretics.

## CIRRHOSIS: Unclear cause as initial screening labs 
unrevealing.  Possibly due to NAFLD given history of 
dyslipidemia vs tricuspid regurgitation. Labs suggest he is 
currently compensated despite bleeding from likely GAVE, which 
may or may not be related to his cirrhosis. LFTs at baseline. 

## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt reports having paroxysmal Afib. 
Sounds regular on exam, but EKG consistent with Afib. On digoxin 
and coumadin at home. Digoxin level at goal despite ___. He was 
maintained on a heparin bridge while in the hospital and 
transitioned from heparin to enoxaparin bridge and will continue 
couamdin with INR check on ___.

# OSA: He was continued on CPAP while in the hospital.  
   
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
- LOvenox 80mg SC BID until INR >2.5. Next INR due on ___.
- Holding home lisinopril on discharge as he had ___ on 
admission. WIll follow up with Dr. ___ prior to restarting 
it.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ is a ___ woman on 
day +174 after an allogeneic cord blood transplant for 
lymphoblastic crisis of CML, h/o breast cancer, h/o of BK and 
HHV-6 viremia presenting with altered mental status and 
seizures.  
.  
# Seizure: The patient had two seizures before being admitting 
to the floor, one at home and another at the ___ ER. Both were 
witnessed. The patient had a lumbar puncture in the ER and 
bacterial cultures, cryptococcal antigen, ___ virus, VZV and CMV 
viruses were sent. Other viruses and cultures would have been 
sent, though there was not enough CSF sample and since the 
patient improved clinically, the team felt the risks of a lumbar 
puncture outweighed the benefits. The patient had a MRI with 
contrast and EEG which were both normal. ___ virus, CMV and 
cryptococcal antigen were normal. Her CSF fluid analysis was not 
concerning for infection or malignancy and the preliminary 
bacterial culture data showed no growth to date. Neurology 
consulted on the patient and recommended starting the patient on 
Keppra.
.
The patient was empirically started on vancomycin, levaquin and 
continued her home posaconazole. The patient remained afebrile 
without any signs of infection. She was observed off of 
antibiotics for 24 hours and remained hemodynamically stable and 
afebrile.
.
On the first day after admission, the patient endorsed 
difficulty walking with leaning over to the right side. She also 
had headaches in the morning which resolved with oxycodone. On 
her second hospital day, the patient returned to baseline 
without difficulty walking. There was suspicion that the seizure 
could have been related to her recent sinus surgery, though 
neurology felt that it was unlikely given her benign CSF and 
normal MRI. The headaches resolved. She will continue on Keppra 
1000 mg BID and followup with neurology within one month.
.  
#Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia with blast crisis s/p allogeneic 
SCT in ___ (Day +174): The patient is currently in 
remission. She continued her bactrim, acyclovir, ursodiol, 
posaconazole, cellcept and prednisone during this admission. 
.

improved with a normal saline bolus. Likely pre-renal in 
etiology.

IMAGING: 
========

___ CXR 
Low lung volumes with at least moderate pulmonary edema.  More 
focal opacities 
in the lung bases could reflect atelectasis however infection is 
not excluded 
in the correct clinical setting. 

CT TORSO WITH CONTRAST 
___  
1. Gallbladder wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding is 
similar to 
that seen on ___ and is concerning for 
cholecystitis.  A 
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is appropriately positioned 
within the 
gallbladder. 
2. Filling defects in the right lower lobar and right upper lobe 
pulmonary 
artery are highly suspicious for pulmonary emboli.  If it will 
change clinical 
management, may consider dedicated CTA chest for more detailed 
evaluation. 
3. Consolidation in the bilateral lower lung lobes are increased 
from ___ and may represent atelectasis or infection.  Please 
correlate 
with clinical status. 
4. Endotracheal tube tip terminates in the proximal right 
mainstem bronchus.  
Recommend withdrawing approximately 3 cm for more optimal 
positioning. 
5. Re-demonstration of diffuse chronic changes secondary to 
patient's 
underlying Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber and CLOVE syndromes. 

CTA ABD & PELVIS 
___  
1. No evidence of active GI or other hemorrhage.  Several areas 
of vascular 
ectasia seen within the bowel wall, most prominent at the 
splenic flexure, 
though there is no evidence of active bleed in these areas, 
though there 
remain a potential source for bleed. 
2. No other interval change from the CT scan performed 14 hours 
earlier.  
Please refer to the earlier report for details. 

TTE 
___ 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No masses or vegetations are 
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to 
suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral 
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image 
quality. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be 
determined. 

 IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular 
systolic function. Mild aortic valve sclerosis. No vegetations 
or pathologic regurgitation identified.  

CTA CHEST  
___  
1. Segmental right lower lobe pulmonary embolism without 
evidence of right 
heart strain or pulmonary infarction. 
2. Slight interval increase in small left pleural effusion with 
associated 
atelectasis. 
3. Otherwise stable chronic changes related to underlying 
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber and CLOVES syndromes. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a complicated past 
medical history including Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber and CLOVES 
syndrome, COPD on home 2L O2, insulin dep. T2DM, dCHF, c diff 
colitis, CKD, MDR UTIs, Asthma, OSA (does not tolerate CPAP), 
complex renal/urologic history notable for bladder obstruction 
from lymphatic malformations, and PE s/p IVC filter removal and 
on home xarelto, with recent admission for sepsis due to 
cholecystitis s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy, who presented 
with altered mental status, sepsis, and hypercarbic respiratory 
failure.

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
==============

#Septic Shock 
Patient presented in septic shock, with altered mental status 
and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring pressors and 
intubation. Blood cultures grew coag negative staph (staph 
hominis) and group C strep. Skin source of infection was 
suspected, with multiple skin lesions on exam. Other sources 
considered included biliary given recent cholecystitis, urinary, 
pulmonary. He received vanc (___), zosyn (___), 
daptomycin (___), before ultimately transitioning to 
only vancomycin (___) based on blood culture sensitivities. 
TTE was done showing no vegetations. The patient had a PICC line 
placed prior to discharge. He is planned to finish vancomycin on 
___. Vancomycin dosing was adjusted on day of discharge 
for supratherapeutic trough of 24.9 (1500 mg Q8H to 1250 mg 
Q8H). Please recheck vancomycin level before morning dose 
___.

#GI bleed
#Anemia
On arrival in the ED, the patient had large maroon colored bowel 
movement, with an apparent acute drop in hemoglobin to 7.6, from 
9.1 on ___. He was transfused a total 3U pRBC. CTA abdomen 
pelvis showed no evidence of active bleeding. GI was consulted 
and deferred scoping, as his GI bleed stabilized, and he has 
known vascular malformations throughout the colon due to his 
underlying CLOVES with a history of prior GI bleeding. By 
discharge, H/H was stable and he had not had further blood BMs. 
Should have CBC rechecked ___. Discharge 
Hemoglobin 9.0. Sister/HCP expressed concerns that patient 
should have CBC monitored on a weekly basis given that he has 
required blood transfusions on recent hospitalizations. 
 
#Hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
The patient was intubated and sedated for hypercarbic 
respiratory failure in the ED with VBG showing pCO2 71. The 
cause of his respiratory failure was thought to be 
multifactorial and secondary to hypoventilation from toxic 
metabolic encephalopathy, with contribution from pulmonary 
edema.  He was extubated shortly afterward, and was returned to 
his home 2L NC. 

#PE 
CT chest ___ showed suggestion of RLL PE, with CTA chest ___ 
showing segmental RLL PE that appeared new, or potentially acute 
on chronic. He was started on a heparin gtt. His home 
rivaroxaban had been held upon admission ___, given his GI 
bleeding. Heme/onc was consulted for guidance regarding 
anticoagulation, and per recs he was transitioned to heparin gtt 
back to rivaroxaban, at therapeutic dosing 20 mg daily for 1 
month before returning to his pre-hospital dose of 10 mg daily. 
Records indicated that he had an IVC filter for previous DVT/PE 
but per review of imaging and patient history he did not have an 
IVC filter in place. He should have heme/onc followup, scheduled 
for ___.

# C. diff infection 
The patient had C. diff colitis during his last admission 
___. He was c diff PCR positive this admission and continued 
on PO vancomycin, with planned course to end on ___. 

# Hematuria 
Patient reports intermittent hematuria at baseline, in the 
setting of CLOVES. He has known lymphatic and vascular 
malformations in the bladder, leading to bladder outlet 
obstructions and hematuria. He had hematuria this admission 
without clots that had resolved by discharge. He had a foley 
catheter that was discontinued and had acute urinary retention 
but refused straight cath and bladder scans despite discussion 
at length regarding the risks of urinary retention. He was 
voiding spontaneously by discharge. Continued home tamsulosin.

# Medication reconciliation
Numerous inconsistencies in rehab medication list vs outpatient 
filled prescriptions. Patient was able to discuss some but not 
all of his medications. Numerous medications held in the 
hospital due to initial respiratory failure/somnolence but can 
slowly be restarted. List below.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 

# Cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy
From previous hospitalization ___, evaluated upon admission, 
cholecystostomy tube in correct position and draining well, low 
concern for cholangitis though noted to have elevated bilirubin 
which normalized, however Alk Phos continued to rise, peaked at 
250, discharge Alk Phos 237. Please recheck LFTs ___. 
Needs followup surgery appointment scheduled for consideration 
of removing biliary drain. He should be seen in about 2 weeks 
after discharge for a cholangiogram and have an appointment with 
Dr. ___ the drain later that day. Please call to 
schedule.

# Chronic diastolic heart failure
BNP 665 on admission. Home diuretics were initially held in the 
setting of sepsis and GIB. Home furosemide 40 BID was restarted 
on discharge. Previously prescribed 5mg metolazone three times 
weekly in ___ but not on most current med list from 
rehab. Consider restarting metolazone as an outpatient if not 
achieving adequate volume. Home metoprolol and statin were 
continued. 

# T2DM 
He was maintained on standing and sliding scale insulin, 
decreased from pre-admission regimen to Glargine 23u BID plus 
sliding scale. Blood sugar was generally well controlled.

# COPD on 2L NC: continued Tiotropium bromide cap, held 
budesonide-formoterol, should be restarted on discharge. 

# Chronic pain: continued home MS contin and PRN oxycodone. Held 
nortriptyline, desipramine, gabapentin, tizanidine due to 
concern for sedation. Pain seemed well controlled on MS ___ 
and oxycodone. Please restart nortriptyline and desipramine 
standing, restart gabapentin 2 days after discharge if not 
oversedated. Restarting tizanidine PRN on discharge.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued Levothyroxine Sodium 125 mcg PO/NG 
DAILY

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure to care for you at ___ 
___. 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED? 
- You had confusion and difficulty breathing. 
- You had a bloody stool. 

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN THE HOSPITAL? 
- You initially required care in the ICU because you were 
intubated to help your breathing, and you needed IV medication 
to keep your blood pressure up. 
- You improved quickly and were able to be extubated and 
transferred out of the ICU. 
- You had an infection in the blood, that likely came originally 
from a skin source. You were treated with IV antibiotics. 
- You received blood transfusions because you were anemic, 
likely because of bleeding from the gut. 
- You received imaging that showed you had a blood clot in the 
lung (PE). 
- You were started on an IV blood thinner medication (heparin) 
to treat your PE, then transitioned back to your xarelto, which 
you should take at a higher dose for one month.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ON DISCHARGE? 
- Please continue to take all your medications as prescribed. 
- You will need to complete a total 2-week course of IV 
antibiotics.

We wish you the best, 
Your ___ team

Findings are in keeping with a healing fracture.  No definite 
evidence of osteomyelitis.  No subcutaneous gas. 

___ CHEST (PA & LAT)
IMPRESSION: The heart remains enlarged and there is unfolding 
and prominence to the aorta.  There are subtle patchy opacities 
at both lung bases which may represent atelectasis in the 
setting of somewhat diminished lung volumes, although an early 
pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH significant for ESRD on HD, DM2 who presents with 
worsening L ___ toe cellulitis.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Left ___ toe cellulitis: Superimposed on ___ left metatarsal 
laceration sustained 2 weeks prior to admission. Was seen in 
podiatry office and received stitches for the laceration. Wound 
did not heal properly and stitches fell out per patient. Wound 
culture taken at outpatient podiatry office eventually grew out 
Serratia. He was sent to ___ for evaluation and initiation of 
abx by his outpatient podiatrist. He was initially started on IV 
clindamycin and zosyn. Xray in Atrius records and on ___ with 
no sign of osteo. ABIs in the 0.8-0.9 range but study 
complicated by calcification of the vasculature. Blood cultures 
were negative. Went for angiogram of LLE with vascular which 
showed poor flow distally with presence of collaterals. Both 
vascular and podiatry agreed that the toe would likely not heal 
on its own given poor blood supply. He went to the OR for left 
___ toe and partial metatarsal amputation on ___. Tissue 
culture intraoperatively grew out Serratia as well sensistive to 
Augmentin. He was transitioned to PO Augmentin and completed a 
full 10 day course in house. He also received daily dry dressing 
changes. Patient was concerned that part of the wound was 
opening up and vascular surgery came by to assess the wound. 
They felt his wound was appropriately intact. On the day of 
discharge, his dressing was changed and there was no evidence of 
purulent drainage from the incision.

#A. fib: Chronic with a CHADS2 score of 4. Taking coumadin 3mg 
at home. Rate controlled without nodal agents. INR initially 
supratherapeutic to 6.3. Coumadin was held and INR eventually 
trended down to 2.7 after VitK on ___. We continued to hold 
his coumadin for his angiogram done on ___ and for his 
amputation on ___. He was bridged in the interim with 
heparin gtt per protocol. Coumadin was restarted immediately 
post-op and remained at the 1.4 to 1.5 range at time of 
discharge to ___. He continued to be 
bridged with a heparin gtt for subtherapeutic INR based on ___ 
protocol. His PTT remained therapeutic throughout. Pt will be 
discharged to the ___ with coumadin 7.5mg and heparin gtt. He 
should get daily INRs and q6hrs PTT for drip management.  

#Hyperkalemia: Resolved at time of discharge. He was initially 
hyperkalemic in the ED. This resolved while patient was in the 
ED and remained normal throughout the rest of his 
hospitalization. He receives HD MWF. Potassium on discharge was 
5.0. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#DMII: Patient remained clinically stable on Lantus 5 units at 
bedtime and ISS with humalog. Complicated by ESRD and peripheral 
neuropathy. We continued his home topiramate for his neuropathy. 
He is to continue this regimen at ___.
 
#ESRD on HD: Patient remained clinically stable in house. He has 
a L AVF for access and received dialysis ___. He should 
continue to get HD at the ___. He was continued on nephrocaps 
and calcium acetate on the floor. He was given paricalcitol on 
his HD days. Weight at discharge was 86.1kg (189.8 lbs).
 
#Anemia: Patient remained clinically stable while in the 
hospital. Likely ___ chronic disease and ESRD. He did not 
require any blood products during this admission.
 
#Peptic ulcer disease: Patient remained clinically stable on 
home pantoprazole. He should continue this medication at home.  
 
#dHF: Patient remained clinically stable in house. Overall, he 
was euvolemic with BP at baseline of SBP ___.
 
#H/o orthostatic hypotension: Patient remained clinically 
stable. BP stable in 80-90s systolic which is this patient's 
baseline. Patient did have one episode of dizziness upon 
standing with a normal blood pressure and HR which resolved with 
lying down and receiving IVFs. He had no further episodes of 
orthostasis. He was continued on his home midodrine 10mg TID. 
 
#Gout: Patient remained clinically stable on home allopurinol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
**Will need q6hr PTT for heparin gtt management 
**Will need daily INRs for coumadin management
**Will need daily weights, if patient gains more than 3lbs 
please call MD. --> PATIENT DOES NOT MAKE URINE, he is dependent 
on dialysis for fluid offloading. Weight at discharge was 86.1kg 
(189.8 lbs).

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ w/ h/o pancreatic cancer s/p whipple and 
currently on gemzar w/ recent ___ admitted to ___ for workup 
of delirium. A full delirium workup was completed. An MRI head 
did not show any acute abnormalities. Urine was clean. 
Electrolytes were within normal limits. Vitamin B12 was 
elevated. TSH was low, but thyroid hormones were WNL. RPR was 
negative. An LP was performed which was clear, and an HSV PCR 
was sent off and came back negative.

Psychiatry was asked to see the patient. They discussed several 
possibilities including opiate induced delirium, benzo 
withdrawal, ___ body dementia. The patient stopped taking 
oxycondone 2 days before admission. Although opiates can stay in 
the system for a time after stopping them, this is not likely 
the cause. The patient had taken oxycodone in the past and 
tolerated the medication well. She is older, and older patients 
are more sensitive to opiates though. She is taking klonopin and 
recently had the dose decreased by her psychiatrist. It seems 
like the decrease was reasonable, and should not have caused 
withdrawal. Another possibility is ___ body dementia. One of 
the presenting symptoms is visual hallucinations, but several 
other symptoms usually coincide including cognitive fluctuations 
and spontaneous extrapyramidal signs. The patient did not 
display any of these other symptoms making the diagnosis less 
likely. This diagnosis is made clinically and in the abscence of 
more presenting symptoms difficult to make for this admission.

The patient was pre-emptively started on acyclovir for presumed 
HSV infection. The patient was well hydrated while receiving 
this medication. Once the HSV PCR came back negative the 
acyclovir was stopped.

At the time of discharge the patient's symptoms have resolved, 
and actually did not occur during the hospitalization. Although 
a definitive cause was not determined, the patient is otherwise 
stable and ready to go home with ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for further workup of your altered 
mental status. Several studies were done during your stay. An 
MRI of your head did not show any acute intracranial process 
which could account for your changes. Your labwork was also

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the MICU for hypoxia.  He was on 6L NC.  He 
was febrile and a CXR and Chest CT were concerning for 
hemorrhage, infection or fluid.  He was treated boradly with 
antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) and cultures were sent.  
He improved dramatically with dialysis and resultant fluid 
removal.  He was weaned down to 2L nasal canula.  A Bronch was 
discussed but as he was improving it was felt that he could have 
a bronch outside the ICU where brushings could be done.  He 
spiked a temp to 101 in the ICU.  His ICU course was complicated 
by a-fib with RVR while on HD.  He was treated with IV and PO 
betablocker.  

On transfer to the floor, he was stable and breathing 
comfortably on 2 L oxygen with continued hemoptysis improved in 
terms of quantity.  He was continued on PO metoprolol 100 mg tid 
for Afib.  Coumadin and aspirin were initially held after 
discussion with PCP and cardiologist Dr. ___.  He was seen by 
pulmonary who decided against a bronch given improving 
hemoptysis and recommended PO levofloxacin  for total ABX of 10 
day duration given likely infectious etiology of hemoptysis. 
They also approved restarting anticoagulation.  During his 
hospital stay, he remained afebrile with normal WBC.  For his 
end stage renal disease, he received dialysis.  He got dialysis 
on ___.

For his Afib, we will discharge on metoprolol succinate 300 mg 
daily  We will ask him to hold amlodipine, to be re-started at 
discretion of PCP/cardiologist.  We will start him on warfarin 
2.5 mg daily, with INR check on ___ and f/u 
appointment with PCP on ___ at which time warfarin 
dosing can be re-adjusted.  His aspirin was also restarted.

We recommend a f/u x-ray as an outpatient in 8 weeks.  We also 
recommend referral by his PCP to ___ pulmonologist for f/u .

2. Unchanged cirrhosis and ascites. 
 
___ CXR PA & LAT - IMPRESSION: Large left pneumothorax.
 
___ CXR - FINDINGS: There has been little change in the 
appearance of the thorax since ___. A left-sided 
chest tube remains in unchanged position with no evidence of 
pneumothorax. There may have been minimal clearing of the left 
lower lobe atelectasis. The contour of the azygos vein is 
prominent, particularly given the upright positioning suggestive 
of volume overload without frank pulmonary edema. The gaseous 
distention of the stomach has resolved since the previous study, 
but now mildly prominent loops of bowel are noted in the upper 
abdomen. 
 
___ Chest CT with contrast - IMPRESSION: 
1. Compared to a ___ study of ___, and the ___ 
study of

splanchnic thrombus, now occluding the left and right portal 
veins. There is also focal thrombus within the dilated SMV at 
the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV, however, remains 
patent. Additionally, there has been an increase in ascites. 
2. Signs of portal hypertension including intra-abdominal, 
paraesophageal 
varices and splenomegaly. 
3. Chronic findings including some small bowel thickening 
(likely related to ascites and venous congestion from splanchnic 
thrombus) and uncomplicated cholelithiasis. 
 
___ ECHO - The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due 
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. Tricuspid regurgitation is 
present but cannot be quantified. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 
No vegetation seen (cannot exclude).  
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ yo F w/cirrhosis ___ UC/PSC, severe LGIB 
___ UC, h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated 
hepatic failure and anemia, found to have large left 
pneumothorax with concern for progression to tension PTX 
prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT placement.    
 
On arrival to the medical floor she was noted to be hypoxic 
88%RA, which was new per discharge summary from the OSH.  She 
had a CXR to further evaluate her hypoxia which showed large 
left hydropneumothorax in the setting of recent line placement 
concerning hemopneumothorax, complete collapse of the left lung, 
and new right effusion.  In addition she had abdominal 
ultrasound on admission given her new hepatic decompensation, 
which showed new portal vein thrombosis.  CT surgery was 
consulted for chest tube placement.  She was also started on 
vancomycin for report of ___ blood culture bottle drawn from 
subclavian line with GPC, peripheral blood culture still with no 
growth.  Prior to chest tube placement she was given vitamin K 
10mg po x1, 5 units FFP, 2 units PRBC, 2 bags platelets to 
reverse her coagulopathy.    
  
While on the floor she acutely decompensated with HR up to 150's 
and hypotension.  She was given 1L IVF bolus and transferred to 
ICU for stat chest tube placement ___ concern for possible 
tension pneumothorax.  She did well post chest tube placement 
with post xray showing re-expansion of her left lung.  She did 
have an episode of hypotension following chest tube placement 
likely ___ acute reexpansion of her left lung.  

MICU course:
 
#Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - Most likely secondary to 
portal vein thrombosis seen on RUQ ultrasound on admission.  
Unfortunately given her severe LGIB secondary to ulcerative 
colitis the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation.  
SBP was also considered in the differential, but paracentesis 
could not be performed because of low platelets so she was 
intially treated empirically with ceftriaxone then switched to 
cefipime (day #1 = ___ for broader coverage.  She is not a 
transplant candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Per 
hepatology even if the patient recovers from bactermia and DIC, 
she is unlikely to be a transplant candidate in the future.  
 
She had waxing and waning mental status while in the MICU.  At 
times A&O x3, but usually oriented just to person and place (not 
date).  She continued to receive lactulose, but some doses were 
held due to extensive stooling with lots of blood.  She was 
continued on rifaxamin and ursodiol
 
# Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver 
disease and consistent with DIC/sepsis.  The patient was given a 
single dose of Neupogen.  Hematology was consulted.  Peripheral 
smear with schisocytes and several other types of dysmorphic 
RBCs.  Her platelets dropped to 13 in setting of an acute bleed. 
 She was transfused 1 unit of platelets.  The following day she 
received 1 unit of platelets and 2U of PRBC.  Her platelets 
subsequently dropped again to 16 and she was given FFP x2 units 
and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  At one 
point she was bleeding from both her foley and chest tube in 
addition to her rectum, but the former resolved and her DIC labs 
improved.  Currently she continues to have melena/BRBPR 
intermittantly, but no other bleeding.  She received her last 
unit of platelets on ___ before family decided the patient 
would receive no further blood products.  Serial hematocrits and 
other labs were also stopped per family wishes.  
 
# MRSA bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from 
CVL is positive.  Culture here positive for MRSA in ___ bottles. 
 Her line was changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although 
pleural fluid had many WBCs and coag+ Staph. aureus as well. 
Skin exam shows no focus for bacteremia, although the patient 
has a history of MRSA skin infections.  The primary source of 
her bacteremia is unclear.  ECHO did not show any vegetations on 
her heart valves.  She was started on vancomycin on ___ for a 
14 day course.  
 
#Pneumothorax - most likely developed slowly following placement 
of a left subclavian line at the OSH and likely progressed to 
cause hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and 
hypotension on the floor.  She had a chest tube placed  with 
post procedure x-ray showing reexpansion of her left lung.  
Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax, but chest tube was sealed 
while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no pneumothorax. 
 
#Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - Early on in admission she had 
been going in and out PAF with rate up to 150's, BP stable since 
CT placed.  PAF resolved with IVF.  Initially rate controlling 
agents were held given episodic hypotension and GI bleeding.  
When she became hemodynamically more stable low dose metoprolol 
was added.  
 
#. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite 
steroid treatment. She recently finished a course of 
cipro/flagyl as inpt/oupt.  She was recently treated with 
remicaid on ___ followed by prednisone.  She is now on stress 
dose hydrocortisone.  Mesalamine was stopped per hepatology 
recommendations and remicade and ___ were also held.

Plan:
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service and transferred to the 
Trauma ICU where he remained vented and sedated. He underwent 
tracheostomy on ___ secondary to failure to wean. On ___ he 
was noted with right upper extremity swelling and underwent an 
ultrasound which revealed partial nonocclusive thrombus in one 
of the paired right brachial veins and occlusive thrombus in the 
right basilic vein. Anticoagulation was initiated. 

Neurosurgery was consulted for his head injuries and for the 
colloid brain cyst noted on CT and MRI imaging. He was taken to 
the operating room on ___ for craniotomy and resection of 
colloid cyst.

On ___ Infectious Disease was consulted for persistent fevers 
and leukocytosis. He was cultured and underwent a BAL and was 
treated for pneumonia with Vancomycin, Cipro, and cefepime.

He was eventually weaned off of the ventilator and transferred 
to the regular nursing unit. He began working with Physical and 
Occupational therapy who were recommending rehab after his acute 
hospital stay.

On ___ he was then taken to the operating room for pancreatic 
cyst gastrostomy and placement of gastrojejunal feeding tube. 
His tube feeds were started and increased to goal.  

On ___ he was noted to have increased secretions, tachypneic 
and to have an elevated WBC count and falling hematocrit. He was 
transferred back to the Trauma ICU and underwent another BAL and 
an EGD. His antibiotics were changed to treat the pneumonia; 
Vancomycin, Flagyl and Cipro were started. These will continue 
for another 7 days post discharge.

He was evaluated on ___ by Speech and Swallow for Passy Muir 
valve for which he was able to tolerate for short periods. 
Because his mental status has waxed and waned it was difficult 
to assess his swallowing. He is currently much more awake and it 
is being recommended that he have ongoing Speech evaluation once 
at rehab to determine his readiness for an oral diet. For now he 
will remain NPO and continue with tube feedings.

Postop, urine output declined. The catheter was flushed without 
increased urine output. A renal U/S was done showing a small 
perinephric fluid collection superior to the renal transplan. 
Vasculature was patent and there was no hydronephrosis. 
Creatinine trended up and urine output was minimal. 

Dialysis was done on ___ for delayed graft function. Potassium 
was 6.1 pre-dialysis. He experienced a hct drop to 18.9. This 
was verified with a repeat hct of 18. An abdominal/pelvis CT was 
done revealing a the transplant kidney surrounded by a right 
perinephric hematoma extending superiorly as a right 
retroperitoneal 
hematoma. There was no evidence of hydronephrosis. The epicenter

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Patient admitted because he was found 
to be encephalopathic in the setting of medication 
non-compliance. His NGT had clogged about 3 days prior to 
admission and he stopped taking his medications. He was treated 
with lactulose PR on the day of admission and his mental status 
improved. On HD 2 his mental status was back to his baseline and 
he was switched to PO lactulose. He had a diagnostic 
paracentesis performed that ruled out SBP, urine and blood 
cultures were negative for infection. RUQ U/S did not reveal a 
new liver process and the vasculature was found to be patent. 
His NGT was replaced by ___ and he was re-started on tube feeds. 
He had no more episodes of confusion during his hospitalization.

#. Acute renal failure: Patient's Cr was found to be 2.7 
(baseline 1.5-1.7) on admission. This was thought to be due to 
pre-renal azotemia in the setting of the patient being 
dehydrated and not eating appropriately since his NGT clogged 
and he was encephalopathic. He was treated with hydration and 
his renal function rapidly improved. His Cr was 2.0 on the day 
of discharge. 

#. Anemia: Patient was found to be anemic on admission with a 
Hct of 22.7. His baseline Hct runs in the low ___ range but on 
HD 2 his Hct was 17.8. He had no overt bleed and remained 
asymptomatic.  He was transfused 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
responded appropriately. His Hct was 22.6 on discharge which is 
around his baseline.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted because you were found to be confused in the 
setting of your feeding tube being clogged and you not taking 
your medication as prescribed.  We re-started you on your 
lactulose and rifaxamin and your confusion improved.  We also 
replaced your clogged feeding tube so you can continue to 
receive tube feedings and medications while you are at home.  As 
a consecuence of you not taking your medications and not eating 
propertly because your tube was clogged your kidney function 
worsened transiently.  We hydrated you and gave you medications 
and this is now back to your normal state. While in the hospital 
you were found to be anemic, more so than your normal, and you 
were transfused 2 units of red blood cells.  This made your 
blood count go back to your baseline.
If you start feeling sleepy or confused, dizzy, light headed, 
have any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath or your 
abdomen becomes very tense please call the GI offices or come to 
the emergency room for futher evaluation.

monitoring.
.
1. Post-TACE Monitoring: The patient had hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) presumably from a combination of his Hepatitis C 
Virus infection and history of alcohol abuse. After completion 
of the TACE procedure the patient was transferred to the OMED 
service for monitoring. The patient remained pain free 
throughout the admission but did have some nausea that was 
controlled with anti-emetics. The patient's liver enzymes were 
monitored throughout admission. His AST, ALT, total bilirubin 
were within normal limits at time of transfer, became elevated 
on day two of admission but were trending back down at the time 
of discharge. A CT scan of the abdomen the day following the 
procedure demonstrated post-TACE changes but no concerning 
abnormalities. The patient became febrile to 101.2 the night 
following his procedure and Ciprofloxacin was started in 
addition to Unasyn, which is typically given for four doses 
post-TACE. The remainder of the post-TACE protocol was followed 
without event. The patient was discharged home with instructions 
to follow up with his outpatient Oncologist. 
.
2. ESLD: Stable. The patient was maintained on his regular home 
medications which included Lasix. The patient also received 
Nadolol for prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Lactulose was 
administered and the patient never produced signs of hepatic 
encephalopathy. 
.
3. Hypertension: The patient was normotensive throughout 
admission. His home anti-hypertensives, Lisinopril and 
Amiloride, were continued throughout his stay.

separation from bypass but it did not result in an outflow tract 
obstruction and had resolved completely after euvolemia was 
established. There is at least trace and likely mild, resultant 
mitral stenosis. The peak gradient across the mitral valve was 
18 mmHg and the mean about 11 mmHg but at a high cardiac output

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was a same day admit and on ___ he was brought to 
the operating room where he underwent a Minimally-invasive 
mitral valve repair with a #28 mm ___ Future ring. Please see 
operative note for surgical details. Following surgery he was 
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable 
condition. Within several hours he was weaned from sedation, 
awoke neurologically intact and extubated.He briefly required 
pressor support with Neo. He weaned off of Neo and was started 
on low dose Beta-blocker and ASA. Postoperatively he was 
transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for anemia likely secondary to volume 
resuscitation. POD#1 his chest tubes were discontinued. A right 
pneumothorax resulted. The pt then had a pigtail placed and 
there was resolution of the pneumothorax. He transferred to the 
step down unit for further monitoring. The pigtail was placed to 
water seal and a CXR was done. No evidence of pneumothorax. 
POD#3 his pigtail was discontinued without incident. Repeat CXR 
revealed clear lungs. Echocardiogram performed showed no 
pericardial effusion in the setting of hypotension secondary to 
hypovolemia in setting of large diuresis. Physical Therapy was 
consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility. He was 
repeatedly orthostatic while working with physical therapy this 
recovered by the time of discharge on POD 6.By the time of his 
discharge his incisions were healing well and he was ambulating 
without difficulty. He continued to progress and on POD 6 he was 
discharged to home with ___. All follow up appointments were 
advised.

Pertinent Results:
MRI Brain ___.  1.2 cm avidly enhancing intra-axial lesion in the right 
anterior temporal lobe, with significant perilesional edema 
extending to the insula and inferior right frontal lobe.  Given 
the extensive vasogenic edema, differential consideration favors 
high-grade neoplasm.  Intracranial metastasis is also high on 
differential.   
2.  Mass effect with 3-mm leftward shift and mild uncal 
herniation. 

CT Torso
1.  No evidence of malignancy in the chest, abdomen or pelvis. 
2.  Asymmetry of the breast tissues.  If clinically indicated, a 
mammogram 
could be performed for further evaluation. 
3.  An 8-mm right thyroid nodule. Non-urgent ultrasound could be 
performed for further evaluation if not done elsewhere. 
4.  A 3-mm non-obstructing right renal stone. 
5.  Fibroid uterus. IUD in place. 

CTA Head ___
The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are 
patent 
with no evidence of stenosis. There is no evidence of aneurysm 
formation or other vascular abnormality. 

MRI WAND ___
Enhancing lesion in the anterior right temporal lobe as 
described with 
extensive ___ edema suspicious for high-grade glioma.  
 

CT HEad post-op ___
Status post right temporal lesion biopsy without evidence of 
complications. 

MRI BRAIN ___ pre-op resection
No significant interval change of enhancing nodular lesion in 
the anterior 
right temporal lobe with similar surrounding vasogenic edema and 
mass effect when compared to prior.  Expected post biopsy 
changes. 

CT Head ___ post-op
1. Status post right temporal craniotomy with underlying 
temporal lobe 
resection with postsurgical changes including subcutaneous gas 
and 
pneumocephalus.   
2. Increased cerebral edema with sulcal and basal cistern 
effacement   
3. Increased mass effect related to resection site with new 6 mm 
leftward 
shift of midline structures and increased effacement of the 
right lateral 
ventricle.  

MRI Brain ___ post-op
Postsurgical changes along the right temporal lobe without 
evidence of 
residual nodular enhancement.  Residual FLAIR signal 
hyperintensity along the medial temporal lobe with a new area of 
abnormal FLAIR posterior and lateral to surgical cavity with 
associated slow diffusion which could be related to postsurgical 
changes or ischemia.   

Echocardiogram ___
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The diameters of aorta 
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.  


TSH ___: 0.93
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the neuroscience step-down unit on 
the day of admission, ___. She continued on Dexamethasone 
4mg IV QH and Keppra 1,000mg PO BID. A head CTA and CT torso was 
ordered. Radiation oncology and neuro-oncology were consulted. 

The CT of the Torso was negative for any malignancy; an 8mm 
thyroid nodule was noted that will require an US on an 
outpatient basis.

On ___, the patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of the 
right temporal brain mass, which went well without complication. 
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient 
underwent a postoperative CT scan, which revealed no active 
bleeding. Afterwards, the patient was transferred to the floor 
where she remained stable overnight into ___. On ___ she 
udnerwent a WAND study in anticipation of going to the OR on 
___ for resection. 

On ___ she went to the operating room for a right temporal 
craniectomy for resection of intracranial lesion. She toelrated 
the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room, and 
transferred to the ICU post-operatively for observation and 
care. Post op CT scan showed no signs of bleed.  In the evening 
the patient had afib with RVR with HRs up to the 140s.  The 
patient was converted back to NSR overnight after going on a 
dilt drip. 

On ___ the patient continued to progress well in the ICU.  A 
cardiology consult was placed for the afib which recommended an 
echocardiogram, TSH, and starting her on metoprolol 12.5mg BID.  
These recommendations were followed. Her afib subsequently 
resolved. The MRI showed postsurgical changes along the right 
temporal lobe without evidence of residual nodular enhancement.  
Residual FLAIR signal hyperintensity along the medial temporal 
lobe with a new area of abnormal FLAIR posterior and lateral to 
surgical cavity with associated slow diffusion which could be 
related to postsurgical changes or ischemia. The echocardiogram 
was within normal limits. TSH level was normal (0.93).

On ___, the patient was transferred to the floor, and her diet 
was advanced as tolerated. She started to work with physical 
therapy.

___, the patient contintued to progress well on the floor.  
Physical therapy worked with her and fel that she was limited by 
lethargy, and once resolved,
would improve rapidly. Physical therapy felt the patient would 
benefit from another day of physical therapy on an inpatient 
basis. She will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient, but 
should remain on metoprolol. 

On ___, patient was re-evaluated by ___ and determined that she 
needed an additional day to work on stairs. On ___, patient 
received magnesium citrate to help encourage a BM. ___ evaluated 
her and determined she is safe to discharge home with ___. She 
was stable upon discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for alcohol detoxification. We treated you 
with medicines to prevent dangerous withdrawal symptoms and side 
effects.

We also had out social worker and addiction specialists work 
with you to come up with a safe plan for discharge to keep you 
sober.  As you know, it is extremely important that you stop 
drinking to prevent the many terrible effects alcohol can have 
on the body.  As we discussed, this will be difficult, but with 
the proper social supports it is something that you have the 
capability to do.  By continuing to drink, you are only 
increasing the chances of death at a young age.
.
We also tested you for HIV and Hepatitis C, both of which were 
negative.  You had some findings in your mouth that may have 
been thrush (a mild infection), so you should finish 5 days of 
nystatin to treat this.  We have also started you on some 
vitamins, which you should continue to take.
.
Please note the following medication changes:
-Please START thiamine
-Please START multivitamin
-Please START folic acid
-Please START nystatin for 2 more days

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 46-year-old male who was admitted for alcohol withdrawal. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has experienced withdrawal seizures in the past. He drinks 16 drinks of vodka daily and had 6 drinks today, which led to symptoms such as insomnia, seeing flashes of ""demonic faces,"" and dreams of being levitated by devils. He was treated with benzodiazepines and had no further seizures in the hospital. His roommate, who was also an inpatient for detox, left the hospital against medical advice to be with him in the emergency department.

The patient's past medical history includes alcohol abuse with a history of withdrawal seizures, foot surgery, and hand surgery. His family history is significant for alcoholism, with his grandfather and many other family members affected.

The patient's physical examination was notable for poor dentition, thrush on his tongue, and a trace fine tremor. His laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, likely due to fatty deposition in the liver.

The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse and was advised to start outpatient treatment within one week of discharge. He was also prescribed medications including folic acid, multivitamins, thiamine, and nystatin oral suspension. ||endoftext||"

IMAGING

___ ERCP:
IMPRESSION: No dominant stricture was noted in the CBD or CHD.  
No filling defects were noted. The right and left common hepatic 
ducts are markedly narrowed consistent with known PSC. The 
biliary tree was swept with a balloon starting at the 
bifurcation. Scant sludge was removed.

___ MRCP:
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension as 
evidenced by splenomegaly, multiple esophageal and gastric 
varices and a small to moderate amount of ascites.  There are no 
concerning hepatic lesions. 
2.  Irregularity of the intrahepatic ducts appears similar to 
the previous exam.  Progressive enhancement along the biliary 
trees is likely related to combination of fibrosis and chronic 
cholangitis. 3.  Sludge/choledocholithiasis in the distal common 
bile duct. 
4.  There is a small stone in the remnant gallbladder. 
5.  Marrow edema in the ascending colon is nonspecific and may 
be related to portal colopathy or inflammation.  Clinical 
correlation is recommended.

___ CXR:
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Right PICC tip appears to 
been advanced, now terminating within the proximal right atrium.

___: RUQ US
IMPRESSION:
1.  Cirrhotic liver with small amount of ascites and 
splenomegaly.
2.  No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation seen.  
Small amount of hypoechoic material within the common bile duct 
could reflect sludge. 
3.  Re-demonstration of a calculus in the gallbladder remnant.

___: EGD
Findings:
Esophagus:
Excavated Lesions: A single clean base non-bleeding 8 mm ulcer 
was found in the gastroesophageal junction. Other: A 
circumferential scar was identified at the G-E junction into the 
lower third of the esophagus from prior banding. NO evidence of 
esophageal varices Stomach:
Mucosa: Localized mosaic appearance of the mucosa was noted in 
the stomach. These findings are compatible with mild portal 
gastropathy. Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Ulcer in the gastroesophageal junction A 
circumferential scar was identified at the G-E junction into the 
lower third of the esophagus from prior banding. NO evidence of 
esophageal varices
Mosaic appearance in the stomach compatible with mild portal 
gastropathy Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were seen at ___ for your abdominal pain and fevers. Our 
imaging showed some ""sludge"" in your bile duct, which was 
removed during an ERCP procedure. We also switched your 
antibiotics, and you have not had a fever since this change. You 
will need to continue on this new antibiotic, Meropenem, until 
next week. 

You will need to have your blood work checked next week on 
___. We have provided you with a prescription for 
this blood work. Please follow up the results with your PCP or 
at your Hepatology appointment if they are done at ___.

We wish you all the best,

Your ___ team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 53-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and fever. She has a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cirrhosis, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, varices, and possibly Crohn's disease and celiac disease. She was diagnosed with cholangitis during a previous hospitalization and was treated with IV antibiotics. She has also had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and liver biopsy, which showed bile ductular proliferation and early, incomplete nodule formation.

The patient's allergies include Bactrim, Ampicillin, Sulfa, cefuroxime, Gadolinium-Containing Contrast Media, gluten, nadolol, and Pneumovax 23. She has a history of hypertension, GERD, hypothyroidism, and OSA.

During her hospitalization, the patient's symptoms included abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. She was treated with ertapenem and Zofran, and her nausea improved with the latter. Her laboratory results showed slightly elevated liver enzymes, but her chemistry panel and urinalysis were normal.

The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which showed no dominant stricture in the CBD or CHD, but did show marked narrowing of the right and left common hepatic ducts consistent with known PSC. She also underwent an MRCP procedure, which showed cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and multiple esophageal and gastric varices.

At discharge, the patient was prescribed medications including ertapenem and Zofran, and was advised to follow up with her primary care physician. ||endoftext||"

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with past medical
history significant for Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in ___ 
with
recurrences later that year in ___ and ___.  He is status post
full body radiation in ___ and a bone marrow transplant in ___
followed by another round of radiation.  He then developed
squamous cell carcinoma of the left mandible requiring modified
radical neck dissection with resection of the left posterior
mandible followed by a third radiation treatment.  He presented
to neurology clinic last week after CT earlier this year showed
evidence of a frontal stroke.  

Earlier today, Mr ___ called the clinic to report several
concerning episodes over the weekend. On ___, around noon 
he
had 30- 60min of right hand numbness. He has had this sensation
before (maybe ~6x in his life). Occasionally, it has been
associated with weakness where he is unable to keep the hand
lifted up. This time, it was associated with numbness of all the
fingers as well as the palm but no weakness. He also reports a
frontal headache around this time that he treated with Tylenol.
At 3pm, he developed dysarthric speech. He knew what he wanted 
to
say but the words coming out did not sound like the words he was
trying to say. His wife was unable to understand what he was
trying to say until he repeated it several times. This 
completely
resolved within an hour. It was not associated with any other
weakness, numbness, visual problems, or vertigo. Yesterday, he
had a additional episode of right hand numbness (no weakness)
lasting ___ minutes. He reports that he is currently back to
his baseline. He denies any recent illnesses, infections,
intoxications that could explain his symptoms.  He had a full
stoke workup ordered as an outpatient (scheduled to get MRI/MRA
head and neck, carotid ultrasounds next ___, a week from
today) but because of these recent episodes, he was instructed 
to
come to the ED for admission and expedited workup. 

The patient had a long and complicated medical history since his
diagnosis of Hodgkin's when he was ___ most significant for bone
marrow transplant and whole body radiation x 3.   mmediately
after the bone marrow transplant, secondary to immunosuppression
medications, he developed chronic kidney disease. This 
progressed
into fulminant renal failure earlier this year (the exact cause
unknown) requiring the placement of a peritoneal dialysis
catheter in ___.  During the time of his kidney
failure, he developed severe generalized sharp headaches focused
behind his eyes that would last approximately four hours a day
but were relatively well treated with Tylenol and Percocet. 
Those
headaches have since resolved as his metabolic and electrolyte
disturbances have normalized with the use of the PD catheter. 
Earlier this year, in order to workup the severe headaches, he
underwent a CT scan which showed a hypodensity in the left
frontal region. On further questioning, he remembers having a
facial droop in ___ that lasted about a month. In addition, he
and his wife describe an episode of an abnormal heart rhythm
during his hospitalization in ___ as SVT) which was
associated with negative CE and unchanged EKG. During that
hospitalization, he had CT Head which did not show the lesion
leading us to believe that it occurred some time in the last
___ years although we are unable to determine a more exact
date.  He comes to clinic today for recommendations for further
workup of this finding as well as secondary prevention
recommendations.

Review of Systems:  Positive for headaches earlier this year
which have almost entirely resolved, generalized numbness and
weakness which has since resolved; chronic muscle cramps; easy
fatigability; vertigo/nausea with any abrupt changes in his PD
catheter which has since resolved; chronic speaking and
swallowing difficulties related to his radical neck dissection;
chronic insomnia; difficulty with maintaining his weight since
his initial diagnosis.  He denies loss of vision, blurred 
vision,
diplopia, hearing difficulty.  He reports difficulty of gait
secondary to his gout. 

On general review of systems, he denies recent fever or chills. 
No night sweats.  Denies cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
tightness, palpitations.  Had intermittent nausea and vomiting
with his headaches and when his PD catheter malfunctions, but
otherwise this seems to have resolved.  Chronic myalgias since
his bone marrow transplant.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right hand numbness, 
difficulty speaking, and headache resulting from an ACUTE 
ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing 
oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The 
brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the 
other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being 
deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of 
symptoms. 

We incidentally found aneurysms in your MCAs which should be 
evaluated by Neurosurgery in outpatient clinic. Please call 
tomorrow to make an appointment in their clinic.
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
History of Radiation and Cancer 
High Cholesterol 
High Blood pressure 

We are changing your medications as follows:  
1. START Aspirin 81mg daily 
2. START Atorvastatin 10mg at bedtime  
3. START Amlodipine 5 mg daily 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Neurology Team

nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and epigastric abdominal pain.

# Nausea
# NB-NB Vomiting
# NB Diarrhea
Patient reported acute onset nausea, vomiting, diarrhea 
concerning for viral gastroenteritis. He was thought to be high 
risk of norovirus given immunosuppressed state and time of year. 
His abdominal examination was nonsurgical and his emesis was 
nonbloody which was reassuring. Patient reported that he was 
currently tolerating sips on admission but exam and lab findings 
showed evidence of dehydration and the patient received 3 L of 
IV fluid. His lipase was found to be normal. Several stool 
studies including C. difficile, neurovirus, stool culture, CMV, 
and CMV viral load were sent given patient's immunocompromised 
state and history of CMV colitis in the past. He was given 
ondansetron as needed for nausea. A right upper quadrant 
ultrasound was reassuring and did not show any new abnormal 
findings. Nutrition was consulted to help provide appropriate 
recommendations. The patient was placed on contact and GI 
precautions and his labs are monitored closely. His home 
medications were continued except his loperamide and tincture of 
opium were held due to concern of infection with plans to 
restart if his cultures were negative. Overall, his diarrhea 
returned to baseline ___ bowel movements daily and he was able 
to tolerate PO intake.

# ___ on CKD
On admission, patients Cr was 1.5, above reported baseline in 
recent hepatology notes at 1.1. However, all creatinine values 
in OMR from the last year ranged between 1.52. His kidney 
function was closely monitored with daily labs.

# Influenza B positive
Patient was noted to be influenza B positive in the emergency 
department. He reported no respiratory symptoms. Given his 
immunosuppressed state, he was started on treatment with a 10 
day course of Tamiflu (___), at a renally dosed 30mg BID 
with plans to escalate dose if renal function improved.

# H/o EtOH cirrhosis s/p OLT ___
On presentation, patient's LFTs were found to be at baseline. He 
also reported being compliant with medications. He was continued 
on mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg twice daily and prednisone 5 mg 
daily.

# Chronic diarrhea
On presentation, the patient patient reported approximately 10 
bowel movements daily daily for the past 2 days, above his 
preadmission baseline. An infection workup was undertaken as 
described above and his home loperamide and opium tincture were 
held due to concern of infection until cultures were negative.

# Chronic back pain
He was continued on home lidocaine patch, oxycontin, and 
hydromorphone.

# Malnutrition
The patient was followed by transplant nutrition on an 
outpatient basis. He was currently G-tube dependent for 
supplemental food. On admission, and nutrition was consulted to 
provide further recommendations while the patient was admitted. 
Initially, tube feeds were not started through his G-tube as the 
patient is very nauseous and was thought to not tolerate any 
type of supplemental feeding. He was started as an sips with 
instructions to advance diet as tolerated. His nutrition needs 
were reassessed daily.

IMAGING/STUDIES
=====================================
TTE ___:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed 
(LVEF = 15 %). The estimated cardiac index is depressed 
(<2.0L/min/m2). The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated 
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular 
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, 
posterolaterally directed jet of severe (4+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid 
regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] 
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased 
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
multiple severe abnormalities of cardiac structure and function, 
as described in detail in the prior report, persist without 
major change.  

EP CRT report: Upgrade from a dual chamber to BiV ICD. New LV 
lead ___ quadrupolar implanted in the posterolateral
branch of CS. Pocket modified. DEvice exchanged to a BiV ICD. No 
complications.

CXR PA/LAT ___ IMPRESSION: 
1. Left pectoral AICD with three leads following the expected 
course to the right atrium, right ventricle and left ventricle.  
No pneumothorax. 
2. Minimally improved bibasilar atelectasis. 
3. Mild diffuse interstitial opacities, anomaly at the lung 
bases, may reflect 
chronic interstitial lung disease or chronic mild pulmonary 
edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with history significant 
for dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 15%, 
single-vessel coronary artery disease s/p DES to the RCA in 
___, s/p primary prevention dual chamber ICD, severe functional 
mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, 
insulin-dependent diabetes, CKD w/ bl Cr ~1.5, PAD s/p bilateral 
iliac artery stenting, and CAD s/p DESx1 to RCA in ___ and 
right carotid endarterectomy who presented with weight gain and 
progressive shortness of breath.
 
 # Acute exacerbation of chronic HFrEF (LVEF 15%): 
He has a history of idiopathic, dilated non-ischemic 
cardiomyopathy. He presented with 3 weeks of weight gain, 
peripheral edema, and dyspnea on exertion concerning for volume 
overload. Dry weight: 144lbs, up to 158lbs on admission. This 
was likely precipitated by dietary indiscretion, but cannot 
exclude valvular heart disease, tachyarrythmia, or MI given 
history. He was diuresed with IV Lasix boluses of 120mg and gtt 
at 10. For afterload reduction, he was continued on home imdur 
and hydralazine, which was increased to 20 mg TID. No ACE 
inhibitor due to history of hyperkalemia. For neurohormonal 
blockade, spironolactone was discontinued in the past given 
hyperkalemia, and metoprolol was also held due to low cardiac 
index. Once he approached euvolemia, he was transitioned to 
torsemide 10 mg daily. EP was consulted for up grade to CRT 
given ___ class III symptoms, conduction delay on EKG, and 
multiple HF admissions. CRT upgrade was done on ___. 
Patient will finish 7 days of gram positive antibiotic coverage 
(Keflex TID on discharge) on ___.   

 # Coronary artery disease with T2 NSTEMI: 
He is status post drug-eluting stent to the RCA in ___. No 
chest pain to suggest ischemic etiology due to heart failure 
exacerbation. Troponin of 0.07 likely demand ischemia in the 
setting of acute HF exacerbation. Continued on ASA 81 and 
atorvastatin 80.

 # Insulin-dependent type II diabetes  
___ was consulted. He was continued on home Tresiba 12 units 
qAM, which was uptitrated to 14 U qAM during admission. He has 
labile blood sugar levels and is on a customized home sliding 
scale regimen (pasted below).
Home insulin regimen:

   301-350  17 units  13 units 3 units
   351-400  18 units  14 units 4 units

 # Valvular heart disease:
He has severe functional mitral regurgitation, and severe 
tricuspid regurgitation. These may have been possible 
contributions to heart failure exacerbation, as above.  

 # Peripheral vascular disease: s/p b/l iliac stents and L SFA 
in ___ left internal iliac PTA ___ jailed left internal 
iliac ___, now s/p DES with 0% residual and normal flow to left 
internal iliac artery. Additional occlusions distally filled by 
collaterals ___. Continued on home ASA 81 and atorvastatin 
80.
 
 #Hyperkalemia: Patient with persistent hyperkalemia during 
prior admission. Lisinopril and spironolactone d/c'd, and 
patient was instructed to follow low K diet and f/u with renal. 
Considering possible ___ on CKD vs. RTA Type 4 vs. aldosterone 
resistance ___ use of lisinopril and spironolactone. Cosyntropin 
stim test negative. Potassium remained stable on this admission 
despite diuresis with IV Lasix.

CHRONIC:
 # Chronic kidney disease - b/l Cr 1.5  
 # Hypertension - Continued afterload reduction, as above  
 # Hyperlipidemia - Continued atorvastatin 80mg qhs  
 # Microscopic Colitis: diagnosed on colonoscopy (at outside  
 facility) on ___ - Continued loperamide prn  
 #Hypothyroidism - Continued Levothyroxine Sodium 150 mcg PO

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ because you were gaining 
weight and having shortness of breath. This was most likely from 
your heart failure, which can cause fluid to back up into your 
lungs and legs.

While you were here, we gave you IV Lasix to help remove the 
fluid in your lungs and legs. You also had an upgrade to your 
pacemaker to help your heart chambers pump at the same time.

When you go home, please weigh yourself every morning, and call 
your doctor if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Your medications 
and appointments are below.

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you good 
health.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Cardiology Team

Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of HCV/EtOH 
cirrhosis (decompensated by HE, varices (grade 1 varices x 2 on 
EGD ___, who presents with abdominal pain and CTA abdomen 
showing colitis.  MELD 14, DF 29. 

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Abdominal Pain: Patient presented with right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain.  CTA abdomen did not show any obstruction or 
mesenteric ischemia. Concern for infectious colitis given 
location in R colon, nausea and vomiting however she denied any 
diarrhea. Initially started on ciprofloxacin and flagyl however 
these were discontinued.  Her  abdominal ultrasound does not 
show any ascites, biliary obstruction, or hepatic clots. No 
signs of acute abdomen on physical exam. Alcoholic hepatitis was 
possible given elevated AST>ALT and elevated bilirubin compared 
to prior admission. Her discriminate function 29 as of ___. 
Patient reports drinking recently as of ___. However no 
other signs of alcoholic hepatitis. Steroids were not needed 
given her discriminate function. The patient also has a history 
of marijuana use and cyclical vomiting syndrome was also on the 
differential. No antibiotics were given. The patient started to 
have nausea, vomiting and loose stools during her hospital stay. 
Stool cultures were sent. The patient underwent flex 
sigmoidoscopy   for concern of guaiac positive stool with 
history of hemorrhoids and polyps. However there was no evidence 
of colitis on the sigmoidoscopy. Her pain improved during the 
hospital stay with morphine and nausea controlled with zofran. 
She went a full infectious work up that showed no other cause. 
She started to tolerate PO well. It is likely that she was 
likely suffering from gastroenteritis. 

# Somnolence: Patient was found to be somnolent on admission to 
the floor. This was likely a combination to the IV morphine and 
her acute illness. She was responsive when woken up and did 
answer questions. Her pain medications were held and continued 
on home lactulose and rifaximin. Her mental status improved 
during her hospital stay and was back to baseline on discharge. 

# Sinus tachycardia: Patient was tachycardic into the 100s on 
admission and continued to remain tachycardic during her 
hospital stay. It was likely secondary to dehydration in setting 
of several episodes of vomiting and no oral intake. Patient has 
no other signs of alcohol withdrawal at this point. However she 
was started on a CIWA protocol which she scored for and then 
resolved prior to discharge.  Her pain was well controlled 
throughout the hospital stay. 
 
# History  of alcohol abuse: patient states her last alcoholic 
beverage was on ___. See above for CIWA. She was 
continued on  folate, thiamine, multivitamin and given ativan 
PRN withdrawal symptoms.  

# Alcoholic/HCV cirrhosis: complicated by ascites, 
encephalopathy (multiple admissions this year for confusion), 2 
grade 1 varices on EGD ___ and portal hypertensive 
gastropathy. HCV genotype 1, reports last drink to be ___. MELD 
16 on admission which is stable from prior admission. Last 
colonoscopy ___ with adenomatous polyps on biopsy, no 
stigmata of bleeding, otherwise normal.  However patient had 
guiac positive stool in setting of polyps so she underwent a 
sigmoidoscopy which showed hemorrhoids. She was continued on 
lactulose and rifaxamin. Her spironolactone was held due to 
hypovolemia during hospital stay and restarted prior to 
discharge. 
 
CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Thrombocytopenia: At baseline. Likely related to liver disease 
and alcohol use. No overt signs/symptoms of bleeding at this 
time.  

# Leukopenia: has chronic leukopenia from bone marrow 
suppression from alcohol abuse, WBC on this admission lower than 
previous which may be secondary to infectious process or thought 
to be dilutional .  

# Type 2 diabetes: not on home insulin, started on sliding 
scale, not discharged on insulin. 

# Depression: continued on home medications as per PACT team 
recs

TRANSLATIONAL ISSUES:
- follow up CBC as patient had pancytopenia that was likely 
dilutional

have guiac positive stool on multiple occasions. Hemolysis labs 
were negative and patient had no signs of overt bleeding. GI was 
consulted and patient underwent EGD on ___ with no evidence of 
active bleeding. GI believed the most likely source of bleeding 
was inflammatory colonic polyps given patient's known history of 
bleeding colonic polyps. They recommended OP colonoscopy. His 
hemoglobin remained stable post-EGD. 

# ___ on CKD
# ESRD ___ SLE s/p renal transplant
Patient presented with Cr 3.9 up from baseline of 1.9. Thought 
to be pre-renal in etiology and improved with after IVF. Renal 
U/S did not demonstrate any graft dysfunction, and patient has 
been on stable dose of immunosuppression. Cr down to 1.6 on day 
of discharge. Initially, his MMF dose was decreased in the 
setting of his ___, but his home dose was re-started on ___ 
after resolution of his ___. He continued taking his home 
cyclosporine and prednisone. 

# Persistent A fib (CHADS2-VASc 2)
Patient had episode of RVR, likely due to a combination of 
dehydration and inflammation from his pneumonia. He is normally 
anticoagulated with apixaban, but this was held until ___ in 
the setting of a possible GI bleed (see above). During his 
admission, he was converted to short acting diltiazem and 
metoprolol for rate control while acutely ill. He should resume 
his home long-acting medications on discharge. 

# Metabolic acidosis with AG: 
Patient found to have low bicarbonate that remained stable 
throughout admission. This was likely secondary to his ___ and 
uremia. He was not tachypenic during this admission and lactate 
was within normal limits.

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 60-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for a living unrelated renal transplant. She has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, asthma, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. She was started on immunosuppressive medications, including ATG, methylprednisolone, MMF, and FK, and was also given heparin to bridge her coumadin. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on POD#4 with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain well controlled. Her medications at discharge included sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, nystatin, docusate sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, valganciclovir, tacrolimus, midodrine, fluticasone-salmeterol, pantoprazole, warfarin, and coumadin. The patient was advised to follow up with the Transplant Service and to monitor her blood pressure and blood sugar levels regularly. ||endoftext||"

Urine Legionella Ag (___): Negative
C Diff (___): Negative

REPORTS:
========

EKG (___): Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse low voltage. Wandering 
baseline and baseline artifact. Compared to the previous tracing 
of ___ no apparent diagnostic interim change.

CXR (___): 
1. Worsening rounded opacities in the right lung worrisome for 
multifocal
pneumonia possibly from septic emboli. Wegener's should also be 
considered. 
2. Moderate cardiomegaly and likely a background of mild 
pulmonary edema.

VQ SCAN (___):
This examination is markedly limited due to patient body habitus 
and inability to position.  Several round matched perfusion and 
ventilation defects are present in the right lung and a few 
matched defects are present in the left lung.  These defects 
correspond to areas of opacity seen on the abnormal chest 
radiograph.
 
IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited exam.  Several bilateral matched 
ventilation/perfusion/radiograph abnormalities.  Pulmonary 
embolism cannot be excluded but the shape of the defects is not 
suggestive of pulmonary embolism.

___ DOPPLER STUDY (___):
1.  Severely limited study by body habitus.  No definite 
thrombus is
visualized.  The calf veins cannot be visualized.
2.  Subcutaneous edema in both calves.

PELVIC ULTRASOUND (___):
1. Extremely limited exam due to patient body habitus.  No 
evidence of free fluid.  The adnexa were not visualized on this 
exam.
These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ 
in person at 6 p.m. on the day of the exam, and an MRI was 
recommended for further evaluation.
2. Fibroid uterus.

D+C PATHOLOGY (___):
1. Endometrium, curettage:
- Highly atypical trophoblastic proliferation morphologically 
consistent with choriocarcinoma.
- No chorionic villi or fetal parts identified.

BAL CYTOLOGY (___):
Positive for malignant cells.

LIVER/GALLBLADDER U/S (___):
Sludge filled gallbladder without wall thickening or 
pericholecystic fluid to suggest acute cholecystitis, though it 
can not be completely excluded. No intra or extrahepatic biliary 
duct dilation. 
Mildly echogenic liver is likely from mild fatty deposition, 
however other diffuse liver disease cannot be excluded.. 

REPEAT CXR (___):
Combination of masses and consolidation most severe throughout 
the right lung and in the left lower lung unchanged for several 
days. Heart is enlarged, probably severely, not appreciably 
changed.  Pleural effusions cannot be excluded but are not 
large. No pneumothorax. 

NECK U/S (___):
Limited exam shows no mass anterior to the trachea.

RENAL ___:
1. No evidence of perinephric abscess or hydronephrosis 
involving the right kidney. 
2. The left kidney is not visualized. 

VEIN MAPPING (___):
IMPRESSION: 
Patent bilateral subclavian, cephalic and basilic veins with 
measurements as above. Patent bilateral radial and brachial 
arteries. No evidence of
calcifications. 

TTE ___ IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic 
function. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. No definite valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified.

___ CT HEAD IMPRESSION:  A small enhancing lesion measuring 8 
x 5 mm, in the left cerebellomedullary region -?  Related to 
adjacent left vertebral artery or an enhancing mass lesion. 
Dedicated MRI if not contra-indicated may be considered for 
further characterization. 
Another focus of punctate enhancement best visualized on series 
7, image 54 and series 4, image 26- ?  End-on appearance of 
vessel or a tiny lesion. 

___ CT ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION:  
1. Exam is severely limited by body habitus.  No gross findings 
to suggest distant metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis. 
2. Ill-characterized 5.4 cm hypodense lesion in the left adnexa 
with dense rim.  There is lack of clear fat planes with the 
uterus and this may represent either a primary uterine lesion or 
possibly invasion of an adnexal lesion into the uterus.  No 
prior imaging for comparison and this may represent the primary 
lesion. Consider pelvic ultrasound for further evaluation.  
Though the study will be limited by body habitus, this lesion is 
in location which should 
be amenable to transvaginal visualization. 
3. Rectus diastases with suggestion of a fat containing anterior 
abdominal wall hernia though this is not imaged. 
4. Large fat containing low ventral hernia. 

CT CHEST ___: IMPRESSION: Very limited examination.  Soft 
tissue density pulmonary nodules in all lobes of the lungs, with 
maximum diameters of approximately 16 mm.  No pleural effusions. 
 No airway lesions.  No lymphadenopathy. 

MRI HEAD w contrast ___:
1. Motion limited exam without evidence for intracranial 
metastatic disease.
2. 6 mm fusiform dilatation of the distal left vertebral artery, 
which
corresponds to the abnormality on the preceding head CT.
3. Numerous foci of chronic blood products in bilateral cerebral 
hemispheres
and right cerebellar hemisphere. A lesion in the right temporal 
lobe
demonstrates high signal on T1 weighted images, compatible with 
a cavernous
malformation.  The others are compatible with indeterminate 
chronic micro
hemorrhages, possibly hypertensive, or multiple cavernous 
malformations.
4. Multiple foci of high T2 signal in the supratentorial white 
matter are
nonspecific but compatible with sequela of chronic ischemic 
disease, given the
history of hypertension and renal impairment.
 
___ Trans vaginal ultrasound: 
1.  4.9 x 5.4 x 4.7 cm lesion left of the uterus, also seen on 
the ___ CT, demonstrates ultrasound characteristics most compatible 
with an
exophytic fibroid.  The appearance of bulk fat seen on the CT, 
which is not
appreciated on this examination, can be explained by severe beam 
hardening
artifact, which can substantially distort density measurements.
2.  The ovaries are not visualized

recent hospitalization for LLE cellulitis and pneumonia who 
presented to the ED for increased dyspnea, hemoptysis, abdominal 
pain found to have metastatic choriocarcinoma. She was started 
on EMACO chemotherapy, but her hospital course lasted >6 months 
and was comoplicated by VAP/bacteremia, fungemia, and acute 
renal failure requiring HD. She ultimately recovered and 
completed 8 cycles of EMA/CO (with methotrexate removed because 
of toxicity). Her B-hcg, which was initially >100,000, fell to 
<5. At time of discharge, she has multiple nodules seen on 
imaging, which may or may not represent metastatic foci of 
disease. Some of these nodules were not confirmed on more 
sensitive imaging. Others were not felt to be amenable to biopsy 
given her body habitus. She is being discharged to rehab with 
plans to return for her ninth cycle of E(M)ACO.

 
ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Choriocarcinoma: Patient initially presented with abdominal 
pain, SOB, and intermittent irregular vaginal bleeding during 
the prior 3 weeks, with increasing O2 requirements and 
hemoptysis. In the ED, she was noted to have an hCG > 160,000. 
Due to body habitus, vaginal US was inconclusive and could not 
r/o IUP; her habitus also prevented CT and MRI scanning. Repeat 
CXRs revealed interval growth of nodular masses new in ___, compared to films from ___ of this year. In the setting 
of hemoptysis, vaginal bleeding, and HCG ___, there was 
strong suspicion of choriocarcinoma with lung metastasis. She 
was intubated for operative vaginal US and D+C; pathologic 
specimens from that procedure revealed choriocarcinoma. Oncology 
was consulted, and treatment begun with EMA/CO regimen 
(etoposide, MTX, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
leucovorin calcium). Given ___ as below, MTX was held in initial 
cycle. During hospitalization, patient developed multiple 
different infections including candidemia, vent-associated 
pneumonia, and bacteremia, and chemotherapy was given between 
these different infections, and continued once infections had 
resolved. Her chemotherapy course often had to be interrupted in 
the setting of complications (see below). In early ___ EMACO 
treatment began again.
          Methotrexate given on ___ caused significant 
toxicity causing mucositis and herpetic lesions in gluteal area 
and lower back, leukopenia requiring broad antibiotic coverage. 
New PICC line placed ___. Patient improved and 
antibiotics were slowly peeled off. It was decided no more 
Methotrexate would be given with the EMACO treatment. Her HCG 
levels were trended weekly, and improved from >160,000 to 
undetectable on ___. She then completed two further cycles 
of EMA/CO (with methotrexate removed due to toxicity). Staging 
imaging could not be performed initially due to pt's obesity, 
but she finally had CTs of chest, abd/pelvis, and head in late 
___, showing bilateral pulmonary nodules, two possible 
brain lesions, and an adnexal vs uterine mass. Significance of 
these findings unclear, since it would be unlikley for her to 
have such widely metastatic residual disease with an 
undetectable hCG.  Further evaluation was as follows: The brain 
mass was not confirmed on repeat MRI with contrast. A 
trans-vaginal ultrasound was performed which showed that mass 
seen on CT of the abd/pelvis was arising within the uterus and 
had imaging characteristics consistent with a fibroid. ___ was 
consulted regarding the lung nodules and felt that the 
likelihood of a diagnostic biopsy was low and the risk of 
procedural complications was high. Therefore no biopsy of the 
lung nodules was attempted. She is being discharged to rehab 
with plans to return to the hospital for her ___ cycle of 
E(M)ACO.

#Vaginal Bleeding: The patient was transferred back to the FICU 
on ___ after having profuse vaginal bleeding soaking through 
multiple towels prior to transfer. The patient had recently 
received chemo and it was thought that this bleeding was likely 
___ hemorrhagic conversion of her tumors. ___ was consulted but 
were unable to intervene as they were limited by the patient's 
size. They also would be unable to perform an adequate 
intervention without knowing the precise location of the bleed. 
OB was paged and packed the vagina with gauze after clearing out 
clot from the vagina. The patient transiently was placed on 
pressors for hypotension during this episode. During her stay in 
the FICU, the patient remained HD stable. Radiation oncology was 
consulted but after discussions with their Physics and 
Engineering staff it was not technically or safely possible to 
treat the patient with radiotherapy given her weight. She 
required intermittent RBC transfusions for slowly downtrending 
H/H possibly due to slow vaginal bleeding vs. marrow suppression 
from chemotherapy. She had no further episodes of large vaginal 
bleeding during FICU course, and was transferred back to the 
oncology service. . 
 
# Respiratory Failure: After the D+C, patient was kept intubated 
out of concern for increasing hemoptysis with treatment. She 
self extubated on ___, but became hypoxic and had to be 
re-intubated. She continued on CMV ventilation and was 
eventually weaned to pressure support on ___. However, she was 
very difficult to get off of the ventilator likely due to a 
combination of her obese body habitus and metastatic lung 
disease burden. Given the need for prolonged ventilator support, 
ENT surgery took patient for tracheostomy placement on ___. 
After this time, numerous attempts were made to wean her 
sedation and to wean her ventilatory support requirements, but 
due to her increased agitation as well as her acidemia from 
renal failure, she was difficult to wean from the ventilator. On 
___, she was found to have a ventilator-associated pneumonia 
with fevers, leukocytosis, and positive sputum cultures with 
pseudomonas and two strains of E. coli. She was tx for an 8-day 
course of meropenem. With her renal failure, she was extremely 
volume overloaded from initial aggressive fluid resuscitation so 
was placed on CRRH and eventually HD on ___. When her 
infections were treated, her blood pressures improved, and we 
were able to remove large amounts of fluid with HD. After 
removal of fluid, treatment of VAP, and with continued 
chemotherapy to treat lung mets, the patient was able to be 
weaned off of the ventilator onto trach collar on ___, and her 
respiratory status has been stable. Per ENT, the patient needed 
a long 100-120 mm uncuffed long trach in order to undergo a 
successful capping trial to be considered for decannulation. 
This device was ordered on ___. Since then, the patient has had 
recent episodes of mucous plugging, requiring Mucomyst and 
saline nebs but was satting fine. Eventually patient was 
tolerating breathing through trach on RA, and after successful 
capping trial, had tracheostomy tube removed ___.

# Ventilator-associated pneumonia/Pseudomonal bacteremia: Due to 
continued leukocytosis and fever, cultures were obtained and 
sputum cx from ___ was positive for pseudomonas and two 
strains of E. coli thought to be secondary to a vent-associated 
pneumonia. Pseudomonas had intermediate sensitivity to ___, 
however E. coli sensitive, so treated for an 8-day course or 
meropenem with resolution of fevers for 4 days. On ___, patient 
spiked a low grade temp, and she was recultured. Blood cultures 
grew pseudomonas. Her IJ was removed in the setting of 
bacteremia, and 48-hours after a PICC was placed. Patient was 
initially started on Zosyn, but due to sensitivities, she was 
started on ceftazidime for a 14-day course, dosed with HD, which 
the patient completed on ___. On ___ the patient had an epsiode 
of rigors, tachypnea, and sustained tachycardia in 130s. She was 
never febrile but had just finished HD. A prior sputum culture 
had grown pseudomonas so she was empirically covered with vanc, 
cipro, and tobramycin due to sensitivities. On ___ one bottle of 
blood culture grew Pseudomonas. Patient was treated with a 14 
day course of ciprofloxacin and tobramycin given sensitivities. 
LIJ tunneled HD line from which culture was drawn was removed on 
___, with RIJ triple lumen exchanged for temp HD line with VIP. 
Given concern for infection RIJ removed (___) given no 
need for HD. With new fevers in ___, She was 
broadly covered initially with Vanc / Meropenem / Acyclovir / 
Micafungin, given multiple possible sources: mucositis, Right 
foot base ulcer, bleeding ulcers in back, UTI.

# Acute tubular necrosis: Pt had 700 cc blood loss following D+C 
noted above; she became relatively hypotensive and experienced a 
falling hematocrit. Despite resuscutation with blood and 
crystalloids, her Cr continued to rise and she became massively 
volume overloaded. She was dialysed and eventually placed on 
CRRT. She had persistent issues with the CRRT filters clotting, 
as she was not anticoagulated, and transitioned to HD on ___. 
Her nephrology team anticipated a likely prolonged requirement 
for HD given the lack of response or recovery of her kidney 
function. Given this need, they requested that at tunneled line 
be placed by ___ however, on ___, her blood cultures grew 
___ (see below for more details), so the tunneled line was 
deferred. Following a 14-week course of fluconazole for 
fungemia, ___ successfully placed a permanent tunneled left IJ on 
___. Eventually the HD line clotted off, so on ___, ___ 
changed the line with an over-the-wire placement. The patient 
was evaluate by transplant surgery on ___ given difficulty with 
the tunneled line on ___. The patient received vein mapping on 
___ to evaluate for placement of Herograft for permanent 
dialysis access but subsequently successfully received dialysis 
on ___, so the need for permanent access was deferred. She 
continued on HD on a ___ schedule. Patient however began to 
produce urine, with creatinine downtrending, and HD was held 
(after consulting with renal) as of ___. For rest of hospital 
course patient did not require hemodialysis. Her new baseline Cr 
after this was approximately 1.4-1.6.

# Candidemia: Culture taken on ___ from her R PICC grew 
___. Culture taken on ___ from her L HD line eventually 
grew ___ as well. She was started on micafungin on ___. ID 
was consulted and recommended removing R PICC and culturing tip, 
removing L IJ HD line, ophtho exam, TEE, and ultrasound to 
evaluate for fungal peritonitis. The ultrasound showed no 
obvious ascites. Beta-d-glucan was negative. Ophtho evaluation 
showed no fungal endophthalmitis or papilledema but did show 
peripapillary hemorrhages, nonspecific finding. TEE showed no 
vegetations and normal cardiac function. Cultures speciated 
___ albicans, so her micafungin was switched to fluconazole 
per ID recommendations to complete a 14-day course. Micafungin 
was again started in ___ due to concern for infection though 
no source was found. This was subsequently discontinued.

# Hypercalcemia: Noted to have increasing calcium, trending up 
since ___, with normal albumin, and elevated PTH to 244. Thought 
to be secondary to tertiary hyperparathyroidism from ESRD and 
prolonged immobility. It was difficult to give IVF given HD 
dependence, and concern for fluid overload, so she was evaluated 
by Renal and started on sevalamer. She also was dialyzed with 
low calcium bath with HD, with improvement in hypercalcemia. Per 
renal, cinacalcet initiated ___. She was planned for U/S to 
evaluate for parathyroid adenoma ___ but per radiology, a 
Sestamibi scan would be a superior study. However due to body 
habitus, this would be difficult to coordinate. The decision was 
to keep the patient on sevalamer and cincalcet for the time 
being, which has been appropriately controlling Ca levels. 
Eventually given patient's well controlled calcium levels 
cinalcet was discontinued. 

# Sepsis ___ ESBL E Coli UTI: Patient developed low grade fevers 
on morning of ___ and became tachycardic and hypotensive, 
requiring initiation of norepinephrine for blood pressure 
support. She was pan-cultured with CXR and started on empiric IV 
vancomycin and meropenem for neutropenic coverage. Her urine 
cultures grew ESBL, and no growth in blood cultures, so was 
treated with a 7 day course of meropenem and vancomycin. While 
on the OMED service, hospital course was complicated by fevers 
as above (#Respiratory failure) and patient was treated with 
Vanc/Meropenem/Micafungin/Acyclovir given multiple sources of 
infection in ___ through ___. No source was found.

#Anemia: Patient required numerous blood transfusion during her 
hospital stay to maintain her Hb>7. Transfusion requirement was 
thought to be ___ marrow toxicity from her EMACO chemotherapy.

#Nutrition: She had some issues tolerating her tube feeds, and 
on ___ was started on methylnaloxone and reglan, with good 
response in terms of bowel movements. She was continued on a prn 
bowel regimen to ensure appropriate bowel movement frequency in 
an effort to avoid GI backup and tube feed residuals. On ___ 
she had evaluation by speech & swallow, and cleared for pureed 
liquids only. On the floor, had several episodes of a displaced 
NGT, which was not replaced on ___. In the FICU, she passed 
speech and swallow eval and her diet was advanced. On the 
oncology service, patient intially had a low potassium, low 
phosphate diet per ATN (see above). She had trouble with PO 
intake after mucositis due to methotrexate on ___. But as 
she recovered she was able to tolerate POs and a completely 
normal diet by the time of discharge.
    Her weight fluctuated massively while in the hospital. She 
reached as high as 681 lbs while fluid overloaded and was 
discharged at a weight of around 500 lbs. Her albumin was 3.4 at 
time of discharge.

# Elevated LFTs: On ___, started to have increasing LFTs which 
stabilized with AST 150s, ALT 200s, and AP 100s. No elevation of 
Tbili to suggest obstruction. Unclear if due to medication side 
effect (quetiapine, Zyprexa, ceftaz, chemo) or other cause, 
however with no abdominal pain on exam, her LFTs were trended 
throughout stay. RUQ ultrasound from ___ with sludge, but no 
evidence of cholelithiasis. The patient's LFTs continued to 
downtrend. She again experienced mild transaminitis peaking at 
100s in ___ in the setting of fluconazole use. Her med list 
was pared down and her transaminitis cleared.

# HTN: During her prolonged hospital stay, home 
antihypertensives were periodically held in the setting of 
sepsis. While on OMED service, Labetalol was increased to 200mg 
TID given elevated pressures and this regimen worked well for 
patient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# Microcytic anemia: Patient has a history of microcytic anemia 
at baseline, usually in the low ___. On iron supplementation, 
but this was held in the setting of abdominal pain. Patient 
received a number of transfusions during her hospitalization. 
She seemed to be transfusion dependent and received a unit of 
blood almost every day or other day.

# Hyperactive bladder: Oxybutinin was held as foley remained in 
place while patient was intubated and sedated. The patient 
continued to have a foley in place throughout her FICU stay and 
the start of her OMEd stay. Foley was changed a number of times 
throughout her hospital stay.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
-return ___ from cycle 9 EACO
-Hb check twice weekly at rehab, txfuse 1 u pRBC for Hb<7.
-her home antihypertensive regimen (previously on lasix, lower 
dose labetolol, and lisinopril) was pared down at time of 
discharge with ___ improved blood pressure control. Now only on 
labetalol 200 mg TID.
-She has a cracked crown in one of her R molars. Once stabilized 
from her choriocancer, she will need a dental and/or OMFS 
evaluation.
-needs BiPAP at night

Brief Hospital Course:
On evening of admission, prior fem-fem cutdown site was probed 
by Fellow, who was easily able to palpate the graft. The 
following day, a wound vac was placed on this site. Pt's ray 
incision was packed with iodoform. A LLE ultrasound was obtained 
to evaluate pt's asymmetrical edema and was negative for DVT.   
Pt was seen by her outpt Cardiologist, who recommended a family 
meeting and palliative care consult should pt require a major 
operation. 
On HD 4, a CTA was obtained and demonstrated decreased fluid 
around the graft and an open bypass graft with flow to the foot. 
That night, she tripped on her vac and began to complain of L 
leg pain. 
The following day, pt continued to complain of L leg pain as 
well as SOB. She spiked another fever. Bcx was again sent and a 
CXR demonstrated diffuse interstital edema and small pleural 
effusions. The next day, pt's SOB resolved but her L leg pain 
persisted. Another LLE US found no DVT and a knee x-ray did not 
demonstrate any acute findings. During a vac change, fluid was 
sent and grew E.coli. 
The next day, HD 7, pt's leg pain persisted. Pain meds were 
increased. X-rays from the pelvis down were obtained; they 
showed osteopenia but no fractures or dislocations. A blister 
was noted of the dorsum of her left foot and her antibiotics 
were changed to vancomycin and zosyn (from vanc/cipro/flagyl) to 
better cover streptococcus. The following day the pt's leg pain 
was somewhat improved but the blister on her foot had enlarged. 
A CT scan was obtained and showed edema but no air or abscesses. 

On HD 9, pt's LUE AV graft was unable to be accessed at HD. The 
following day, Interventional Radiology performed a successful 
thrombectomy and venoplasty. On HD 10, a foot XRay was taken, 
which demonstrate a non-displaced ___ metatarsal fracture. 
Podiatry was consulted and recommended no intervention and 
heel-touch only weight bearing status in the left side. The do 
not believe the left foot blister and residual wound is related. 
On HD ___, antibiotic coverage was adjusted to allow for dosing 
only with dialysis, for ease of administration outside the 
hospital. On HD ___ arrangements were made for the patient to be 
discharged to rehab. At the time of discharge, her pain was 
controlled, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding and 
moving her bowels spontaneously. She was sitting up in a chair 
for the large part of the day, but was not yet moving around on 
her own. She should continue physical therapy in rehab to work 
on regaining her mobility.

RADIOLOGY
=========
___ 10:12 AM ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)   
FINDINGS:  
Multiple air-fluid levels are seen the right upper and left 
upper quadrant with gaseous distended small and large bowel.  
There may be sigmoid colonic gas.  Pneumobilia is again noted.  
Gastrostomy tube and surgical clips noted in the mid abdomen.  
Densities overlying the lower lumbar vertebral bodies are likely 
from prior vertebroplasties. 
IMPRESSION:  
Bowel gas pattern could represent obstruction or ileus.  
Additional evaluation with CT scan can be considered. 

___ 12:___BD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST   
FINDINGS:  
LOWER CHEST: Bibasilar atelectasis is mild. There is no evidence 
of pleural or pericardial effusion. 
ABDOMEN: 
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions.  Pneumobilia 
is slightly decreased from prior.  Mild intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation is again seen.  The CBD measures up to 1.2 cm (02:18) 
without evidence of choledocholithiasis.  There is air in the 
gall bladder lumen, without stones or gallbladder wall 
thickening. 
PANCREAS: Fatty infiltration of the pancreas seen.  There is no 
evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  
There is no peripancreatic stranding. 
SPLEEN: Splenomegaly is unchanged.  The spleen shows normal 
attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. 
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape. 
URINARY: 1.1 cm right upper pole cortical hypodensity (02:27) is 
unchanged. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of stones or 
hydronephrosis. There are no urothelial lesions in the kidneys 
or ureters. There is no perinephric abnormality. 
GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a small hiatal hernia.  Gastrostomy 
tube tip is in the jejunum.  The patient is status post 
ileocecectomy.  Lack of wall to wall filling of the distal small 
bowel and subsequent apparent wall thickening is likely due to 
mixing artifact. Distal small bowel loops are somewhat dilated, 
up to 3.2 cm, however contrast material is seen in the ascending 
colon and there is air and stool in the colon more distally. 
Colon and rectum are within normal limits.  Prominent mesenteric 
lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT size threshold for 
lymphadenopathy. 
RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy. 
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is 
moderate calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great 
abdominal arteries.  There is a replaced right hepatic artery. 
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. 
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Penile calcifications are again seen.   
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: 
There is no evidence of suspicious lesions.  Osteopenia is 
noted. Multilevel vertebroplasty and right femoral hardware are 
unchanged.  Old gastrostomy tube tract is seen. Right inguinal 
hernia containing fat is again seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Distal small bowel loops are mildly dilated, but enteric 
contrast is seen in the ascending colon and there is air and 
stool in the colon more distally, more suggestive of mild ileus 
rather than bowel obstruction. 
2. Lack of wall to wall filling with oral contrast of the distal 
small bowel and resultant apparent wall thickening is likely due 
to mixing artifact. 
3. The common bile duct measures up to 1.2 cm without evidence 
of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.  Pneumobilia and mild 
intrahepatic biliary dilation are again seen, consistent with 
prior sphincterotomy. 
4. Splenomegaly is unchanged. 
5. 1.1 cm right renal hypodensity is unchanged.  Continued 
attention is recommended on future exams. 

___ 2:46 ___ ESOPHAGUS
FINDINGS:  
Esophagus was not dilated and no extrinsic mass was identified.  
The esophageal mucosa appears normal. 
The primary peristaltic wave was broken in the mid esophagus 
with many tertiary contractions.  An 13 mm barium tablet was 
administered with a few seconds of hold up in the lower 
esophagus, reproducing the patient's symptomatology.  The pill 
passed into the stomach uneventfully with termination of the 
patient's symptoms. 
Limited visualization of the stomach is unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Esophageal dysmotility with prominent tertiary waves, 
consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm.
2.  The patient's symptomatology was reproduced momentarily 
while the barium tablet passed through the gastroesophageal 
junction. 

___ 10:41 AM CHEST (PA & LAT)   
FINDINGS:  
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is a right-sided 
PICC line with tip in the distal SVC.  There is volume loss/ 
infiltrate in the left lower lobe that is new compared to prior 
again seen and more conspicuous than on the prior study are 
multiple mildly dilated loops of bowel.  The patient had a 
contrast-enhanced CT 1 day ago and therefore there is contrast 
outlining many of these loops of bowel.  However with unusual is 
that in many areas it appears that both the inside and outside 
of the bowel wall is visualized.  There is no other evidence of 
free air and therefore this is likely an artifact of the manner 
in which the contrast has been distributed   
IMPRESSION:  
Volume loss/ infiltrate in the left lower lobe mildly dilated 
loops of small bowel with unusual appearance to the bowel wall.  
A followup upright film to exclude free air would be helpful 

___ 1:03 ___ ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)   
FINDINGS:  
Again seen is contrast outlining bowel loops.  At this point in 
time most of contrast is in the colon.  There are multiple 
air-fluid levels in the small bowel which is nondilated.  A 
gastric tube is visualized pneumobilia is present no free air is 
identified   
IMPRESSION:  
Ileus versus partial SBO 

___ 3:44 ___ UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT   
FINDINGS:  
There is normal flow with respiratory variation in the bilateral 
subclavian veins. 
The right internal jugular and axillary veins are patent and 
compressible with transducer pressure. 
The right brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins are patent, 
compressible with transducer pressure and show normal color flow 
and augmentation.  A PICC is seen in a right brachial vein.   
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper 
extremity. 

PATHOLOGY
=========
___ GASTROINTESTINAL MUCOSAL BIOPSY
1.Terminal ileum, biopsy:
- Chronic mildly active ileitis.
2.Colon, ulcer, biopsy:
- Colonic mucosa with ischemic-type injury and fibrinopurulent 
exudate consistent with ulceration; see note.
3.Colon, random, biopsy:
- Colonic mucosa within normal limits.
Note: The differential diagnosis includes local effect of the 
anastomotic site, certain infections (C. difficile, 
enterohemorrhagic E. coli), primary vascular, or drug induced 
etiologies (e.g. NSAID's). No granulomata or dysplasia 
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of diabetes 
type 2 uncontrolled complicated by neuropathy, Crohn's disease 
s/p ileocecectomy and multiple laparotomies for SBO, chronic 
diarrhea and recurrent pseudo-obstructions prompting venting 
G-Jtube, admitted ___ w diarrhea and abdominal distention 
thought to represent partial small bowel obstruction, with long 
hospital course course notable for intermittent intolerance of 
tube feeds, subsequently requiring initiation of TPN after long 
discussions with patient and GI service, now tolerating well, 
having regular bowel movements without signs of obstruction or 
diarrhea, discharged home with TPN; 

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Intermittent Small Bowel Obstructions / Diarrhea / Abdominal 
pain / Crohn's Disease / Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth - 
On presentation, the patient had acutely worsened diffuse 
chronic abdominal pain on presentation. Subsequent workup 
supported multifactorial causes including likely intermittent 
partial small bowel obstructions, osmotic diarrhea from dietary 
indiscretions (eating lots of starburst candies) and Crohn's 
disease.  Initial concern was for SBO. He had a CT with PO and 
IV contrast that showed mild ileus. However, there was some 
thickening of the bowel wall that initially raised concern for 
Crohn's flare (on subsequent revised read, the thickening was 
deemed artifact). Subsequently, he had a colonoscopy that showed 
ulceration at his colonic-colonic anastomosis with biopsies 
showing terminal ileum inflammation. Given that the results were 
suggestive of Crohn's, the patient was started on budesonide 9mg 
PO daily. Furthermore, in working up his diarrhea, which 
improved with no oral intake, he was found to have a stool Osm 
gap of 357-2*(70+24.3) = 168, which suggested an osmotic 
diarrhea. When tube feed was initiated (see below), his diarrhea 
worsened to over 10 times overnight. Eventually, given that he 
had a borderline SIBO breath test in the past, he was started on 
rifaximin empirically for SIBO treatment. When he started TPN 
(see below), his diarrhea improved to 4 BMs per day.

# Acute Protein Calorie Malnutrition - Patient with > 20lb weigh 
loss over last 6 months.  He had intermittent symptoms as above, 
but failed trials of starting on tube feed on 4 separate 
attempts due to abdominal pain, distension and diarrhea.  He was 
tried on several formulations without improvement. Patient 
educated on risks/benefits of TPN.  Ultimately, he was started 
on TPN via R PICC access. He will eventually need consideration 
for a Port-A-Cath if he is to continue TPN long term--given the 
uncertainty about how long he would require TPN, port not placed 
this admission.  He tolerated TPN well with no electrolyte 
abnormalities and signs of refeeding syndrome. He was giving 
thiamine intermittently throughout his hospitalization with 
tubefeed and TPN. 

# Dysphagia | Esophageal Spasm - The patient reported 
significant swallowing issues during his stay and refused to 
take in POs, including pills. He had a barium swallow study that 
showed findings consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm. GI 
consult team wanted to follow up with manometry testing as 
outpatient before starting therapy. Fortunately, his symptoms 
improved during the course of his stay, and he requested 
trialing PO food and was able to tolerate small amount of POs on 
discharge.

# Chronic Back Pain | Chronic Abdominal Pain - Due to NPO 
status, he was given IV hydromorphone in place of his PO regimen 
at home for the most part of his stay. The patient requested on 
multiple occasions to speak with the Pain specialists here. The 
Pain Consult team saw the patient and recommended uptitration of 
gabapentin to 900mg TID for chronic pain and maintaining his 
home narcotics regimen. The team discussed with the patient that 
his abdominal pain can possibly be attributed to his high 
narcotics requirement leading to narcotics bowel syndrome. The 
patient was very reluctant to the idea of decreasing his pain 
medications, stating that without them, he cannot have a normal 
life and wants to have a life. He was discharged on his home 
regimen, but with the understanding that if abdominal symptoms 
should recur or persist, he may need to consider downtitration 
of opiates. He reported needing more hydromorphone despite 
having filled a recent prescription for a 1 month supply only 2 
weeks prior to admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension: The patient's BPs had been well controlled 
throughout his admission up until the last part of his stay, 
when he had elevated BPs to 180s at times. His home labetalol 
regimen was uptitrated to 400mg TID from 300mg TID. It's 
possible this is due to switching from IV hydromorphone to PO.

# COPD: No symptoms while hospitalized. He continued home 
inhaler regimen. 

# Diabetes Mellitus: Complicated by neuropathy. Patient endorsed 
neuropathic pain in his feet. He continue home Gabapentin liquid 
as tolerated.

# Coronary Artery Disease: He had no symptoms. He continued ASA 
and labetalol. Lisinopril was DC'ed as outpatient due to labile 
blood pressures.
  
# Anxiety/Depression: The patient's overall mood was stable but 
he became tearful at times when discussing his chronic illness. 
He continue home lorazepam, buproprion, and buspirone.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- TPN: Will need ongoing evaluation of his nutritional 
requirement.
- Access: Patient currently has a PICC for TPN administration. 
If he will be on TPN for a long time, please consider placing a 
Port for longer term access.
- Antibiotics: Will need to continue taking rafaximin 550mg PO 
TID for 7 days, until ___.
- Pain: Patient has been having ongoing issues with abdominal 
pain. His gabapentin was uptitrated to 900mg TID per the 
recommendations of Pain consult team.
- Hypertension: Patient's BP was low earlier during stay but 
became elevated towards the end (160s), likely due to no longer 
receiving IV pain medication. His labetalol was uptitrated to 
400mg TID. Please consider another antihypertensive agent since 
his heart rate is only ___ at discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after having increasing difficulty 
with maintaining nutrition at home and increasing abdominal 
pain. We performed a CT scan that ruled out a small bowel 
obstruction. We performed a colonoscopy that showed inflammation 
at your anastamosis site, for which we are treating you with 
budesonide, an oral steroid. Furthermore, for your difficulty 
swallowing, we found some signs of esophageal dysmotility on a 
barium study. Fortunately, your symptoms improved without any 
intervention.

Despite our best attempts to start nutrition with tube feed, we 
were unsuccessful. Therefore, we eventually decided to start 
total parenteral nutrition, which you will need to continue on 
until you are able to better tolerate eating by mouth. Last, we 
tried to optimize your diarrhea by trialing you on an 
antibiotics to treat bacteria overgrowth in the small bowel.

Your blood pressure was elevated towards the end of your 
hospitalization. We increased your home dose of labetalol, and 
you will need to follow up with Dr. ___ further 
titration.

Please check your finger sticks at home so that we can monitor 
your glucose level and determine whether you need insulin in 
your TPN.

It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the best!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team

ACUTE ISSUES
============

# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation: At the OSH, the 
patient was found to have pulmonary edema and pleural effusions 
on admission CXR with labs significant for WBC 10.5,Cr 1.74, BNP 
2732 (893 on ___, and cardiac enzymes negative x3. She was 
diuresed with 40mg IV lasix BID for a CHF exacerbation. O2 sats 
improved to 94% on 2L, and the patient symptomatically improved 
over the course of 24 hours. After discussion with her 
outpatient cardiologist, the patient was transferred to ___ 
for cardiac catheterization. Cath at ___ on ___ showed 
slight progression of left stenosis (40->50%) and elevated 
filling pressures. She will likely need a repeat PCI in 6 
months. TTE was deferred as she had a recent TTE in ___. For 
her ___, diuresis was initially held. However, her Cr was only 
mildly increased (1.8 from 1.5) and was stable. Therefore, to 
improve symptoms, diuresis was resumed with the patient's home 
medications. She diuresed well and achieved baseline respiratory 
status on furosemide 40mg daily (a slight increase from her 30g 
daily) and spironolactone 25mg daily. She should have repeat 
electrolytes on ___ (script written). She achieved her dry 
weight of 91.1kg. She was scheduled follow-up with her PCP and 
cardiologist.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============

# CAD s/p PCI: Cath on ___ showed left main with 40-50% 
distal restenosis, LAD and Diag stents patent with mild diffuse 
disease, LCX with mild disease, and RCA with 50% unchanged 
distal stenosis. The patient did not endorse chest pain, and no 
intervention was performed. She will need to have a repeat cath 
in ___ months.

# COPD: At the OSH, she was given duonebs and steroids for 
potential COPD component to her dyspnea. After transfer, her 
presentation was considered more c/w an exacerbation of heart 
failure, and steroids were discontinued. She was restarted on 
her home COPD inhalers in-house and at discharge.

# Type II Diabetes: The patient has had poor control of her 
blood sugar. She was recently switched from lantus to 70/30 by 
outpatient endocrinology. She was continued on 70/30 and humalog 
ISS in-house and her victoza was held. For her diabetic 
gastroparesis, she was continued on a reduced dose of 5mg 
metoclopramide (rather than 10mg) due to slightly worsened Cr. 
At the time of discharge, her blood sugars were under better 
control and she was restarted on her victoza. She was continued 
on the reduced dose of metoclopramide due to a stable Cr of 1.8.

# Hypertension: She was continued on her home amlodipine and 
losartan in-house and at discharge.

# Chronic kidney disease: The patient has CKD Stage III with 
baseline Cr 1.4-2. On presentation, her Cr was 1.8 and diuresis 
was initially held. However, her Cr was only mildly increased 
(1.8 from her recent Cr of 1.5) and was stable with 
re-initiation of diuresis. She should have repeat electrolytes 
on ___ to monitor for improvement in her Cr.

# Restless leg syndrome: She was continued on her home 
ropinerole in-house and at discharge.

# Depression: The patient continued her home duloxetine in-house 
and at discharge.

# Insomnia: She was continued on her home trazodone in-house and 
at discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was pleasure caring for your during your stay at ___. You 
were recently admitted for worsening heart failure. You were 
treated with diuretics, which helped to remove much of the 
excess fluid. You were also treated for a COPD exacerbation at 
the outside hospital. You were transferred to ___ for 
catheterization, and this showed slightly more narrowing of one 
of the blood vessels supplying the heart. However, the narrowing 
was not significant enough for intervention. We increased your 
home diuretic of furosemide from 30mg daily to 40mg daily. You 
were also continued on your spironolactone 25mg daily. Your 
shortness of breath improved as well as your leg swelling. Your 
discharge weight is 200lbs. You were discharged with follow-up 
in cardiology, as you will likely need a repeat cardiac 
catheterization in 6 months. Please take all medications as 
directed and please attend all follow-up appointments.

We wish you all the best!

Your ___ care team

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

Chief Complaint:
Right renal mass
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Robotic right partial nephrectomy

 
History of Present Illness:
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Ms. ___
here at ___ today at the request of my
colleague in urology, Dr. ___ in consultation
regarding her small right renal mass.  As you know, Ms. ___ 
is
a ___ woman who is an active smoker, who had a renal 
mass
that was discovered in ___, at which time it showed a 1.1 x 1.2
x 1 cm lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney that was
endophytic in nature.

A followup MRI in ___ showed that the lesion was 1.3 
cm
in size and had low-grade enhancement and it was consistent with
papillary renal cell carcinoma with a possibility of lipid poor
angiomyolipoma and oncocytoma as well.

Followup renal ultrasound showed that the nodule in the upper
pole seems a little bit larger, so followup MRI was performed 
and
this was done on ___, which showed growth of this
lesion, currently measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.4 cm.  Differential
diagnosis was a papillary renal cell carcinoma, once again, with
lipid-poor AML and oncocytic neoplasms also on the differential
diagnosis.  Also noted was an accessory right renal artery.  She
is asymptomatic.  12-point ROS was completely negative.  

She presents for further discussions regarding this mass that
appears to be growing.  I explained that there is probably a
70-80% chance that this mass is malignant.  However, renal 
masses
that are less than 3 cm are very unlikely to metastasize and
research has shown that it is safe to follow up on using active
surveillance.  However, a few cavities in her case make active
surveillance a little bit less ideal.  First, she is young and
given the gross weight of this mass, I have no doubts that over
the period of her lifetime, it will grow to the size where we
will need to remove it or treat it.  Second, it is completely
endophytic and therefore, further growth may make it more
difficult to treat in the future.  I, therefore, recommended 
that
she consider treatment of the right renal mass.

We discussed options for treatment, first being a right partial
nephrectomy, which has the highest chance of success, more than
98%.  The other options include cryoablation of the mass, which
would be less invasive, but has a lower success rate in the
80-90% range, as well as CyberKnife radiotherapy, which has been
new and promising treatment for these renal masses, but has a
shorter track record, as it is newer.  There appears to be quite
promising and I did offer that option as well.

I explained that the risks of partial nephrectomy were infection
and bleeding as well as possible need for an open procedure
(10%), as well as the possible need for radical nephrectomy
(___).  This should be done through a minimally invasive
robotic technique, which will hopefully minimize her scars, as
well as abdominal pain.  I would expect that she will still need
to take at least three to four weeks off work, however, as our
studies have shown that more than half of patients takes greater
than 30 days off work after this procedure.

She would like to think further about her options and is
definitely considering a more minimally invasive approach to 
this
tumor, even though she understands that the success rate may be
slightly lower.  She will speak to her husband, and I have
encouraged her to also speak to Dr. ___.  If she is
to undergo surgery, she would like to undergo this in ___,
when her work is less busy.  I think this is completely
reasonable and I would like to obtain repeat imaging before that
so that we have more recent imaging and there were no surprises
in the operating room.  She will be in contact with us and/or 
Dr.
___ her decisions going forward, and I am happy to
provide assistance in any way possible.

Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care,
please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns 
you
may have.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
right partial
nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events occurred; 
please see dictated operative note for details. The patient 
received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient was 
transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable condition. On 
POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated for urine output 
>30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and incentive 
spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient ambulated, 
restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel and 
complete blood count were checked, pain control was transitioned 
from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a clears/toast 
and crackers diet. On POD2, foley catheter was removed and 
subsequently JP was removed after the output remained low. Diet 
was advanced as tolerated. The remainder of the hospital course 
was relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged on POD3 
in stable condition, eating well, ambulating independently, 
voiding without difficulty, and with pain control on oral 
analgesics. On exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with 
no evidence of hematoma collection or infection. The patient was 
given explicit instructions to follow-up in clinic in 
approximately four weeks time.

IMAGING & STUDIES
==================
___ ABD & PELVIS W/O CON
IMPRESSION: 
1. There is a large amount of free intraperitoneal air.  This 
may be due to
recent procedures although bowel perforation cannot be excluded 
especially as
there is more air than what is expected.
2. Evaluation the abdomen is limited for intra-abdominal 
collection and for
bowel ischemia due to lack of IV contrast however there is no 
gross organized
collection.  There are inflammatory changes and bowel wall 
thickening near the
hepatic flexure of the colon as well as a mild-to-moderate 
amount of fluid in
this area.  This may be due liver disease however an infectious 
or
inflammatory process should also be considered.
3. There are bilateral moderate to large pleural effusions with 
associated
atelectasis as well as patchy opacities at the right lung base 
concerning for
developing pneumonia
4. Liver is shrunken and nodular concerning for cirrhosis

___ ABD & PELVIS W/O CON
IMPRESSION: 
1. Moderate volume ascites, with a large amount of 
intraperitoneal free air,
loculated in pockets throughout the ascitic fluid.  While 
ascitic fluid
measures low density, loculated air suggests increased 
viscosity, compatible
with recent paracentesis.  Persistent free air may be related to 
recent
laparotomy, however remains concerning for viscous perforation.
2. Unchanged stigmata of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions.

___ (PA & LAT)
IMPRESSION: 
1. New bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with 
adjacent
atelectasis.
2. Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels 
are concerning
for small bowel obstruction.  This is better evaluated on the 
abdominal
radiograph from ___ at 11:55.

ECG ___
Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Compared to the previous 
tracing
of ___ early precordial R wave transition is again recorded. 
There is
variation in precordial lead placement as is the likely reason 
for change in
leads V1-V2. The QTc interval is prolonged. Otherwise, no 
diagnostic interim
change.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with NASH cirrhosis complicated by ascites and hepatic 
encephalopathy, HF (EF 50%), IDDM c/b Charcot foot s/p R BKA, 
transferred from ___, found to have 
secondary bacterial peritonitis likely from perforation and 
severe ___ concerning for HRS. His hospitalization was 
complicated by respiratory distress w/ pleural effusions, 
requiring MICU transfer for drainage of ascites and pleural 
fluid. In the MICU,  after 2L pleural fluid drainage, the 
hospitalization was further complicated by shock ___ volume 
shifts, briefly on pressors. The patient's prognosis was 
explained to him and he was made CMO, transferred back to the 
floor ___. He expired ___.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=================
# Secondary Bacterial & Candidal Peritonitis:
# Contained Perforation:
OSH ascites cultures were positive for Klebsiella, Enteroccocus 
and ___. Patient was treated at OSH for SBP but inflammatory 
cell counts on repeat paracenteses did not improve, concerning 
for secondary peritonitis. Abdominal imaging showed a large 
amount of free air consistent with a contained perforation 
(possibly from paracentesis or colonoscopy). ID was consulted 
and patient was started on IV ampicillin/sulbactam and 
fluconazole. Patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy but 
the procedure had to be terminated early due to bleeding 
abdominal wall varices (EBL 500cc) and a drain was placed. 
Patient was transferred back to the medical hepatology floor 
with transplant surgery on consult for ongoing management. He 
continued antibiotics, but ascitic fluid and blood cultures grew 
candidal and enterococcal spp, respectively. Once made CMO, the 
antibiotics were discontinued.

# ___ on CKD: 
Cr was 4 on admission at OSH, previously 1.7 in ___. Mixed 
picture of likely ATN with HRS. Had diarrhea and large volume 
paracenteses at OSH in setting of active infection with reported 
episodes of hypotension and likely under-resuscitation post 
procedurally. Patient was treated with albumin, midodrine, and 
octreotide as well as bicarb and sevelamer. Cr never recovered.

# ___ Cirrhosis: 
Patient of Dr. ___ not on transplant list. MELD 
39. 
- Ascites: held home diuretics given hepatorenal syndrome as 
above
- Infection: management as above
- Hepatic encephalopathy: continued home rifaximin, lactulose 
prn
- Varices: No varices on recent EGD ___, however, had 
abdominal wall varices identified on ex lap.

# Anemia: 
Hgb nadir was 6.6 at OSH and patient was transfused 1 unit pRBC. 
Patient without history of varices on last EGD. Patient had 
significant bleeding intraoperatively due to abdominal wall 
varices (EBL 500cc) but did not require any further transfusions 
post-op. Home pantoprazole was continued.

# HFpEF (EF 50%):
Patient had significant ascites and pleural effusions which were 
attributed primarily to his cirrhosis and renal failure. 
History, trop/MB and ECG were negative for ischemia. Telemetry 
showed good rate control on home metoprolol. Home diuretics and 
___ were held in the setting of severe ___. Home metoprolol was 
fractionated.

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation:  Apixaban was previously 
discontinued due to high risk for bleeding. Initially, home 
metoprolol was fractionated and HR remained well controlled. In 
the setting of being CMO, the beta-blocker was also stopped.

CHRONIC ISSUES

Chief Complaint:
Slurred speech, headache, tingling and loss of sensation in

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture ___

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a PMH significant for 
polycystic kidney disease who presents with slurred speech, 
headache, and tingling and loss of sensation in his right leg. 
The following history is obtained from the patient, his 
girlfriend, and younger brother.

Mr. ___ was in his normal state of health until about 4 weeks 
ago when he developed a mild headache and intermittent joint 
pains in his ankles and wrist, worse on the right side. He 
presented to his PCP who prescribed ___ and Naproxen for 
sinusitis/inflammation appreciated on ear exam. He reports 
persistent HA over the subsequent 2 weeks. 

On ___, per reports of his girlfriend, who witnessed the 
event, he was driving and speaking on the phone, when all of a 
sudden he hung up the phone and began ""seizing"". He was observed 
to be foaming at the mouth and his extremities were at first 
very stiff and completely extended, such that his feet were 
pressed down very hard on the gas pedals, and then he began 
flailing with both his arms and legs. His eyes were rolled back 
into his head and he turned his head to the right, and he was 
not responding to any verbal stimuli. The entire event lasted 
for about 20 minutes. After the seizure ended, he regained 
consciousness and was crying in pain because of trauma to his 
shoulder during the incident. He was somnolent, confused, and 
very lethargic following the seizure. He was unable to express 
clear thoughts and his speech was very slurred and unclear. He 
was taken to ___, where a non-contrast head CT reportedly showed 
nothing significant. He was discharged with outpatient 
follow-up. 

Today, the patient presented to his PCP because of ___ 
leg weakness, headache, slurred speech and had been acutely more 
confused the previous evening. Since his seizure, he endorses 
feeling generally more fatigued and experiencing a persistent, 
stable headache in the same bilateral distribution. His family 
members who accompanied him to the appointment report that he 
was behaving strangely and was overly happy and friendly. He was 
reportedly approaching people in the waiting room insisting that 
he knew them and had gone to school with them, when they were in 
fact strangers. He reportedly did this multiple times and was 
very insistent. When he was walking in to the hospital he 
reported that he had no ""feeling in his right leg"" and required 
assitence with walking. Although his speech was improved today, 
family reports that he was slurring his speech last night. He 
continues to report a frontal bilateral headache, ___ pain, 
that has been stable for the past several days. He denies 
phonophobia, photophobia, or changes in vision. Brother reports 
recorded temperature as high as 99.0 while at home.

On neuro ROS, the pt loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, 
dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or 
hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties comprehending speech.  
Denies focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or

IMAGING:
Scrotal Ultrasound (___): Normal scrotal sonogram

NEUROPHYSIOLOGY:
EEG (___): This is an abnormal continuous EEG study due to 
mildly slow background activity with superimposed brief and 
prolonged runs of generalized intermittent rhythmic delta 
activity, at times with frontal predominance suggestive of mild 
to moderate encephalopathy. There are also frequent runs of high 
amplitude sharply contoured generalized rhythmic delta activity 
with embedded blunted sharp waves that often start on the right 
fronto-temporal region and seems to evolve in amplitude and 
distribution with no stereotypical clincal correlate which are 
concerning for electrographic seizures. 

EEG (___): This is an abnormal continuous EEG study due to 
slowed background activity with both brief bursts and runs of 
frontally predominant generalized intermittent rhythmic delta 
activity suggestive of mild to moderate encephalopathy. There is 
also generalized rhythmic delta activity with embedded blunted 
frontal sharp waves that do not clearly evolve into 
electrographic seizures and are without clinical correlate. In 
addition, there are also independent bursts of right frontal 
temporal slowing as well. At times, these are more broadly based 
over right hemispheres and evolve to become briefly more 
generalized. There is, at times, evolution in amplitude and 
embedded sharp waves making these more concerning for brief 
electrographic seizures. There is no clinical correlate seen 
with these on video. 
   
MRI Head with and without contrast (___): 
1. Significantly motion-limited head MRI, without evidence of a 
seizure 
source. 
2. Significantly motion-limited head MRA, with poor assessment 
for small 
intracranial aneurysms.  No large aneurysm identified. 
3. No evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. 

HEAD MRI (___):  The study is limited by motion.  There is 
no evidence of intracranial enhancing lesions.  There is no 
evidence of edema, mass effect, abnormal diffusion, or blood 
products in the brain parenchyma.  Ventricles and sulci are 
normal in size. There is polypoid mucosal thickening in the 
superior aspects of bilateral sphenoid sinuses. 

HEAD MRA: (___) This study is significantly limited by 
motion artifacts, which particularly limits evaluation for small 
aneurysms.  The intracranial internal carotid and vertebral 
arteries, and their major branches, appear patent without 
evidence of high-grade stenoses.  The posterior inferior 
cerebellar and anterior inferior cerebellar arteries are not 
clearly visualized, likely due to the motion artifacts. 

Head MRV: (___) HEAD MRV:  Flow is visualized in the 
superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus, bilateral transverse 
sinuses, and bilateral sigmoid sinuses, without evidence of 
thrombosis. 

Chest X-ray (___): Possible trace right effusion.  Otherwise 
no acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT Head without contrast (___): No evidence of acute 
intracranial process.  If there is high clinical concern, MRI is 
more sensitive for the detection of acute stroke if not 
contraindicated. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ ___ man with PKD, who 
presents with slow speech, confusion, bizarre behavior, reported 
___ weakness, and persistent headache in the setting of 
a recent, first-time seizure two weeks ago. 

# NEURO: patient was admitted to neurology service and work up 
was started for encephalopathy with amnesia, personality 
changes/agitation and seizures. Infectious work up was done and 
CSF was sent for HSV, VZV and enterovirus which were all 
negative. He was treated with acyclovir x7 days while HSV/VZV 
panel were pending, and acyclovir was discontinued when these 
results returned negative. 

MRI of brain showed some changes in his basal ganglia and 
thalamus and possible subtle changes in his L temporal lobe. As 
autoimmune encephalitis was high on the differential diagnosis 
given his presentation, various antibodies including LGI-1, 
VGKC, ___, Anti-Ma/Ta, ___ paraneoplastic panel and 
Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were sent and all returned 
negative. As the results of these studies were pending for 
couple of weeks, patient was empirically treated with 5 day 
course of high dose steroids and IVIg. 

He was loaded with levetiracetam given history of seizures and 
episodes concerning for complex partial seizures including 
olfactory hallucinations prior to admission. He also had EEG 
done while in house which showed bifrontal delta seizures, so 
phenytoin was added to levetiracetam with improvement in EEG. 
Given the episodes of agitation, he was started on valproate 
instead and levetiracetam was weaned off. He did have some 
perioral twitching, so EEG was replaced to look for more 
seizures but did not show it. His perioral twitching improved 
with therapeutic levels of phenytoin and valproate.

Clinically, patient continued to have encephalopathy with 
amnesia, paranoia and intermittent agitation requiring chemical 
and physical restraints. Psychiatry was consulted for better 
management of his antipsychotics given his paranoia. 
Rheumatology was also consulted for possibility of CNS 
vasculitis. He was found to have elevated ESR/CRP, but negative 
___ anticoagulant antibody, SS-A was 
mildly positive but SS-B was negative.

3. Agitation: multiple purple codes, has received combination of 
haloperidol/lorazepam/benztropine, and leather restraints  
- appreciate psych recs, to balance episodes of intermittent 
severe agitation & aggression against oversedation, further 
decreasing morning doses of risperidone. Continue 1 mg qAM, 1.5 
mg qPM and 1 mg qHS.  
- Psych recommending decreased dose of haloperidol 2.5 mg prn 
for agitation requiring medication. Discussed with parents at 
the family meeting today that we would try to minimize extra 
medications for sedation but it may be required at times for the 
patient and staff's safety.  
- clonidine patch to decrease sympathetic output  
4. Perioral & left hand twitching movements: intermittently 
present, possibly perioral asterixis. Urine/serum copper and 
ceruloplasmin wnl, so ___ less likely.  

# OPHTHO: Patient developed right eye conjunctival 
injection/edema, likely conjuctivitis, ophthamology consulted 
but could only do limited examination due to patient's 
agitation. He was empirically started on ciprofloxacin eye drops 
and erythromycin eye ointment with improvement. 

# ID: 
Given concern for immunocompromise and ?atypical/opportunistic 
infection, HIV antibody and HIV viral load were sent and were 
negative. He also had T-cell subset sent given question of 
isolated T-cell deficiency but that was also wnl. 

He was tested for cryptococcal antigen in serum/CSF which were 
both negative. CSF bacterial/viral cultures were negative from 
the initial CSF, and fungal culture was negative.
Patient had intermittent leukocytosis, then developed fevers 
around ___ and rash. 

# HEME: reported history of sickle cell trait. He had decreasing 
hemoblogin count few days after his IVIg and his labs were 
positive for hemolysis with elevated LDH and decreased 
haptoglobin. His direct coombs test was positive as well, and 
this was thought to be due to side effects from 
IVIg.Hematology/oncology was consulted and recommended daily CBC 
to monitor Hgb level and also recommended 7 days of folic acid 
for supplementation. His HB and HCT remained stable since then

# DERM: trucal/arm rashes with erythematous small papular 
rashes, . DRESS syndrome due to phenytoin:
The patient was seen by dermatology service, started on IV 
solumedrol and topical steroid, then changed to PO prednisone 
equivalant dose.He was improving with decrease in rash and liver 
enzymes.
He was discharged home on 80 mg of prednisone, will be taperred 
in his neuro follow up visit 

# RENAL: history of polycystic kidney disease, urine out put and 
cr level remained stable in this hospitalization  
# FEN: He was on regular diet, replete lytes prn

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to take care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted due to headaches, confusion 
and difficulty with your right leg. You had a lumbar puncture 
done and your cerebrospinal fluid showed evidence of 
inflammation but no bacteria. You had an MRI of your head done 
which showed subtle evidence of inflammation.

You were treated with antibiotics and antiviral medications 
while in the hospital for possible bacterial or viral 
meningitis/encephalitis (inflammation of brain or tissue 
covering the brain). Causes of brain inflammation/infection were 
investigated through lumbar punctures which demonstrated no 
Herpes Simplex, Enterovirus, Lyme, HHV6, or other viral disease, 
nor were any bacterial or fungal infections noted.  The 
Para-neoplastic panel was also found to be negative for any 
cause of inflammation.  Based on these findings, we were able to 
stop all of the anti-viral and anti-biotic therapies. We 
continued your steroid management for 

You were also treated for seizures given your episode 2 weeks 
ago and also for possible partial complex seizures (confusion, 
olfactory hallucinations).  You will stay on anti-epileptics 
after your discharge. You should not drive till your next visit 
after  being evaluated.
You developed reaction to dilantin and started on prednisone and 
your symptoms were improved.
Brain inflammation and steroid both can cause behavioral 
changes, to control these symptoms you were started on 
risperidone and need to continue this medication.
You were evaluated by our physical therapist and they recommend 
to have 24 hours supervision for now till you are evaluated in 
your follow up visit.
As you developed seizure, although you are on medication, it is 
possible that you experience another one, please avoid swimming, 
driving and lying in bathtub for now.
It was our pleasure to take care of you.
You should take these medication per instruction:
1. Risperidone 0.5 mg in the morning, 1 mg at 4pm, 1mg at 8pm.
2. Prednisone 80mg daily for now.
3. Divalprox 500 mg in the morning and 750 mg at noon and 750 mg 
at night.
4. Lacosamide 200mg twice a day.
5.please take ranitidine for your stomach protection
-please take calcium and vitamin D for your bone protection 
while you are taking steroid.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F with EtOH cirrhosis s/p liver txp in ___, 
and a recent admission for abdominal and hip pain, presenting 
with R hip pain. The pain was evaluated by orthopedic surgery 
with a joint aspiration, and septic arthritis was ruled out 
based on fluid analysis. A CT scan and x-ray of the hip was 
negative for fracture, hematoma, or hardware misalignment. She 
was seen by rheumatology, who had low suspicion for inflammatory 
etiology of hip pain. Pain management recommended starting 
low-dose gabapentin for a potential neuropathic element to the 
pain, and she was seen in house by physical therapy. An L-spine 
MRI was also done showing degenerative changes, but no acute 
reason for her pain. 

Though there was initial concern for a UTI, based on the initial 
UA and the patient's history of a MDR UTI during a previous 
admission. However, clean catch urine culture was negative for 
growth, so antibiotics were stopped, and the patient remained 
afebrile throughout admission.

INR on admission was initially supratherapeutic at 3.1-3.5. 
Warfarin was held for one day and then restarted. After warfarin 
was held, INR fell to 1.6 (subtherapeutic). The patient will be 
discharged on the same dose of warfarin (5 mg PO daily).

Transitional Issues
- Please draw CBC and INR on ___ at Orthopedic appointment. 
- For anticoagulation, patient was discharged on Lovenox as 
bridge to Coumadin 
- F/u with transplant hepatology on ___. 
- Will need outpatient titration of warfarin and discontinuation 

of lovenox once INR is therapeutic. 
- ___ to check INR every 3 days weekly and fax to Liver 
Transplant 
Center at ___
- ___ potentially benefit from urologic evaluation for recurrent 
UTIs
- Consider further uptitration of gabapentin if tolerated (at 
200 mg TID at discharge)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure treating you at ___! You were admitted here 
for pain in your right hip. Though there was originally concern 
that there was an infection in your hip joint, when the joint 
fluid was taken out with a needle, there was no infection in the 
fluid. You received an x-ray and a CT scan of the hip, both of 
which showed that the bones were not damaged. You also had an 
MRI of your back which did not show that any bulged discs were 
causing your symptoms.  You were seen by pain management who 
recommended starting a low dose of gabapentin.  When you were 
discharged, your hip had improved so that you were able to bear 
weight and walk around.  We adjusted your pain medications while 
you were here, and it is important that you stop taking the 
medication and talk to a doctor if you feel the pain medication 
is making you confused. It is also important to continue 
physical therapy as you were before you came in.

While you were here, we were worried at first that you might 
have a urinary tract infection similar to one you had when you 
were here at ___ before. However, your urine did not grow any 
bacteria, and so you will not need antibiotics at home.

Your INR, which measures how well the Coumadin was working, was 
too low while you were admitted. We started another 
anti-clotting medication called Lovenox, which you will take in 
addition to Coumadin until the INR is between ___. 

We wish you the best,

Your ___ care providers
 
___:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted with right hip pain. She has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, liver transplant, and osteoporosis. She has also had previous surgeries, including a right partial hip replacement and a left hip intertrochanteric hip fracture. The patient's symptoms improved during her previous hospitalization, but worsened again while she was an outpatient. She reports pain in her right hip and leg, which radiates into her right groin and down the back of her leg. She also reports intermittent burning with urination and 4 days of brown/green stool per day.

The patient's physical examination revealed limited range of motion in her right leg due to pain, and tenderness along the lateral hip to palpation. Her laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and liver enzymes. A joint aspiration was performed, and septic arthritis was ruled out based on fluid analysis. A CT scan and x-ray of the hip were negative for fracture, hematoma, or hardware misalignment.

The patient was diagnosed with right hip pain, and her pain management plan included starting low-dose gabapentin for a potential neuropathic element to the pain. She was also seen by physical therapy and had an L-spine MRI, which showed degenerative changes but no acute reason for her pain. The patient's warfarin was held for one day and then restarted due to an initial supratherapeutic INR. She was discharged with a plan for follow-up with her primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon. ||endoftext||"

___ after her procedure on ___ (see below). She will remain on 
BID dosing through ___ then switch to 20 mg daily on ___. 
Patient should complete at least 6 months of anticoagulation - 
extension of this course should be discussed with patient's PCP 
given prior episodes of DVT. 

#Retained food in esophagus
#Esophagitis
#Aspiration event: patient with witnessed aspiration event at 
rehab while eating chicken. Prior to this patient denies 
coughing after meals. CT scan demonstrated extensive 
consolidation in lower lungs concerning for aspiration and 
retained food in
esophagus which could contribute to aspiration events.  Patient 
was evaluated by Speech and underwent video swallow study. 
Transient penetration of thin liquids visualized but no 
aspiration therefore patient cleared for regular diet with thin 
liquids. Retained food in esophagus also noted on video swallow 
study as well. GI was consulted and patient underwent EGD on 
___. Noted to have esophagitis and started on BID PPI. She will 
require repeat EGD in ___ weeks.

T2DM complicated by retinopathy, CKD on dialysis ___, and 
PVD s/p LLE ___ angioplasty on ___ and L Hallux amputation 
___ who presented with chest pressure. 

Given onset at rest, non-radiation, lack of diapheresis, and 
improvement without NG, chest pain is atypical. Trops mildly 
elevated x3 (0.29, 0.31, 0.33) in the setting of ESRD. CK-MB 
normal (4). ECG with only non-specific T wave flattening in 
lateral leads. CXR ___ showed pulmonary edema with effusions 
but no acute cardiopulmonary disease. TTE ___ showed EF 50% 
and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
suggested with basal to mid inferior hypokinesis. PMIBI ___ 
showed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and 
depressed ejection fraction (45%) without focal reversible 
perfusion defect, compatible with cardiomyopathy. Pt's chest 
pressure most likely does not represent ACS, but PMIBI and TTE 
demonstrate that patient has CAD and systolic CHF. We discharged 
the patient on SLNG PRN, ASA 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75mg 
daily, and metoprolol 12.5mg daily. Per PCP, pt was on 
atorvastatin from ___, which was stopped due to needing 
prior authorization at that time. Since he does not have any 
medical contraindications and atorvastatin is now generic, 
replace pravastatin with atorvastatin 40mg daily for better 
lipid control and secondary prevention. No left heart 
catheterization at this time. Patient is medically optimized 
with a statin, dual antiplatelet therapy, and BB. No ___ 
due to ESRD.

Patient had epigastric TTP on exam and history of GERD and ASA 
use. We continued home pantoprazole and gave a GI cocktail PRN. 
Discharged on home pantoprazole. 
 
For the patient's diabetes, home glargine and sliding scale were 
continued. For ESRD, patient received his scheduled dialysis 
___ and sevelamer, calcitriol, calcium acetate, and 
nephrocaps were continued.
 
We continued abacavir, lopinavir-ritonavir, and raltegravir for 
HIV.

For HTN, home amlodipine was continued and metoprolol XL was 
added.

For the patient's L Hallux amputation, we continued daily 
dressing changes and acetaminophen and oxycodone PRN for pain. 
The patient was transferred to vascular surgery service and was 
taken to the operating room on ___ for a partial ___ ray 
amputation performed by podiatry for osteomyelitis and ischemia. 
 There were no intraop complications.  His cultures grew Staph 
and Pseudomonas.  He was started on a 14-day course of Cipro and 
Clinda.  He underwent HD on per his routine HD schedule. He was 
discharged on ___.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ man with a history of asthma, 
obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, prediabetes, and 
hyperlipidemia who is presenting to the ED from his PCP's office 
with one month of worsening dyspnea on exertion.  
.  
He reports for the past 2 weeks, increasing dyspnea on exertion. 
He typically could run a mile and now can barely walk 15 steps, 
most notable as he cares for his grandchildren. He reports 
associated mild lower extremity edema that has been present for 
at least 3 months. He had a mild asthma attack 2 weeks ago in 
the setting of his daughter smoking in his presence. He 
otherwise denies chest pain, tightness or pressure in the recent 
past. Denies recent illness. He does have a persistent mildly 
productive cough of white sputum that is chronic for him. These 
symptoms are similar to his recent admission for pneumonia in 
the past. Otherwise further denies, diaphoresis, nausea, emesis, 
left arm or jaw pain. No known anginal equivalent.  
.  
After speaking frankly with his health care proxy at the 
patient's request, the HCP reports several episodes of bloody 
emesis after bouts of drinking in the recent past but not just 
prior to admission. The patient denies this reporting rather 
vomiting up bloody nasal congestion after sleeping in the dry 
heat. He drinks only on the weekend, mostly beer, with 
occasional liquor. Denies withdrawal symptoms, daily drinking or 
prior drinking history.  
.  
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to ___ with similar 
symptoms 4 months ago. The etiology of his dyspnea at that time 
was felt to be secondary to an asthma exacerbation and 
pneumonia. He was treated with prednisone burst and antibiotics 
and nebulyzer therapy. Cardiac cause was ruled out with normal 
unchanged ECG from baseline, a normal TTE and stable cardiac 
enzymes (0.08) that were cycled. He was then treated over the 
phone w/ doxycycline in early ___ for a pneumonia although CXR 
demonstrated no acute findings.  
.  
In the ED, initial vital signs 100.2 84 125/76 20 94% 3L. Labs 
demonstrated a troponin of 0.22, CK-MB 20, CPK 400 and a d-dimer 
of 1164. Chem 7 and CBC were otherwise normal. A chest xray 
showed. An EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and non-specific 
ST changes - no STEMI. Given elevated d-dimer and pleuritic 
chest pain a CTA was obtained which demonstrated no main or 
segmental pulmonary embolism. There was no evidence of aortic 
dissection. Of note extensive bilateral centrilobar and 
paraseptal emphysema. He was started on a heparin gtt and 
aspirin 325. Given productive cough he was given Azithromycin 
500mg, prednisone 60mg and albuterol and ipratropium nebulyzer 
therapy. Vitals on tranfer were: 98.7 °F (37.1 °C), Pulse: 85, 
RR: 23, BP: 112/64, O2Sat: 99, O2Flow: Neb, Pain: 0. The patient 
denied chest pain throughout his ED course and was chest pain 
free on transfer to the floor.

On arrival to the floor, 98.8 143/68 91 18 92% RA. He is chest 
pain free, and comfortable in bed.

COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
demonstrated non-obstructive coronary artery disease.  The LMCA 
was free 
of any angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The 
LAD and 
LCx had minimal lumen irregularities.  The RCA had a 50% 
proximal lesion 
with no other significant disease. 
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided 
filling 
pressures with mean RA 10mmHg, and normal left-sided filling 
pressures 
with a PCWP of 11 mmHg.  There was moderate-to-severe pulmonary 
arterial 
hypertension with PA pressures of 65/25, mean 38 mmHg.  The 
systemic 
arterial pressures were normal with a central aortic pressure of 
109/58, 
mean 71 mmHg.  The cardiac output was preserved with a cardiac 
index of 
4.2 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption). 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Non-obstructive coronary artery disease. 
2. Mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures, and normal 
left-sided 
filling pressures. 
3. Moderately severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
4. Systemic arterial normotension. 
5. Preserved cardiac output. 
  
___ Echo: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is 
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right 
ventricular pressure overload. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Severe pulmonary hypertension. Dilated right 
ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction and evidence of 
pressure overload. Mild symmetric LVH with normal global and 
regional systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
pulmonary pressures may be higher, although the tricuspid 
regurgitation jet quality on the *prior* study precluded 
accurate a truly accurate estimation of the PASP. 
___ Barium swallow: 1. Moderate esophageal dysmotility and 
delayed emptying from the esophagus into the stomach. 
2. No achalasia, obstructing mass or stricture. 
3. Small traction diverticulum at the mid esophagus at the level 
of the 
carina. 

___ KUB: Three supine and frontal views of the abdomen 
demonstrate retained barium throughout the non-dilated small 
bowel and right colon to the level of the hepatic flexure from 
recent esophagram performed earlier the same day.  There are a 
couple nonspecific loops of small bowel in the left abdomen 
which appear functionally dilated due to peristalsis. Barium is 
also seen retained in the fundus of the stomach. IMPRESSION: No 
evidence of bowel obstruction. 

___ EGD: Small hiatal hernia, Erythema in the antrum 
compatible with mild gastritis
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep 
apnea, obesity, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted for 
worsening SOB and fatigue, with no significant CAD noted on 
catheterization but severe pulmonary hypertension noted on 
echo/cath, as well as intermittent emesis, with only mild 
erythema of gastric mucosa on EGD.  
.  
# SHORTNESS OF BREATH/SEVERE PULMONARY HYPERTENSION: Patient was 
admitted with progressive shortness of breath with associated 
elevation in cardiac enzymes was initially concerning for 
NSTEMI. EKG was non-specific but showed some mild changes in 
anterolateral leads compared to baseline. CE: trops 0.22->0.11, 
CKMB 18. Patient was started on aspirin 81mg. Cath on ___ 
showed no significant CAD or cardiac cause of symptoms. Patient 
remained hypoxic (91% on 3L NC) without evidence of infection 
(normal WBC and differential), or pulmonary edema 
(catheterization showed no increase in wedge pressure, 11). CXR 
showed likely mild degree of pulmonary edema superimposed on 
chronic interstitial lung disease and CT scan showed no evidence 
of central or segmental pulmonary embolism, however subsegmental 
arteries were not well assessed (Ddimer 1145), pulmonary 
hypertension and significant emphysema, as well as a dilated 
esophagus with food contents within it. Patient had been taking 
inhalers (albuterol and Advair) regularly without any noticable 
increase in asthma symptoms, no WBC concerning for acute 
infection (normal differential). Pulmonary was consulted. Echo 
this admission showed severe pulmonary hypertension, thought to 
be due to his OSA and COPD. He is also at risk for obesity 
hypoventilation which could also lead to pulmonary hypertension 
in the setting of chronic hypoxemia. A VBG showed an HCO3 of 36. 
Spiriva was started and Advair and albuterol were continued. 
Patient was managed with CPAP at night and set up with home 
oxygen given his oxygen requirement, and chronic decompensation. 
He was set up with an outpatient sleep study to further evaluate 
for obesity hypoventilation and was requested to additonally 
follow up with his outpatient pulmonologist, Dr. ___ 
medical management of his pulmonary hypertension. Also, given 
his recurrent emesis, there was concern for aspiration, 
especially given CPAP use, however upper GI series did not show 
any evidence of aspiration of barium.
.
# Recurrent Emesis/GI issues: Patient noted intermittent emesis 
of food without significant associated nasuea in the weeks prior 
to admission (daughter confirms emesis for months) and continued 
to have recurrent emesis which was occasionally heme positive, 
thought to be due to superficial mucosal tears. Hematocrit 
remained stable during admission. CT scan this admission noted a 
dilated esophagus with a collection of food within it, which was 
likely causing his recurrent vomiting of food. This was 
additionally supported by the fact that the patient's emesis 
ceased when he was made NPO. Given the finding of the dialated 
esophagus, GI consulted. An upper GI series/barium swallow 
showed moderate esophageal dysmotility and delayed emptying from 
the esophagus into the stomach, no achalasia/obstructing 
mass/stricture, and a small traction diverticulum at the mid 
esophagus at the level of the carina. EGD showed mild gastritis 
and a small hiatal hernia. Patient was started on omeprazole 
20mg daily. Patient mentioned he's had bloody bowel movements in 
the past, in addition to intermittent fevers, night sweats, and 
weight loss. Patient reports last colonoscopy was ___ years ago 
and showed polyps. Inhouse prep was unsuccessfully administered 
for colonoscopy. As a result, patient was set up with outpatient 
GI appointment for further outpatient management of recurrent 
emesis as well as plan for outpatient colonoscopy. H/ pylori 
serology was defered to outpatient management.
.
# Acute Kidney Injury: On admission patient's creatinine was 
1.0, and increased briefly to 1.4 in the context of intermittent 
emesis and decreased PO intake.  Patient responded to 1 liter of 
IVFs and Cr returned to 1.0. Enalapril and HCTZ were 
intermittently held.
.
# HYPERTENSION: Blood pressure was well controlled during the 
admission, with the addition of metoprolol tartrate 25mg TID to 
his home regimen of enalapril 10mg and hydrachlorothiazide 25mg 
daily. He was discharged on metoprolol succinate 100mg daily, in 
addition to ACEI and HCTZ.
.  
# History of PRE-DIABETES: Last hemoglobin A1c was 5.6% on 
___. Patient was given a diabetic diet, blood glucose was 
within normal limits without medical management.
.  
# BACK PAIN: Continued home percocet for symptomatic relief.
.
# CONTACT: HCP ___ ___, Daughter ___ 
___ ___ 
.
Transitional Issues:
- GI follow up for esophageal dismotility/delayed esophageal 
emptying, noted on barium swallow, with persistent episodes of 
emesis with occasional minimal blood tinge. Given weight loss, 
intermittent low grade fevers and night sweats, patient should 
additionally be scheduled for colonoscopy. This was attempted 
inhouse, however the patient could not tolerate the prep (he 
drank 4L of golytely in 2 hours without a bowel movement and 
subsequently vomited up nearly this amount of fluid 5 hours 
after finishing the golytely). He will likely need significant 
prep prior to his scheduled colonoscopy.
- Pulmonary follow up for severe pulmonary hypertension and 
sleep evaluation for obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patient 
will likely need to be started on medical treatment for 
pulmonary hypertension, after work up is complete. He has follow 
up with Dr. ___ pulmonologist) and Dr. ___ 
the sleep study.
- ___ set up for home oxygen given hypoxia at rest
- patient requires an H. pylori serology study as an outpatient, 
given his mild gastritis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for new shortness of breath. A 
cardiac catheterization was performed and showed no coronary 
artery disease (the blood vessels to your heart did not have any 
significant blockages in them). An echo was performed and showed 
severe pulmonary hypertension, indicating that your symptoms are 
due to your progressive lung disease caused by your emphysema 
and obstructive sleep apnea. You should have an outpatient sleep 
evaluation to determine if your CPAP settings should be changed. 
You also have been scheduled for follow up with Dr. ___ to 
start treatment for your pulmonary hypertension.

For your persistent vomiting, you had an upper endoscopy which 
did not show any significant abnormalities. You have some 
inflammation of your stomach lining, so we started you on an 
acid suppresant called omeprazole. You have been scheduled to 
see gastroenterology (the stomach doctors) to have this problem 
further evaluated in the outpatient setting. You should also be 
scheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy during this appointment 
as well.

Please continue your home medications as prescribed.
The following changes have been made:
START Spiriva 1 cap inhaled daily
START Aspirin 81mg daily
START Simvastatin 20mg daily
START Metoprolol XL 100mg daily
START Omeprazole 20mg daily
TAKE Zofran ___ tablets every 8 hours as needed for nausea and 
vomiting. Do not take more than 6 tablets in a day.

You are being discharged with home oxygen, which you should wear 
at rest and with exertion. Your oxygen saturation should be 
above 92% with the oxygen supplementation.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo female with a past medical history metastatic 
RCC, diagnosed ___ years ago, with brain and lung mets s/p 
nephrectomy and chemo, most recently on experimental protocol, 
s/p bronchial stenting on ___, now with respiratory 
decompensation, hemoptysis, found to have occlusion of right 
side of stent by tumor growth, brought to ___ today for bronchial 
artery embolization.  
.  
Prior to this admission, the patient presented with LUE weakness 
after a visit to her chiropractor, s/p nephrectomy and 
chemotherapy, and was found to have a pathologic fracture of C7. 
She was brought for embolization of tumor and C7 corpectomy 
(received solumedrol for cord compression), however, after this 
procedure, her course was c/b post-op inability to move any 
extremities. MRI showed no compression but edema of C2-T1. On 
___, she was intubated for respiratory distress with SBP ___, HR 
130s, and she was started on Diltiazem gtt with Neo for SVT with 
hypotension. She also underwent a right sided thoracentesis on 
___ with 700cc removed, and broad spectrum antibiotics were 
started for fevers and empiric tx for VAP. She was extubated on 
___, but then had a witnessed localized motor seizure and was 
started on dilantin which was transitioned to keppra. Over the 
next several days, her respiratory status appeared worse, and 
underwent another bronchoscopy on ___ secondary to right lung 
collapse. At this time, the patient was considering transition 
to hospice, but then her respiratory status began to improve, 
and she regained some mobility in her arms and legs and decided 
she preferred to proceed to rehab instead.  
.  
She was to be discharged on ___, when she suddenly began to 
have increasing respiratory distress. She was taken by IP for 
flexible bronch for therepeutic aspiration of secretions and 
visualization of Y stent, where it was discovered that, after 
therapeutic aspiration was performed, the left limb of the 
Y-stent was patent without endobronchial lesions or active 
bleeding, however, on the right side, there was a tumor ingrowth 
to the distal end of the stent which was approximately 90% 
occlusive. This area was extremely friable and was the source of 
bleeding. She was then taken by ___ for ___ out of concern for 
continued bleeding.  
.  
She was then transferred to the MICU from ___ for monitoring s/p 
___. At night has anxiety induced dyspnea where she is placed on 
NRB and given ativan. On ___ a CXR showed complete 
opacification of right hemithorax, likely a combination of 
atelectasis and fluid due to lack of signicicant midline shift 
(overall slight leftward shift) concerning for blood as patient 
is status-post embolization. IP then spirated long obstructing 
blood clot from R main stem beginning at level of tumor. She was 
then stable in the ICU and transferred to ___ for further 
observation.

Radiology Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study 
Date of ___ 9:06 ___ Final Report 
EXAM: CT of the chest, ___. 
INDICATION: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, with increasing 
hypoxia and 
hypotension. ? PE. 
COMPARISON: Multiple priors, most recently torso CT from 
___. 
CTA CHEST: There is no pulmonary embolism. Thoracic aorta is 
normal in 
caliber and contour throughout. There is no dissection. 
Right pleural effusion has increased in size, now moderate. 
Small left 
pleural effusion is new. Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy 
is not significantly changed. Large conglomerate nodal mass in 
the right upper paratracheal area is grossly unchanged, now 
measuring 6.2 x 4.8 cm (previously 6.2 x 5.1 cm). Large 
subcarinal and bulky right hilar lymphadenopathy is not 
significantly changed. AP window lymph node is stable in size. 
Partial occlusion/invasion of the superior vena cava is 
unchanged. A tracheal Y-stent has been placed since previous CT, 
which is patent. There is apparent slight narrowing of the right 
upper lobe bronchus (3, 44) which appears increased since 
previous exam.  Right main pulmonary artery passes directly 
through the conglomerate lymphadenopathy, but is not attenuated. 
Small pericardial effusion is unchanged. 
Multiple parenchymal nodules and pleural-based nodules are not 
significantly changed. Moderate right basilar atelectasis is 
new. Scattered small centrilobular ground-glass and semi-solid 
nodules in the left lower lobe, and in portions of the anterior 
right upper lobe, and superior segment of the right lower lobe 
may represent small foci of infection or aspiration. This study 
is not specifically tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.  
Limited views of the upper abdomen show multiple foci of early 
arterial hyperenhancement in the liver parenchyma which have not 
been visualized on previous imaging (though there is no prior 
imaging) which includes an early arterial phase for direct 
comparison. Partially imaged hardware is seen at the site of 
recent C7 corpectomy, bone graft, and plating, at the location 
of known pathologic fracture, which is better evaluated on 
recently performed MRI of the cervical spine. There is no other 
definite osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy. IMPRESSION: 
1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. Increased pleural effusions, right 
greater than left. 3. No significant change in widespread 
pulmonary/pleural, and mediastinal metastases. 4. Unchanged 
thrombus/partial occlusion of the superior vena cava. 5. 
Multiple small foci of early arterial hyperenhancement in the 
liver.  Given absence of prior arterial phase imaging for 
comparison, it is unclear if 
this is a new finding. Most likely, these represent hemangiomas, 
but if there are liver function abnormalities, or clinical 
concern for liver metastases, abdominal ultrasound could be 
performed for correlation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to neurosurgery service after complaints of ___ 
weeks of progressive weakness in the left hand.  After 
hospitalization it was revealed that the pt had an outpt 
bronchoscopy that left her with some upper extremity weakness x 
1 week.  She then sought chiropractic care for neck pain that 
left her with some LUE weakness.  Imaging of the cervical spine 
revealed C7 pathological fracture ___ renal cell mets.  

After she was admitted she was placed in a hard collar.  She was 
readied for the OR and on ___ went to neuro interventional 
radiology for pre-op embolization prior to OR.  After the 
embolization she remained intubated but appeared to have left 
leg weakness.  Her sedation was lightened on the way to the OR 
and she was unable to move all 4 extremities.  She was then 
placed in traction in OR and underwent C7 corpectomy.  She was 
also started on solumedrol protocol for spine injury. 

She tolerated the procedure and was kept intubated and 
transferred to PACU where she remained overnight for close 
monitoring.  She also underwent MRI of brain which demontrated 
the following: metastasis in the left frontal lobe and left 
occipital lobe. Tiny areas of acute infarct in the cerebellum 
seen as restricted diffusion. Normal MRA of the head. She also 
underwent MRI c-spine which showed increased signal within the 
spinal cord from C2-T1 level could be due to ischemia or cord 
edema. Status post corpectomy of C7 with normal alignment of the 
vertebral bodies. Decrease in size of the left paraspinal mass 
related to surgery and embolization. 

On the first post-op morning her motor exam improved slightly 
and she was moving her right arm with slight movement left 
hand/wrist.  Dressing was clean and dry.
On ___ pt. was extubated and then re-intubated secondary to 
failure to clear secretions. Two days later she was started on 
broad spectrum antibiotics for fevers and empiric coverage of 
VAP. Family meeting held to decide on another trial of 
extubation and then trach if needed. No further oncological 
treatment offered. Pt aware and agrees with this plan. 

The patient was successfully extubated a few days later and is 
tolerating a face tent for oxygenation.  On ___ the patient was 
observed to have some focal motor seizures characterized by arm 
tremmors.  She required frequent bolus' of dilantin and was 
transition to Keppra for sz control. 

She was seen by speech therapy and was ultimately cleared for a 
diet after extubation and when she was able to tolerate it 
safely.  In the meantime she was fed via NGT.

Her respiratory status was fluctuating and there was some 
discussion as to if the pt should be electively trached if she 
required reintubation.  Ultimately she did not require 
reintubation so this became a mute point.   She did express that 
she did not want hospice and that she would like to pursue 
agressive therapy and be transferred to rehab.  She was bronch'd 
on the ___ for increasing RLL infiltrates and right 
lung collapse.

Neurologically she improved in her upper extremity exam with 
more stength proximally than distally.  Her lower extremity exam 
has remained poor.  Ultimately her respiratory status improved 
so that she could tolerate a video swallow eval.  Her NGT was 
removed and she was placed on thin liquids and moist ground 
solids.  Nutrition consult was obtained to assess caloric 
intake.

She was re-seen by Interventional Pulmonary to assist in 
clearing of her secretions on ___.  During their procedure 
they noted that the right mainstem bronchus was 50% occluded 
around the ___ and now is 60-80% occluded with blood clots 
overlying the protruding mass.  No intervention was performed 
during the procedure.  

The IP attending discussed course of action with pt, husband and 
children.  They would like to move forward with treatment of 
bronchial obtruction.  Her lovenox was discontinued in prep for 
intervention.  ___ consult for embolization was called as well as 
RT consult for RT to mass.  This was discussed with family and 
performed ___.  Pt and family also decided upon DNR/DNI after 
long discusssion. Pt was transferred to MICU after the 
procedure. After much thought, the family reconsidered code 
status and made the patient full code. She then had a bronchial 
artery embolization and was then transferred to the MICU from ___ 
for monitoring. At night has anxiety induced dyspnea where she 
is placed on NRB and given ativan. On ___ a CXR showed complete 
opacification of right hemithorax, likely a combination of 
atelectasis and fluid due to lack of signicicant midline shift 
(overall slight leftward shift) concerning for blood as patient 
was status-post embolization. IP then spirated long obstructing 
blood clot from R main stem beginning at level of tumor. She was 
then stable in the ICU and transferred to ___ for further 
observation. She again had respiratory distress and was 
transferred back to the ICU, until finally, she decided to be 
CMO and was transferred back to the OMED service. She then had 
respiratory depression/failure and passed away at 5:59PM on 
___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ yo M w/ cognitive dysfunction after resection 
and XRT for R temporal lobe astrocytoma on anticoagulation for 
hx of PE who presented with urosepsis, hypoxic respiratory 
failure, and acute renal failure.

ACUTE ISSUES:

# Urosepsis: Evidenced by abnormal urinalysis with all SIRS 
criteria including tachycardia, leukocytosis (WBC 22.5), 
tachynpea, and fever to 102.2, with evidence of end-organ damage 
including ___, respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and 
hypotension meeting criteria for severe sepsis. He was given 4 L 
IVF ___ ED, central line was placed and he was started on early 
empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, cefepime, and 
levofloxacin. He briefly required phenylephrine and this was 
quickly weaned. He was continued on cefepime (day 1 = ___. 
However, his final urine culture only grew yeast.  He was 
treated briefly with fluconazole.  His catheter was changed and 
repeat urine culture was negative at which point fluconazole was 
discontinued. He received 14 day course of vancomycin ending 
___.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely ___ MRSA PNA as well as 
severe sepsis. He was intubated ___ the ED for hypoxia. He was 
quickly weaned to minimal ventilatory settings but he had 
copious secretions and no gag reflex which limited the ability 
to extubate him. He was extubated on ___ successfully and 
without complication.  He was continued on vancomycin for a 
total a 14 days for MRSA PNA.

# Bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple kidney stones: possible 
source of infection. He underwent bilateral ureteral stent 
placement on ___. Stones were sent for analysis and 
pathology was pending at time of discharge.  He should follow-up 
with urology as an outpatient for further management.

# Acute renal failure: Likely secondary to severe sepsis and 
hydronephrosis. His renal failure improved with IVF and stent 
placement. He was initially hyperkalemic and this improved with 
kaxeylate.  He Cr slowly improved after placement of bilateral 
urethral stent as outlined above and was 2.3 prior to discharge.
 
# History of PE: On chronic warfarin therapy. INR briefly 
supratherapeutic to 6 and warfarin held. INR was monitored

STUDIES: 
===========================
+ CXR ___: In comparison with the study ___, there is 
again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with 
pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and compressive 
atelectasis at the bases. 

+ CXR ___: Slight increase in mid to lower lung opacities 
due to moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying 
atelectasis ; associated moderate pulmonary edema is seen as 
well. Underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude although 
no discrete focal consolidation is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal 
silhouettes are grossly stable.  IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral 
pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis with mid to lower 
lung opacities increased compared to the prior study. Moderate 
pulmonary edema.  

+ TTE ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial 
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal 
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal 
inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments 
contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). The estimated cardiac index is 
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The 
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Promient concentric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of CAD (PDA 
distribution). Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Increased 
PCWP. 
In the absence of a history of prominent systemic hypertension; 
these findings are suggestive of amyloid cardiomyopathy (or 
other infiltrative disease).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, the severity of mitral regurgitation 
is now slightly higher and left ventricular hypertrophy is 
slightly more prominent. The rhythm is now atrial fibrillation 
(previously with a relatively small A wave also suggestive of 
amyloid cardiomyopathy).

+ FAT PAD BIOPSY: pending at discharge.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with h/o CHF (EF 40%, ___, non-ischemic CM 
(hypertensive vs. amyloid), HTN, COPD (Gold II with no home O2 
requirement), and new diagnosis of Afib in ___ on ___ who 
presented with decompensated HF. His new diagnosis of A-fib in 
___ is likely the etiology of his exacerbation. 
Concern for AL vs. senile amyloid given MGUS with a prominent 
kappa spike. UPEP showed trace monoclonal free kappa (below the 
limit of quantitation by UPEP). An abdominal fat pad biopsy was 
taken to rule out amyloidosis and was negative. Heme-Onc was 
consulted and arranged outpatient follow-up appointment. His 
home dose of amlodipine was held throughout the admission due to 
concern for amyloid. Carvedilol was given for rate control until 
DCCV and was held thereafter. Patient was diuresed with Lasix 
40mg IV PRN until euvolemic, when he was transitioned to 
Torsemide 20mg PO daily to take an extra 20mg if he has gain in 
weight. 
 
Patient received a new diagnosis of Afib in ___ and was 
started on Xarelto, which was held during his hospitalization in 
preparation for the abdominal fat pad biopsy. He was given a 
heparin gtt in the interim, and Xarelto was restarted on ___ 
after the fat pad biopsy and successful DCCV. Following DCCV, 
patient converted to NSR, HR ___. Patient was started on 
Amiodarone 400mg BID x25 doses (10g loading), then 200mg daily.

For the patient's COPD, his home doses of tiotropium and 
albuterol nebs prn were continued while in-house. 

For HTN, the patient's home dose of lisinopril was continued 
in-house. 

Transitional Issues:
===============================
- Added amiodarone 400mg BID x25 doses (10g loading) after DCCV; 
after loading, dose will be 200mg daily
- Amlodipine and carvedilol stopped due to concern for amyloid. 
___ restart them in the outpatient setting since fat pad biopsy 
was negative
- Outpatient appointment with Heme-Onc to work up MGUS
- At the request of Dr. ___, Mr. ___ will be 
___ by Dr. ___ Dr. ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization. 

You came to us with shortness of breath when you walked. We gave 
you IV medicine to get rid of the extra fluid in your lungs. 
Before we discharged you, we started you on a water pill called 
Torsemide to prevent fluid from building up again. Please take 
this new medication every morning. 

We took a piece of your belly fat to see whether or not you have 
an abnormal protein that can build up in your heart, and the 
biopsy was negative. 

Since you had an abnormal and fast heart rate when you came to 
the hospital, we shocked your heart to put it back in normal 
rhythm. We also gave you a medicine called Xarelto to thin your 
blood and a medicine called Amiodarone to help your heart stay 
in normal rhythm.

We kept you on the medicines you take at home for your COPD. You 
were on oxygen in the hospital, but your lungs improved once the 
extra fluid in them was gone. You will not need oxygen at home.

Please take all of your medications as prescribed and follow-up 
with your PCP and ___.  

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

ARTERIOGRAMS: 
  
FINDINGS:  
Right common carotid artery:  Was well visualized and was of 
mild tortuosity.  The anterior intracranial circulation is well 
visualized.  The distal internal carotid arteries well 
visualized the peak stress, lacerum, cavernous, clinoid, 
ophthalmic, and communicating segments do not show any 
abnormalities.  A infundibulum is associated with a small 
posterior communicating artery.  The middle cerebral artery is 
well visualized as is bifurcation.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
are identified.  The anterior cerebral artery is well 
visualized.  The anterior communicating artery is also well 
visualized and appears to have 2 infundibuli, from which 2 small 
vessels can be seen emerging, this is best appreciated on the 
three-dimensional reconstructions.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
were detected.  An early draining veins or intracranial to 
extracranial shunting can be identified. 
  
Left common carotid artery:  Was well visualized was of small 
tortuosity.  The anterior intracranial circulation well 
visualized.  The distal internal carotid artery was well 
visualized, the peak stress, lacerum, cavernous, clinoid, 
ophthalmic, and communicating segments did not show any 
abnormalities.  E termination is normal.  The middle cerebral 
artery is well visualized as is bifurcation and does not show 
any aneurysmal abnormalities.  The anterior cerebral artery is 
well visualized not show any abnormalities.  The anterior 
communicating artery is again noted.  And again the infundibula 
are noted with the small vessels imaging from the tip.  Again 
this is best appreciated on the three-dimensional rotational 
angiography reconstructions.  No aneurysmal abnormalities are 
detected.  Note early draining veins or intracranial to 
extracranial shunting identified. 
  
  
Left vertebral artery:  Is well visualized and is of small 
tortuosity.  
Bilaterally the posterior cerebral arteries, superior cerebellar 
arteries and anterior inferior cerebellar arteries are well 
visualized bilaterally and did not reveal any aneurysmal

Chief Complaint:
RLE edema, started 1 month ago, now worse x 1 week
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Debridement and bone biopsy of right foot
 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo M with a h/o DM2, HTN, gout, and Hyperlipidemia 
who presents with worsened RLE ankle edema x 1 week. The patient 
has noted increased RLE edema x 1 month. He says that this all 
started in ___, after he was treated for a SSTI 
following a vesicular rash. The patient was treated for ___ 
cellulitis at that time. Since then, the patient has had 
continued unilateral swelling of his right ankle with some 
hyperpigmentation of the ankle as well. Two weeks prior to 
admission, the patient was treated with another course of 
antibiotics including a vancomycin dose in the ED and then a one 
week course of outpatient therapy with Bactrim and Keflex. The 
patient notes that the swelling slightly improved on the ABX, 
but has now recently worsened x 1 week after stopping the 
medicine. The patient has a history of gout, but denies that 
this feels like a typical gout flare. The patient denied any 
trauma to his RLE. He has no cuts or skin breakdown of that 
foot. He has not had fevers, chills, or rash. The patient denies 
pain of his foot or weakness, numbness, or loss of sensation. He 
does intermittently get a shooting pain in the ball of his foot. 
His gait is normal. 

In the ED, the patient's VS were 97.4, 97, 152/72, 20, 97% RA. 
The patient had LENIS that were negative for clot. The patient 
had a R foot film that showed cortical destruction of the ___ 
metacarpal. He was given 1 dose of vancomycin and transfered to 
the floor for further management.  

On arrival to the floor, vitals were 97.2, 148/80, 75, 22, 99%. 
The patient only notes symptoms per HPI.

Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI: chronic shortness of breath
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or 
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or 
congestion. Denied cough. Denied chest pain or tightness, 
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or 
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No 
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
 
Past Medical History:
1.  Diabetes, followed at ___.
2.  Hyperlipidemia, on statin.

IMAGING:
___ LENIs: 1. No right lower extremity DVT.
2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema.

___ R foot x-ray: Increased fragmentation and destruction 
of the first metatarsal head with adjacent soft tissue 
calcification/heterotopic ossification and periosteal new bone 
formation. Findings may represent a traumatic fracture/crush 
injury and correlation with history is recommended. 
Osteomyelitis with extensive bony destruction is also a 
consideration, though the base of the proximal phalanx is 
relatively spared, given the extent of destruction of the first 
metatarsal head. Additionally, the location at the first MTP 
joint is a typical area for gout, though, the typical erosions 
seen in gout are not present in this case. 

___ MRI of foot: 1. Fluid collection centered in the first 
MTP joint with also adjacent marrow edema involving the proximal 
first phalanx and first metatarsal which deomonstrates 
periosteal elevation with associated  heterogeneous 
rim-enhancing collection adjacent to the first MTP joint 
measuring approximately 1.8 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm. The appearance is 
highly suggestive of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. The 
differential includes fracture/Charcot osteoarthopathy, but that 
is considered less likely. This may represent complex early 
abscess formation superimposed possibly on a background of 
tophaceous gouty arthritis given clinical history and in 
correlation with plain film findings. (Alternatively soft tissue 
calcification could represent bony debris.) Cortical 
irregularity at the distal first metatarsal and erosive change 
at the plantar aspect of the distal first metatarsal may all be 
related to an infectious process, however, there also appears to 
be fracture deformity involving the distal first metatarsal.
 
2. Small rim-enhancing heterogeneous fluid collection just 
dorsal to the
second tarsometatarsal level subcutaneous soft tissues measuring 
approximately 5 x 8 mm may represent another separate pocket of 
infectious material.
 
3. Extensive subcutaneous soft tissue swelling and enhancement 
surrounding
the first MTP joint soft tissues may reflect changes of 
overlying cellulitis with also mild soft tissue enhancement 
extending into the the sinus tarsi.

MICROBIOLOGY:
___ BCx: NGTD
___ joint fluid: negative gram stain, cultures NGTD
___ bone biopsy pending

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with a h/o HTN, DM2, gout, and multiple admissions and 
treatment for a RLE cellulitis who initially presented with 
acute on chronic swelling of his right forefoot. He was treated 
with IV antibiotics and evaluated by podiatry with debridement 
and bone biopsy of his R foot. Patient improved symptomatically 
and is being discharged to home with PO antibiotics. 

# R foot edema: The patient has noted worsened swelling since 
his last antibiotic course of Bactrim and Keflex finished 1 week 
prior. On admission, it was unclear whether the patient has a 
cellulitis as his foot did not have warmth, tenderness, or 
erythema. The patient had full ROM and did not complain of any 
pain with active or passive motion, making joint involvement or 
gout attack unlikely as well. However, his R foot xray showed 
some cortical destruction, with possible question of 
osteomyelitis, so MRI of R foot was done and podiatry was 
consulted. His CRP and ESR were elevated (41.3 and 116 
respectively). He was started on IV vancomycin. He never 
developed fever or leukocytosis. 

# Type 2 DM: He was initially covered only with SSI with his 
blood glucose in 300s. His home NPH regimen was started with 
improved blood glucose control, however, patient did have an 
episode of hypoglycemia to 46 while he was NPO for his 
debridement. He was asymptomatic, and was treated with oral 
glucose gel. Otherwise his blood glucose did ok on his home 
regimen.

# HTN: Patient with documented history of hypertension, but not 
on any antihypertensives. His vitals were monitored during this 
hospitalization and patient did have episodes of high blood 
pressure in the mornings, which improved throughout the day. 
Though he would benefit from ACE-I ___ given his diabetes, he 
has documented allergies to both of them. 

# Gout: His R foot swelling were not consistent with gout attack 
in that it was painless and he had good range of motion. 
Arthrocentesis of first metatarsal joint was done by podiatry to 
rule out gout and did not show any crystals. Per records, 
patient was told to stop taking allopurinol as he had stopped 
taking it on his own and did well without flare. However, 
patient states that he has been taking allopurinol daily at home 
anyway. His allopurinol and colchicine were initially held on 
admission, but patient complained of some L knee pain, so 
allopurinol was restarted. Patient will continue to follow with 
rheumatology (next visit beginning of ___) for his gout.

He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, gout, and hyperlipidemia. He was treated for a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) following a vesicular rash and was given antibiotics, including vancomycin and Bactrim, which improved his symptoms initially but worsened them after stopping the medication. 

The patient's physical examination revealed 2+ pulses in both legs, 2+ non-pitting edema of the RLE to the ankle, and some hyperpigmentation of the skin. He had a normal gait and full range of motion in his right foot, with no pain with active or passive movement. 

Laboratory results showed elevated sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, indicating an inflammatory process. Imaging studies revealed cortical destruction of the first metatarsal head, which may represent a traumatic fracture/crush injury or osteomyelitis. An MRI of the foot showed fluid collection and marrow edema, highly suggestive of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.

Colonoscopy

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M w/ h/o aortic disease, critical AS, CAD 
planned for CABG and AVR the day after admission ___ who 
presents with BRBPR. Of note, the pt had a cardiac cath ___ 
which showed 80% LAD and bifurcated diag with >70% stenosis in 
both poles. Post op course was complicated by formation of a 
pseudoaneurysm. Pt presented to the ED ___ with complaints of 
increase in size of groin hematoma. At that time, US showed no 
flow into pseudoanaerysm which was thought to be thrombosed. Pt 
was sent home by ___ surgery from the ED. 
.
On ___, pt was constipated and took prune juice resulting 
in a BM. When he wiped, there was some blood on the toilet 
paper. In the evening ___, pt had BM, noted blood on the 
toilet paper and also around the mostly brown stool. In ED pt 
had a streaky brown marroon stool. Initial vitals were T 98.5 P 
82 BP 129/37 R 15 O2 sat 100 on RA. There, he was found to have 
HCT 24.5 from 26.6 2 days prior. Of note, pt had cauderization 
of cecal AV malformation at an OSH in ___. In the ED, the pt 
became hypotensive from BP 130/37 on arrival to a low of SBP 86. 
HR ___ rose from to ___ (pt is normally not on any beta blocker 
at home). At no time in his ED course was the pt symptomatic 
although he did admit to fleeting lightheadedness on the day 
prior to admission.  GI was consulted from the ED and 
recommended PPI gtt which was started and transfusion of PRBCs 
for goal HCT>30. They stated they would talk to the ICU team on 
arrival about possible EGD on day of admission. 2 units of PRBCs 
were ordered in the ED and the first hung just prior to transfer 
to the ICU. Pt was given about 2L IVF in the ED. 2 large bore 
IVs were placed in the ED. 
.
In the ED, the pt refused NGT and when this was brought up, he 
began to c/o chest pain. EKG at that time showed ST depressions 
in V2 and V4-6 which were worse from earlier in the day, new STE 
in AVR and the pt was thought to be in an irregular rhythm ? 
multifocal atrial tachycardia. After the pt was told that an NGT 
would not be attempted since he had refused it, his CP resolved. 
Cardiology was called from the ED who said, given the pt's 
bleeding, there was nothing more to do but that they would 
follow the pt in the ICU. Cardiac surgery was also made aware of 
his admission given his planned surgery on ___. 
.
On the floor, pt is c/o ___ left sided chest tightness with out 
lightheadedness, SOB or palpitations. Pt states he has had

___ TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be 
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely 
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
pulmonary artery pressures can be assessed on the current study 
and are mildly elevated. Aortic stenosis remains crtical.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with history of CAD, critical AS planned for 
CABG, AVR presented with BRBPR and demand ischemia.

# Bright red blood per rectum: The patient had a 3 point Hct 
drop in 2 days and 1 maroon stool by report. The patient was 
transfused 3 units of packed RBCs to a Hct over 30. Stool guaiac 
was trace positive in the ICU. GI was consulted and did a 
colonoscopy. They found evidence of hemorrhoids and diverticula 
and one rectal polyp without evidence of active bleeding. The 
patient was discharged with stable hematocrit.

# Chest pain: The patient developed chest pain. He had a planned 
CABG and AVR. After blood transfusion the patient was 
asymptomatic. The patient was continued on his lipitor and 
anticoagulation was held. The patient had a slight cardiac 
enzyme elevation which is likely secondary to demand ischemia. 
The patient cardiac enzymes were trending down at the time of 
discharge. After the colonoscopy the patient was started on 
metoprolol succinate and diovan per outpatient regimen.

# Severe AS: The patient also has significant CAD. He was 
scheduled for a CABG/AVR however developed the GI bleed. He 
remained chest pain free while he was an inpatient in the 
hospital. The patient was continued on the above CAD 
medications. He was evaluated by ___ and scheduled for a 
CABG/AVR in the near future. Plavix and aspirin were held in 
anticipation of the surgery and the recent GI bleed.

# Hypertension: Antihypertensives were held in setting of GI 
bleed. They were restarted at time of discharge.
 
# Dyslipidemia: Continued statin.

cxr on admission
The previous study demonstrates the presence of 
pneumomediastinum with no 
substantial pneumothorax present.  The current chest radiograph 
redemonstrates small amount of pneumomediastinum with no 
definitive evidence of pneumothorax, corresponding to the prior 
imaging.  Extensive involvement of the lungs by interstitial 
fibrosis as well as low lung volumes is noted.  Heart size and 
mediastinum are unremarkable in appearance.  Elevated right 
hemidiaphragm is noted, chronicity unknown. 

CXR on discharge
Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Bibasal 
atelectasis have 
substantially progressed in the interim, in particular in the 
right lower lobe where there is currently evidence of 
atelectasis potentially of the entire lobe as well as apical 
pneumothorax.  No subcutaneous air is demonstrated.  No interval 
development of new consolidations besides the right lower lobe 
atelectasis demonstrated.  The right lower lobe consolidation on 
the other hand can reflect area of aspiration or rapidly 
developing infectious process, although it is less likely. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ without significant PMH, who presented with ~10 days SOB 
requiring O2 and findings consistent with pulmonary fibrosis and 
a small pneumothorax. 

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: 
Mr. ___ was admitted from ___ urgent care following 10 
days of shortness of breath and a failed trial of antibiotics 
for presumed pneumonia. On CTA at urgent care, he was found to 
have fibrotic, honeycombing lung markings, a small pneumothorax, 
and concern for pneumomediastinum. Initially, he was placed on 
4L O2. Pulmonology was consulted. They recommended an initiation 
of ILD work-up, including PFTs (showing restrictive pattern) and 
multiple serologies. They also recommended Thoracics consult in 
order to procure a lung tissue biopsy. VATS was performed, and 
post-operative management included pain control with oxycodone 
and Tylenol. Pt was encouraged to use incentive spirometry. 
Prednisone 60mg and Bactrim ppx was initiated prior to 
discharge. Patient was ambulatory, AFVSS, and relatively 
pain-free upon discharge. PCP and ___ outpatient 
follow-up appointments were scheduled. 

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1) IPF: Increased SOB, radiological evidence of IPF 
(honeycombing, fibrosis) and pneumothorax. Pulmonary was 
consulted, and they initiated a diagnostic work-up including 
serologies, PFTS. They recommended tissue Bx, so Thoracics was 
consulted. VATS biopsy was performed without complication. A 
chest tube was placed. CXRs following the procedure showed 
resolution of post-procedural pneumothorax. Throacics was 
comfortable with pulling the chest tube. There was one night 
where Pt desaturated to the ___, requiring nebs. There were no 
further respiratory issues. Prednisone 60mg was initiated, and 
will be maintained until follow-up with pulmonology. Following 
pred initiation, patient was hyperglycemic to 185. He was sent 
home with a Glucometer and education. He was discharged with 
supplemental O2. While on steroids, we also started calcium/vit 
D, omeprazole, as well as bactrim ss daily for pcp ___.

2) Hyperglycemia: In the setting of steroid usage.  Taught how 
to use a glucometer, and written for one at time of discharge.  
Asked to check blood glucose daily and to call his PCP (new at 
___ if >200.  No insulin required while in house.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of HTN, IDDM, 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45% s/p recent 
hospitalization for VF arrest with ICD placement after arctic 
sun protcol, nonobstructive CAD, and ESRD on HD who is 
transferred to the emergency room from her rehabilitation center 
for a low hematocrit. 

The patient was recently admitted on ___ status post cardiac 
arrest while at dialysis, thought to be secondary to hypokalemia 
with a presumed R on T phenomenon lead to VT --> VF arrest.  She 
underwent Arctic sun cooling and re-warming, successful 
extubation following prior failed attempt (required 
re-intubation due to mucous plugging), and gradual recovery of 
her baseline mental status, after frequent 
work with ___ and speech and swallow to resume PO intake. She was 

dialyzed in-house by the renal team with a high K bath to 
maintain her K around 5. EP placed a single chamber ICD (despite 
significant concerns regarding her multiple comorbidities). She 
had 
evidence of significant ectopy on telemetry throughout her 
hospitalization including frequent PVC's and occasional runs of 
NSVT. She was discharged to rehab for continued recovery of her 
physical function. 
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2 85 157/73 18 100% 2L.  She 
received 1 unit pRBCs for a hematocrit of 22.2.  Other labs were 
notable for a BUN/creatinine of ___, bicarb of 33, Trop of 
0.08 in the setting of CRF, and a hapto <5 with normal bilirubin 
and slightly elevated LDH at 330.  Most notably, she felt unwell 
and her glucose returned at 35.  She was given D50 and a repeat 
fingerstick was 158.  Repeat at 12:15 = 60 and she was given

given and she also ate a ___ sandwich.  Another repeat at 
2:45 = 45 and one more amp of D50 adminstered.  Total D50 amps 
x4.  She was also complaining of worsening chest pain with EKG 
showing no change from prior and improvement with morphine.  CXR 
showed no acute process.  She was given Protonix 40mg IV for ?GI 
bleed.  She is admitted to the ICU for persistent hypoglycemia 
in the setting of receiving her long-acting insulin at rehab 
without eating.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she reported that she was itching since 
the blood started.  Also, she denied hematochezia, hematemesis, 
hematoptysis, and menstruation.  She reported that she has been

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of 
hypertension (HTN), insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM), 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45% status post recent 
hospitalization for vfib arrest with ICD placement, and end 
stage renal disease (ESRD on HD), now presenting with a low 
hematocrit and persistent hypoglycemia.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Persistent hypogylcemia:  Patient states that she did get her 
4units of long-acting insulin + 10units humalog at the rehab 
night prior to admission as well as 8units humalog in the 
morning.  After this, she did not have anything to eat.  She has 
a history of being very sensitive to insulin.  She was treated 
with IV fluids with dextrose 5% in half-normal saline and her 
blood sugars were measured every 1 hour in the ICU.  Also, she 
was able to eat a diabetic/cardiac diet.  She corrected her 
sugars quickly and was able to start her home insulin regimen.
.
# Acute on chronic Anemia: She recieved one unit of packed RBCs 
in the emergency department.  The differential includes gradual 
downtrend secondary to kidney disease and nutritional 
deficiencies vs. source of bleeding or intravascular hemolysis.  
She denies any bleeding outside the body and does not endorse 
pain consistent with internal bleeding.  Although her 
haptoglobin was very low and her LDH was mildly elevated, her 
other hemolysis labs (Tbili, INR) were not consistent with 
ongoing hemolysis.  Her RDW was already elevated which argued 
against an acute bleed.  Also, she has an MCV in the range of 
98-100s which suggests chronic synthetic deficiencies including 
B12 and folate, or mixed picture anemia. Further review of her 
past hamtocrits shos that she had an acute drop following 
placement of her ICD likley related to per-procedural blood 
loss. She was given 2 units PRBCs at dialysis on the day of 
discharge. 
.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post ICD: Significant 
history which we think is due to prolonged QT interval and then 
electrolyte abnormalities, known to have minimal coronary artery 
stenosis.  Continued home BB, ACE-i, statin, and ASA.
.
# ESRD on HD:  Cause is likely combination HTN/DM nephropathy.  
She was dialysed on her schedule with high K bath.
.
# Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine
.
# Epilepsy: continued home antiepileptics
.
# PPD: placed in rehab on ___, read as negative on ___
.  
# Communication: Patient,  ___ (aunt) - ___   
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please continue to make sure that she has high K baths with

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a PMHx of EtOH cirrhosis, 
diverticulosis, and hypertension p/w progressively worsening 
abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
# ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA: CT scan showed mild colonic edema, 
possibly from infectious colitis vs. portal colopathy. Patient 
did not have any bowel movements for the first 24 hours of 
admission, indicating that CT findings were likely due to portal 
colopathy. Although her stools were loose, she was also taking 
lactulose. Abdominal pain may have been precipitated by 
continued alcohol abuse. Diagnostic para revealed 1 PMN. She was 
initially treated with cipro/flagyl, but patient refused these 
medications, and they were discontinued due to low suspicion of 
infection. She will follow-up with gynecology for possible 
pelvic congestion syndrome, which was noted on CT.  

# CIRRHOSIS: Secondary to alcohol abuse. Complicated by portal 
hypertension and ascites with recent hospitalizations for 
decompensation. No history of SBP, varices, or hepatic 
encephalopathy. Patient continues to drink alcohol despite 
emphasis from outpatient providers to abstain and declined to 
see a social worker during this admission. LFTs are consistent 
with continued alcohol use.   

# ASCITES: CT Abd/Pelvis with moderate ascites. Diagnostic 
paracentesis was negative for SBP. She underwent an 
ultrasound-guided therapeutic para draining 1.25L fluid by ___ on 
___. Her home furosemide and spironolactone were continued.  

# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: No history of hepatic encephalopathy. 
Her home lactulose and rifaximin were continued.   

# ETOH ABUSE: History of withdrawal seizures. She was monitored 
on a CIWA during this admission and required doses of diazepam 
initially. She had no complicated withdrawal sx during this 
admission. Folate and thiamine were continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient was concerned about her reducible umbilical hernia. 
Although she remains very high risk for surgical repair, she 
plans to seek a second opinion as an outpatient. This can be 
addressed at liver clinic followup
- Stool cultures pending on discharge
- Continue to encourage alcohol cessation. Patient declined to 
see a social worker during this admission.
- If she continues to be symptomatic, consider colonoscopy as 
outpatient to evaluate area of colopathy vs. colitis
- F/u with Ob-Gyn to evaluate possibility of pelvic congestion 
syndrome as contributor to her abdominal pain
- Patient should have electrolytes and liver labs checked within 
1 week of discharge, sent to Dr. ___ in the ___, 
Phone: ___ Fax: ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for abdominal pain and diarrhea. We initially 
treated you with antibiotics, but these were stopped as we had a 
low suspicion for infection. We drew cultures, which did not 
grow anything while you were here, and checked your stool for 
infection. You tested negative for C. diff, a common infection 
that could cause diarrhea. You should follow-up with your 
gynecologist to address other potential causes of abdominal 
pain. You also underwent a paracentesis while you were here to 
remove some fluid from your belly. 

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were seen at ___ after being transferred from ___ 
after a fall. You had blood in your chest and a chest tube was 
placed. You also sustained a new right 10th rib fracture. Your 
chest tube was pulled after the output was low and your pain was 
managed. You are now ready for discharge to rehab.

* Your injury caused a new 10th rib fracture which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a ___ with unknown ___ transferred from OSH with 
concerning clinical history for DIC, unresponsiveness s/p 
cardiac arrest with ROSC, and new onset seizure.  Patient 
initially presented to ___ after being found unresponsive 
by EMS.  When EMS arrived she had a witness GTC seizure, was 
intubated at the scene. Received fentanyl/versed, intubated with 
etomidate and succinyl choline.  The sequence of events are 
unclear, but her initial BPs were 90/36, 79/27.  She reportedly 
underwent cardiac arrest (likely PEA), and had ROSC after CPR 
with 5 minutes downtime and one round of epinephrine. At ___. 
___ ED, she was noted to be oozing from nose, oropharynx, 
vagina, rectum.  Her labs revealed a WBC 22, Hgb 3.5, hct 10.2, 
plt 93 with 11% bands, creatinine of 6, INR 2.2, LFTs mildly 
elevated, and lactate of 18 on arrival.  UCG negative, no 
tampons found on exam.  Initial ABG 7.19/39/141.  She received 2 
units prbcs, 6 units of FFP.  CT head with no acute bleed but 
chronic R cerebellar infarct.  CT Chest with RUQ consolidation 
and patchy opacities in RML and RLL.  CT A/P had splenomegaly 
and hepatomegaly.  She had a right triple lumen femoral line 
placed.  She was given vancomycin, PPI gtt, levophed.  Patient 
was then transfered to ___ for further management.  

At BI ED initial vitals were 99.8 100/70 110 HR 100%.  Zosyn was 
added on and levophed continued.  She had shaking movements, 
gazing to the left and was thought to have a recurrent seizure.  
She was loaded with keppra and midazolam drip was increased.  
She was noted to be oozing from the aforementioned sites.  Her 
vent settings were CMV 400/20/100%/5 PEEP.  Access is R femoral 
CVL triple lumen, and peripherals x 2.  ED resident planned to 
rescan head to ensure no new process is evolving.  Additionally, 
hematology and neurology were consulted

subsegmental bronchi. Small consolidative peribronchovascular 
opacities are present in the right upper and left upper lobes. 
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. 
  
ABDOMEN: 
The esophagus and stomach are distended with intermediate 
density fluid 
consistent with blood. Extravasated contrast is seen originating 
at the level of the gastroesophageal junction (3b:269) on venous 
phase imaging with contrast jets extending into the stomach and 
distal esophagus. There is pancolonic edema and segmental small 
bowel edema (for example in the duodenum 3b:327). Small bowel 
contents are intermediate density, consistent with blood. 
The colon contains dense intraluminal material consistent with 
contrast from a prior exam. There is evidence of portal 
hypertension with a patent umbilical vein and massive 
hemorrhoids. 
  
The liver is diffusely heterogeneous with a nodular contour and 
regenerative nodules consistent with cirrhosis. No arterially 
enhancing hepatic lesion is identified. The gallbladder is 
decompressed and contains vicariously excreted of contrast. The 
pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. There is 
a wedge-like area of hypoenhancement in the upper pole of the 
spleen, consistent with a splenic infarction. 
  
Intermediate density perihepatic fluid without frank 
hemoperitoneum. No 
retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The abdominal 
aorta and major branches are normal. There is a right common 
femoral catheter. No abdominal wall hernia or pneumoperitoneum.

side-wall or 
inguinal lymphadenopathy. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion 
concerning for 
malignancy.

1. Active extravasation of contrast at the level of the 
gastroesophageal 
junction during venous phase imaging. The stomach and esophagus 
are massively dilated with blood. 
  
2. Cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension including a 
patent umbilical vein and massive hemorrhoids. Pancolonic edema 
and segmental small bowel edema are consistent with portal 
colopathy and enteropathy.

NOTIFICATION:  The emergent finding of GI bleeding was reviewed 
in person with Dr. ___. The final impression was 
discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on 
___ at 5:29 ___, 20 minutes after discovery of the 
findings. 

EEG ___
CONTINUOUS EEG: The background activity varied between what 
appeared to be a significant encephalopathic EEG to one that 
appeared to be associated with persistent stage N2 to N3 sleep. 
During the encephalopathic portion of this record, there is very 
little posterior background rhythm. There is continuous high 
amplitude polymorphic ___ Hz delta activity seen with frontal 
and central predominance admixed with faster theta frequency 
activity over the central regions. During the sleep portion of 
the record, the background is still suppressed posteriorly; 
however, well-formed vertex waves and evolving stage N2 and 3 
sleep was noted. 
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were numerous automated spike 
detections 
predominantly for the vertex related activity. No clear 
interictal Epileptic discharges were identified. 
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no automated seizure 
detections. 
QUANTITATIVE EEG: Trend analysis was performed with Persyst 
Magic Marker 
software. Panels included automated seizure detection, rhythmic 
run detection and display, color spectral density array, 
absolute and relative asymmetry indices, asymmetry spectrogram, 
amplitude integrated EEG, burst suppression ratio, envelope 
trend, and alpha delta ratios. Segments showing abnormal trends 
were reviewed and showed diffuse symmetric encephalopathic 
changes. 
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations. 
SLEEP: See above. 
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an 
average rate of 100-115 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of a moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy with 
attenuation of background frequencies in the presence of high 
amplitude delta activity. However, during portions of the 
record, a relatively normal sequencing of sleep was seen. This 
can happen and may reflect excessive drowsiness in the presence 
of a more mild to moderate encephalopathy. There were no 
lateralized, localized, or epileptic features to the record. 

___ CXR IMPRESSION:  
IN COMPARISON WITH THE STUDY ___, THERE AGAIN ARE LOW 
LUNG VOLUMES.  MONITORING AND SUPPORT DEVICES ARE WITHIN NORMAL 
LIMITS. THERE IS INCREASING BILATERAL OPACIFICATIONS.  ALTHOUGH 
SOME OF THIS MAY MERELY REFLECT CROWDING OF VESSELS AND 
PULMONARY EDEMA, THE POSSIBILITY OF SUPERIMPOSED PNEUMONIA. 
WOULD HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED IN THE APPROPRIATE 
CLINICAL SETTING. 
  
___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
1. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are consistent with 
aspiration in the setting of massive upper GI bleed. 
2. Monitoring and support devices are in the appropriate 
positions. 

ABD DUPLEX U/S
FINDINGS:    
There is a large amount of echogenic ascites with more organized 
thrombus 
around the liver.  Although is difficult to accurately 
quantitate the amount of hemorrhage, the ascites appears 
increased compared to CT of 2 days ago. 
  
The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The TIPS 
is patent and demonstrates wall-to-wall flow with velocities of 
83, 120, and 120 cm/sec in the proximal, mid, and distal 
portions respectively. 
  
MPV is patent with velocity of 29 cm/sec.  The left portal vein 
is not 
visualized.  Flow within the right anterior portal vein is 
reversed. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Hemoperitoneum with more organized thrombus around the 
liver. Although it is difficult to accurately quantitate, the 
amount of ascites appears larger than on the CT of 2 days ago 
2.   Patent TIPS. 

___ CT-A A/P
FINDINGS:  The bases of the lungs demonstrate significant 
atelectasis and 
small bilateral pleural effusions.  Superimposed infectious 
process of the consolidations cannot be excluded. 
  
The patient is status post TIPS with the TIPS stent seen in 
appropriate 
position.  The liver is diffusely heterogeneous with a nodular 
contour and regenerative nodules consistent with cirrhosis.  No 
definite arterially enhancing hepatic lesion is identified.  The 
gallbladder is hyperdense, consistent with excretion of 
contrast.  Redemonstrated is a wedge-shaped area of 
hypoenhancement in the upper pole of the spleen, consistent with 
a splenic infarction, unchanged compared to the prior exam.  The 
pancreas is normal without evidence of focal lesions or 
pancreatic duct dilatation. 
  
The adrenal glands bilaterally are normal.  The kidneys 
bilaterally are normal without evidence of focal solid or cystic 
lesions concerning for malignancy.  
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. 
  
There is a large amount of hemoperitoneum.  On the arterial 
phase, there is a serpiginous structure anterior to the right 
liver which is likely a 
subcapsular vessel which itself is distended secondary to a 
subcapsular 
hematoma.  The terminus of the vessel is irregular on the portal 
venous 
phases.  Active extravasation in this region cannot be excluded. 
 Hyperdense blood is also seen immediately inferior to the 
liver. 
  
Evaluation of the gastroesophageal junction is limited due to 
the embolization particles; however, the stomach is distended 
with hyperdense material concerning for hemorrhage.  
Intraluminal areas of increased density within the small and 
large bowel are also concerning for hemorrhage.  There is no 
evidence of wall thickening or obstruction. 
  
Areas of irregularity within the liver are likely secondary to 
lacerations from the recent TIPS procedure.  There is no 
intra-abdominal free air.  The right common femoral catheter is 
redemonstrated. 
  
CT PELVIS:  The urinary bladder demonstrates a Foley catheter.  
The uterus appears unremarkable. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for 
malignancy are identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Massive Hemoperitoneum with irregularity of a distended 
subcapsular vessel in both the arterial and portal venous phases 
is concerning for active extravasation.  High-density blood is 
seen immediately inferior to the liver. 
2.  Although evaluation of the gastroesophageal junction is 
limited by embolic particles from recent embolization, there is 
evidence of hemorrhage within a distended stomach and remainder 
of the small and large bowel loops.  Active extravasation from 
the gastroesophageal junction cannot be excluded. 
3.  Irregularity of the liver with evidence of lacerations is 
likely from 
recent TIPS procedure. 
4.  Small foci of pneumoperitoneum are likely secondary to the 
recent 
intervention. 
5.  Diffuse anasarca throughout the body. 

___ MRA NECK W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1.       No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2.       Chronic right cerebellar hemispheric infarction, 
unusual in a patient of this age; correlate with more detailed 
clinical information. 
3.       No evidence of hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical 
dysplasia, gray matter heterotopia or other anatomic substrate 
for seizure 
4.       Normal cranial MRA. 
5.       Large amount of fluid within the mastoid air cells and 
sphenoid air cells. While likely related to prolonged 
intubation, this process has 
progressed considerably since ___, and should be correlated 
clinically. 

___ ABDOMEN US
FINDINGS:  
Limited abdominal ultrasound again demonstrates ascites with 
echogenic 
material consistent with thrombus.  There is a large amount of 
echogenic, 
apparently organized thrombus in the lower quadrants.  The 
quantity of 
anechoic, drainable appearing fluid, is small, however.  A 
paracentesis could be performed, but large volume fluid removal 
is not expected to be achieved. 
IMPRESSION:  
Findings again consistent with hemoperitoneum and ascites with 
large amount of echogenic clot within the abdomen with smaller 
quantity of drainable-appearing free fluid. 

___ LIVER ABD US
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  Ascites and 
hemoperitoneum again seen. 
2.  Patent TIPS with velocities similar to ___.      
3.  Hyperechoic lesion in the liver in segment VIII.  MR can be 
done for 
further evaluation when indicated.  

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
Right PICC line tip is deep in the right atrium.  , might be 
pulled back 
approximately 2 cm. TIPS and most likely coils of embolization 
of ___ is are unchanged in appearance. Heart size and 
mediastinum are unchanged as well as bilateral basal 
consolidations.  No definitive evidence of interval development 
of pulmonary edema is present. The right need opacity is 
substantial and might reflect infectious process versus 
atelectasis 

___ CT ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Slight interval decrease in large volume pneumoperitoneum.  
In the absence of IV contrast, cannot assess for superinfection 
or abscess formation. 
2. TIPS in adequate position. 
3.  Anasarca. 
4.  Gallstones. 

___ CT CHEST
IMPRESSION:  
Moderate cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema and 
bilateral pleural 
effusions.  Multifocal pneumonia. 

___ RENAL US
IMPRESSION: 
1. No hydronephrosis. Unremarkable appearance of the kidneys. 
2. Ascites and hemoperitoneum is again noted. 

___ CXR
The tip of the endotracheal tube is 2.6 cm above the carina.  
There is a 
feeding tube with tip and side port in the stomach.  There is a 
right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the right atrium.  
This could be pulled back, 3-4 cm for more optimal placement.  
There are very low lung volumes with atelectasis versus 
developing infiltrates at the lung bases.  There are no 
pneumothoraces.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=======================
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o lady with history of alcohol 
abuse who initially presented with coagulopathy, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, muscosal bleeding, new onset seizure, 
hypotension s/p cardiac arrest with associated respiratory 
failure. She was found to have a large GE junction variceal 
bleed which was stopped with emolization of gastric artery, 
subsequent TIPS. TIPS was complicated by subsequent hepatic 
artery bleed, which caused severe abdominal compartment syndrome 
requiring repeat ___ intervention with embolization of 2 branches 
of hepatic artery.  She was ultimately transitioned to the ICU 
requiring intubation for pending respiratory failure in the 
setting of worsening liver failure (MELD 56), hepatorenal 
syndrome, anasarca, sepsis, and ongoing bleeding.  She was 
eventually made CMO by her family and expired shortly after 
terminal extubation.

# Massive variceal bleed complicated by hepatic arterial bleed - 
Pt presented with massive bleeding from all mucosal surfaces on 
presentation.  Her lower and upper GI tracts prompted an upper 
endoscopy which showed a massive esophageal bleed.  A stat CTA 
showed active extravasation from the GE junction, and she then 
proceeded to ___ for embolization of the gastric artery.  After 
the procedure, she continued to have significant bleeding with 
unstable blood counts and hemodynamics.  She was then referred 
for urgent TIPS procedure which proceeded without complication.  
However, over the next ___ hours her abdomen became massively 
distended and was sent down for a repeat CTA which confirmed 
massive hemoperitoneum as well as probable bleed from the liver. 
 She then went to ___ for a third procedure where they embolized 
2 branches of the hepatic artery.  They also attempted 
paracentesis but did not get substantial drainage has she was 
thought to be clotting off.  However, they did place an ostomy 
bag over the area.  Fortunately, after this final procedure, the 
patient stopped bleeding and was able to continue without blood 
products.  During this course, she received over 29 units of 
blood (massive transfusion protocol utilized), multiple units of 
FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitate.  The family was informed on 
multiple occasions of her poor prognosis.  She was later 
transitioned to CMO with terminal extubation per discussion with 
her family after her liver function worsened and was complicated 
by HRS.  

# Elevated transaminases with direct hyperbilirubinemia: 
Patient's LFTs started climbing on HD 4 after her bleeding 
stopped.  A RUS was obtained which showed TIPS is patent and no 
dilatation.  Transaminitis and elevated hyperbilirubinemia was 
thought to be due to cholestasis of sepsis versus EtOH 
hepatitis. MELD score elevated to the ___.

#Abdominal Compartment Syndrome- Patient's bladder pressure 
rose, peak pressures rose, and O2 sats declined along with 
massive abdominal distention in the setting of her hemorrhagic 
ascites when she bled from her hepatic artery.  She was taken 
for hepatic artery embolization as described above.  Multiple 
attempts at paracentesis did not yield fluid.  She had repeat 
abdominal ultrasounds that confirmed large amounts of clot in 
the peritoneum.  She developed oliguric renal failure not 
responsive to diuresis.

#Acute Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory Failure: Intubated 
in the setting of new seizure for airway protection.  She 
appeared to have aspirated blood given BRB out of ET tube.  Her 
ventilator settings were quite minimal until she developed 
worsening mechanics ___ abdominal compartment syndrome on ___ 
necessitating increasing O2 requirement and hypercarbia.  After 
the compartment syndrome resolved, she was easily extubated.  
However, the patient was again intubated for metabolic acidosis 
and altered mental status (likely hepatic encephalopathy).  Upon 
discussion with her family regarding her poor prognosis, she was 
terminally extubated after being transitioned to CMO.  She 
expired shortly after extubation. 

# Septic and hypovolemic shock s/p PEA arrest. (Resolved). Echo 
did not show cardiogenic component.  She was on pressors for the 
first few days for which she had a trauma line placed in R IJ.  
Most of the shock was likely hypovolemic from massive bleeding, 
although she did grow MSSA from her sputum as above.  Pressors 
were d/c on ___.  She was initially treated with 
vanc/cefepime/acyclovir and also received a dose of doxycycline 
and clindamycin early on (empiric coverage for tick born disease 
and toxic shock syndrome).  She was eventually narrowed down to 
just cefepime when meningitis was thought to be less likely.  
Blood cultures were ngtd. She later developed significant 
diarrhea, and although her C. diff was negative, she was treated 
with PO vanc/flagyl for presumed C. diff infection.   

#Hepatorenal syndrome: Spun urine is mostly bland, few casts, 1 
muddy brown cast c/w ATN.  Improved with hemodynamic 
stabilization initially.  However, patient developed worsening 
renal failure in the setting of her concurrent liver failure, 
consistent with HRS.  Renal function worsened with albumin 
infusions.  Renal was consulted and because of her poor 
prognosis and unlikely irreversible liver and renal function, 
dialysis was not an option.

#New onset Seizures: Head CT x 2 negative for bleed.  Likely 
secondary to either alcohol withdrawal, toxic-metabolic, or 
meningitis.  Her bleeding and hemodynamic issues precluded 
neuro's initial recommendations of MRI/MRA and LP.  24 hour EEG 
showed focal slowing left side but no seizure concerning for 
structural abnormality.  She was initially treated for 
meningitis as above, but therapy de-escalated when clinically 
appeared unlikely.  MRI/MRA obtained which were overall 
unremarkable for cause of seizure.  She was treated with keppra 
1000 mg BID per neuro recommendations. 

# MSSA PNA/VAP: Sputum sample obtained which grew coag pos 
staph.  She was treated with cefepime for an 8 day course.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o CAD s/p CABG, mechanical AVR on warfarin, with 
recent dx pancreatic cancer, now awaiting ___, who developed 
sepsis (biliary) w/ Klebsiella bacteremia, now s/p repeat ERCP 
with two plastic stents placed.

# Sepsis, cholangitis, klebsiella blood stream infection: s/p 
ERCP on ___ which showed constrictition with severe 
post-constrictive dilation. Received stent placement x2. LFTs 
then corrected and he became asymptomatic. At the outside 
hospital ___), he had ___ bottles positive for 
Klebsiella pneumonia (resistant to ampicillin, otherwise 
sensitive, per report. Sensitive to levofloxacin and 
ceftriaxone). Here at ___, he had no positive cultures. He was 
initially on zosyn then narrowed to ceftriaxone. Will receive

PERTINENT IMAGING:
==============
MRI Head ___:
FINDINGS:  Again, a rim-enhancing lesion is seen in the right 
occipital
region.  There is also increased surrounding FLAIR T2 
hyperintensity.  There is ex vacuo dilatation of the right 
occipital horn.  There are chronic blood products in the region. 
 Compared to the prior study, the overall size of the 
rim-enhancing lesion has not changed and the surrounding T2 
hyperintensities have not changed.  However, the enhancing rim 
demonstrates some nodularity and increased thickening.  This 
could represent worsening tumor burden; however, given the 
subtle nature of change, continued followup recommended as 
appropriate.  There is no acute infarct identified.  There is no 
midline shift seen.  No hydrocephalus noted.
IMPRESSION:  Right occipital rim-enhancing lesion again 
identified.  Although the surrounding T2 hyperintensities and 
mass effect have not changed, the rim of enhancement has 
slightly become thicker and demonstrates some nodularity which 
is new since the previous MRI examinations.  This could 
represent new disease versus post-treatment change.  Close 
followup is indicated.  No acute infarcts are seen.

Left upper extremity US ___:
IMPRESSION:
Non occlusive deep vein thrombosis identified in the left upper 
extremity as described above involving the axillary vein, a 
brachial vein and the basilic vein along the course of the PICC.

PERTINENT STUDIES:
==============
EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
due to the
presence of sharp waves over the right central region, 
indicating a possible focus of epileptogenesis in that area, but 
no frank electrographic seizures were seen. The slow, 
disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing and 
frequent bursts of focal right hemisphere slowing was consistent 
with a diffuse encephalopathy with additional focal subcortical 
dysfunction in the right hemisphere, which could be consistent 
with the patient's history of tumor.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This patinet is a ___ man with history of glioblastoma 
off bevacizumab and deep vein thrombosis s/p IVC placement, 
recent extended admission at ___ from ___ who is 
transferred back from rehab for worsening mental status.

(1) Encephalopathy:  Patient presented with acute on chronic 
worsening mental status. Possible causes of these mental status 
changes included infection, seizures, hypercalcemia, and 
progression of disease.  There was no indication of new 
infection; patient remained on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and 
PO vancomycin for C diff (changed to IV flagyl when pt not 
taking PO).  Continuous EEG showed diffuse encephalopathy, no 
seizures.  Head MRI did not show obvious progression of disease. 
Discontinued amantadine and modafinil given potential drug 
interactions and per son's request. Ritalin was started at 5mg 
BID and was increased by 5mg BID every 2 days until reached 25mg 
BID, which was the dose at discharge. Pt was becoming more 
interactive with the ritalin; he got OOB to chair with assist in 
afternoons when family present, and he would exchange short 
words with his family. 

(2) Hypercalcemia:  Past labs showed likely from primary 
hyperPTH and vit D deficiency, however PTH was at normal level 
this admission. Calcium improved with fluids, lasix IV, and 
calcitonin, then remained slightly elevated but stable. Started 
Cinecalcet 30 mg BID. 

(4) Seizures:  Continued dexamethasone 4mg IV QD. Phenytoin 
trough was normal so continued at Fosphenytoin 300 mg PE IV Q8H. 
Keppra level was low so Keppra was increased to 1250 mg IV TID. 

(5) Endocarditis/MSSA Bacteremia:  Continued nafcillin through 
___ (6 weeks therapy). PICC line was removed in right arm 
given erythema, new PICC placed in left arm.

(6) C. Difficile:  Patient had been taking PO vanc at rehab (to 
be continued through nafcillin course on ___, however was 
changed to IV flagyl this admission when pt was unable to take 
PO given mental status. When pt had dobhoff, returned to ___ 
vanco, but dobhoff was pulled so pt was continued on IV flagyl 
through nafcillin course on ___.

(7) LUE swelling:  US showed non-occlusive DVT LUE, L hand 2+ 
edema, stable. Pt was started on treatment dose Lovenox ___ 
BID.

(8) Nutrition:  Patient was tolerating PO about 1 meal daily and 
some oral medication upon most recent discharge prior to this 
admission, however on admission he was not tolerating any food 
PO and was on TPN. NG tube was placed but pt pulled out NG tube. 
Family did not want PEG tube given the risks with anesthesia. 
Dobhoff (postpyloric) with bridle was placed on ___ and pt was 
changed to tube feeds (Jevity 1.5 @ 60ml/hr, water flushes 100cc 
q4hr) and several IV medications changed to PO (started ritalin 
NG, changed back to PO vanc, started cinacalcet NG, changed to 
Keppra NG and phenytoin NG). However the bridle came out and 
dobhoff was pulled out by pt on ___. Radiology attempted to 
replace dobhoff with bridle on ___ but the tube persistently 
went down the bronchus instead of esophagus. Since pt is not 
able to swallow well this makes tube placement difficult, and pt 
consistent pulls at any tube that is placed so another dobhoff 
tube would only be a temporary solution. Switched his 
anti-epileptics to IV and changed back to IV Flagyl from PO 
Vanc. Pt was restarted on TPN. The swallow team saw pt at the 
beginning of this admission, and at the time pt was unable to 
participate with swallow eval, however the swallow team 
recommendations remained the same as last admission 2 weeks 
prior, assuming the patient's swallow mechanisms are unchanged. 
When pt is more alert and able to follow commands, he should 
have thin liquids, puree solids, and meds crushed in applesauce. 


(9) Steriod-Induced Hyperglycemia:  Continued 43 U glargine qHS, 
ISS. Blood sugars were monitored closely and and insulin was 
adjusted in TPN as necessary.

(10) Glioblastoma:  Last received Avastin about 5 weeks prior to 
admission. MRI head shows possible disease progression, but 
unclear whether disease progression is contributing to 
symptomatology.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
(1) Hypertension:  D/c'd hydralazine given possible drug 
interactions and per son's request; BP control reasonable 
without medication.

(2) Chronic DVT:  He has IVC filter. Was on prophylactic lovenox 
dosing, but was increased to treatment dose lovenox given LUE 
DVT, continue for at least 3 months. 

(3) History of UTI:  From last admission, patient appears to be 
colonized with pseudomonas. Urine culture this admission showed 
no growth. Changed foley weekly.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=================
- Patient was recently changed from DNR/DNI to Full code during 
the last admission. 
- Flexiseal was changed ___. To be changed monthly, next on 
___.
- Foley was changed ___. Change foley weekly, to be changed 
next on ___. 
- Continue treatment dose lovenox for LUE DVT for at least 3 
months, through beginning of ___, then consider changing 
back to prophylactic dosing.

RELEVANT STUDIES:
=================

- CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST (___):
1. Multiple air and fluid-filled dilated loops of small bowel 
with near 
complete decompression of distal ileum. Transition point is seen 
in the left mid pelvis adjacent to 9.1 cm necrotic pelvic mass. 
Findings are concerning for early/partial high-grade small bowel 
obstruction which may be secondary to mass effect, adhesions, or 
a metastasis to this region. Mild interloop fluid is noted. 
2. Progression of metastatic disease including a new 4.6 cm 
anterior abdominal wall mass, mild increase in size of pulmonary 
metastases, and increase in size of pelvic mass. 
3. Partially distended urinary bladder with wall irregularity in 
the region of the pelvic mass, infiltration of the bladder by 
the pelvic mass is not excluded. 

- TTE (___): 
2. The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF = 65%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 
2. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the findings are similar. The previously noted ostium secundum 
atrial septal defect was not visualized due to lack of subcostal 
images (patient with bowel obstruction).  

- CT ABDOMEN PELVIS W/ CONTRAST (___):
1.  Small bowel obstruction, with interval progression of 
dilated small bowel loops. The transition point is again seen at 
the level of the large pelvic mass. 
2.  Right lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia or 
aspiration. 
3.  Interval enlargement of the dominant pelvic mass, as well as 
other 
metastatic lesions in the abdomen and pelvis. Multiple pulmonary 
lesions 
appear grossly stable. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with uterine sarcoma who 
presented to the ED with nausea/vomiting and obstipation x 1 
week. A CT of her abdomen showed findings consistent with small 
bowel obstruction, secondary to new pelvic mass from her uterine 
sarcoma, despite recent therapy with gemcitabine/docetaxol, 
which provided temporary symptomatic improvement. She was 
admitted for palliative chemotherapy with adriamycin/ifosfamide, 
and was put on bowel rest with NPO/TPN. She became neutropenic 
after the first round, and responded well to Neupogen. Her 
obstructive symptoms worsened, however, requiring placement of a 
jejunal tube for decompression, leading to relief of nausea and 
vomiting. Repeat abdominal CT showed enlargement of the mass. 
After a family meeting and input from her outpatient oncologist 
Dr. ___ opted for a second cycle of 
adriamycin/ifosfamide. She tolerated it well and was sent home 
on TPN, with ___ services.  

# SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION SECONDARY TO UTERINE SARCOMA: Patient 
presented following vacation in ___ with naueas/vomiting 
and loss of bowel movements. CT abdomen showed a new pelvic 
mass, likely progression of uterine sarcoma. Patient was placed 
on bowel rest and strict NPO until initiated on TPN. A port was 
placed received a surface echo in preparation for chemotherapy. 
Patient was started on adriamycin/iphosphamide  on ___ and 
tolerated the infusions well with negative UAs during treatment. 
Patient was continued on TPN and bowel rest with NGT placed 
following vomiting of feculent material. NGT was pulled 
following nose pain as requested by the patient. She was then 
started on clear liquids with occasional vomiting secondary to 
crampy pain in her abdomen. Gyn oncology was following the 
patient and recommended conservative management. 

After many days of symptom management and persistent nausea, 
vomiting of copious feculent/bloody material, abdominal pain, 
and inability to tolerate clears, a repeat CT was performed 
which showed enlargement of the pelvic mass despite the cycle of 
A/I. A PEJ tube was placed for decompression, which provided 
significant symptom management. Prior to tube placement pt had 
intractable vomiting and had several episodes of tachycardia 
secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO intake, responsive to 
fluid. For this reason her home furosemide was discontinued 
until outpatient follow-up with her PCP.

Gyn/Onc said no surgical options for the mass were available, 
and pt appeared to have failed first cycle of A/I as mass had 
progressed, however the CT was done much earlier than 
anticipated (original plan was to hold off until after second 
round), so it may have been too soon to evaluate effect of 
chemo. Family meeting was held and pt decided, after input from 
Dr. ___ Heme/Onc fellow Dr. ___, as well as inpatient 
oncology team and Palliative Care, that she would like to try 
another round of A/I and hope for better results. Three days of 
treatment were administered, which pt tolerated well other than 
some nausea and vomiting, all UAs were clear. She was discharged 
home on regular diet for comfort, but with TPN and PEJ in place. 
Insulin was added to the nightly TPN the day before discharge 
due to AM blood sugars in the high 100s/low 200s, so pt was sent 
home with glucometer and test strips for ___ self-checks, with 
___ instructions to monitor blood glucose. She got a Neulasta 
shot before discharge. She will be followed as an outpatient by 
Dr. ___.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- A J tube was placed for decompression, not feeding
- She will f/u with her outpatient oncologist regarding future 
chemo
- No longer on furosemide, a previous home medication. Should 
f/u w/ PCP regarding need for the medicine.
- Pt is on nightly TPN. Insulin was added to TPN on ___ due to 
a BS of 232. The following day her BS improved to 144, so she 
was sent home with TPN+10U Insulin. We advised pt to check her 
BS ___.
- We recommend weekly Chem 10 while on TPN

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted for nausea/vomiting and lack of bowel 
movements. It was found that you had a new tumor that was 
obstructing your small bowel. You were started on nutrition 
through your IV and given bowel rest.  You also received 
chemotherapy while admitted, which you tolerated well.  Your 
blood counts dropped and were supported with neupogen shots.  At 
first, your nausea and vomiting and pain were controlled with IV 
medications.  You eventually tolerated a liquid diet.

Later in your hospital course, your small bowel obstruction 
worsened, an on imaging it appeared as if your tumor had grown, 
which caused a worsening of your symptoms of abdominal pain, 
nausea, and vomiting. We had you go to surgery to get a tube 
placed to relieve these symptoms, and gave you another round of 
chemo to try to shrink the mass enough to give you some relief 
from the obstruction. You tolerated the second round of chemo 
well and your symptoms improved with the chemo and the placement 
of the gastric tube. You will continue getting nutrition through 
your IV at home. 

Your blood sugars have been high occasionally in the hospital 
while on TPN, so insulin was added to your IV nutrition. We will 
send you home with a device you can use to test your blood sugar 
___. Symptoms of low blood sugar are shakiness, nausea, 
sweating, palpitations. If you have any of these symptoms or are 
feeling ill, check your blood sugar, eat something, and call 
your doctor for ___ blood sugar less than 80. For blood sugar 
>250, please also notify your doctor.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 50-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting. She has a history of uterine leiomyosarcoma that has metastasized to her lung and has undergone surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. She has also received chemotherapy with gemcitabine and docetaxel, but had to stop due to toxicity. She presented to the emergency department with sudden onset abdominal pain and new abdominal masses, and was found to have three new masses on CT scan. She has not had a bowel movement in a week and has not passed gas. She has also experienced episodes of non-bloody emesis.

The patient's past medical history is significant for menopausal symptoms, fibroids, and a history of open cholecystectomy. She has no history of asthma, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, thromboembolic disease, or breast cancer.

The patient's diagnosis is leiomyosarcoma with metastatic disease to the lung and abdomen. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and bilateral lymph node sampling, and was found to have lymphovascular invasion and positive for desmin.

The patient was treated with gemcitabine and docetaxel, but had to stop due to an allergic reaction to docetaxel. She was also given fluids and CT scans to monitor her disease progression.

The patient's physical exam was significant for a tender abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant, and a superficial mass in the periumbilical area. Her discharge physical exam was similar, with no significant changes.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, neutrophils, and lactate levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Her electrolyte levels were also abnormal, with elevated sodium and potassium levels.

receiving 9 of 14 doses week #1 complicated by neutropenia,
and 10 of 14 doses week #2.  Initial follow up CT scan showed
improvement with regrowth noted on subsequent scans.

He was admitted on ___ for cycle #2 week #1 high-dose
IL-2 therapy, receiving 7 of ___omplicated
by mid-week elevated creatine kinase and troponin levels
raising concern for possible myocarditis.  IL-2 was held
until his labs improved and he was restarted with 1 dose
daily without further cardiac issues noted.

His recovery was notable for lower GI bleeding with admission
on ___.  His hemoglobin and hematocrit were stable and
he underwent endoscopy with antral gastritis noted.
Colonoscopy revealed an erythematous lipoma felt to be
consistent with a source of bleeding.  Biopsies revealed
colonic mucosa and a hyperplastic polyp.  He is now recovered
is ready for week #2 of therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Renal cell carcinoma as above.

acute distress.  Performance status is 1.  VITAL SIGNS:
98.1, 96, 18, 136/85, O2 saturation 100% on room air.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Sclerae anicteric.  Moist oral
mucosa without lesions.  LYMPH NODES:  No cervical,
supraclavicular, or bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2.  CHEST:  Clear
bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Rounded, soft, nontender.  No HSM or
masses.  EXTREMITIES:  No edema.  SKIN:  Intact.  NEUROLOGIC:
Nonfocal.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  WBC 7.6, hemoglobin 14.1,
hematocrit 40.6, platelet count 419,000.  INR 0.9.  BUN 12,
creatinine 1.2, sodium 140, potassium 4.9, chloride 103, CO2
24.  ALT 24, AST 25, LDH 189, CK 144, albumin 5.0, alkaline
phosphatase 55, total bilirubin 0.6.  CK-MB 4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and underwent
central line placement to begin therapy.  He went to
Interventional Radiology for his line placement.  His
admission weight was 113 kg, and he received interleukin-2
600,000 international units/kg based on adjusted ideal body
weight equalling 54.7 million units IV q.8 hours x14
potential doses.  He was placed on telemetry when IL-2
started due to questionable history of myocarditis in his
week #1 of therapy.

During this week he received 2 doses of IL-2 due to note made
of bradycardia with AV conduction block noted on telemetry
during his ___ admission night.  His underlying rhythm was
___, normal sinus brady to normal sinus rhythm with 1st
degree AV block with an irregular rhythm noted, felt
consistent with Mobitz I or ___ rhythm.  Cardiology
was consulted and IL-2 was placed on hold.  Cardiology felt
he was asymptomatic, although he did have intermittent
dizziness which did not correlate with the timing of his
bradycardic episodes.  His systolic blood pressure was
stable.  Cardiology recommended a stress echo which will be
performed as an outpatient.  They felt there was no
indication for a pacemaker placement given his asymptomatic
status.  He does not need formal cardiology followup unless
he has a positive stress test or if his symptoms change.
However, given concern for this newly noted AV conduction
delay, IL-2 was not continued given that this is appeared to
be a new finding since his prior admission.

Of note, he does have a history of AV conduction disturbance
noted after his surgery in ___.

He was discharged to home on ___, without further
treatment with IL-2.  He did develop nausea and rigors from
his ___ two doses of IL-2 improved and resolved at the time
of discharge.  His TSH was noted to be elevated, and he had
increase in his levothyroxine to 150 mcg p.o. daily.  He also
developed some hand and forearm pain during admission
attributed to IL-2 therapy, which improved after IV morphine
and was resolved at the time of discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Alert, oriented, ambulatory.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with his family.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status
post cycle #2 week #2 high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by
___ Mobitz I or Wenckebach atrioventricular block.

DISCHARGE MEDICATION:  Cephalexin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., vitamin

CT scan ___
IMPRESSION:  
1. Complex multiloculated cystic lesion in the right upper 
quadrant may be 
centered in the abdominal wall musculature and extends into the 
superficial 
soft tissues and has a subcapsular hepatic component. Main 
diagnostic 
considerations includes and abscess or hematoma, with neoplasm 
not 
completely excluded. 
2. Large loculated left pleural fluid collection. 
3. Sequela of chronic pancreatitis.  
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of ___  
IMPRESSION:  
1. Considerable interval decompression of left lateral pleural 
fluid empyema, which contains a pigtail catheter, with a smaller 
residual collection. 
2. Considerable interval decompression of extensive fluid 
collection 
extending from the subcutaneous tissues of the abdominal wall 
through the 
intracapsular region of the liver and closely approaching the 
hepatic flexure of the colon. At that point, a small collection 
of enteric contrast is present, perhaps extraluminal or within a 
diverticulum, an appearance of unclear significance.  
3. Mildly hypoattenuating region of the adjacent liver with 
surrounding 
enhancement which may be reactive. Given that the overall 
process is most 
suggestive of an infectious etiology, this hypodense area may 
represent an 
early phlegmon. The liver could be further evaluated with US or 
MR if the 
patient is not improving clinically. On the other hand, if 
short-term imaging evaluation is not felt needed, then follow-up 
examination is recommended in several weeks to ensure that an 
underlying mass is not present. 
3. Atrophy and calcification of the pancreas, consistent with 
known 
pancreatitis. Although not optimally visualized, the upper 
superior 
mesenteric vein appears patent.

1. Ill-defined, enhancing area within the anterior inferior 
right lobe of the liver in communication with the inflammation 
involving the anterior peritoneal cavity and the abdominal wall 
is consistent with early (pre-liquefactive) 
abscess, as suspected on CT. 
2. New loculated fluid collection in the posterior left pleural 
space.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU under care of the surgical 
service on ___.  He was transfused 5 units of FFP for an 
INR of >22, started on vanc/zosyn, serial Hct's were obtained, 
he was NPO with IVF and IV pain medication.  Interventional 
pulmonary placed a chest tube into the left pleural effusion.  
The patient was transferred to the surgical floor in the evening 
___.

___ - Transfused 2 units FFP, an incision and drainage of the 
RUQ lesion was performed at the bedside.  Chronic pain started a 
ketamine drip and a dilaudid PCA for pain control.  A heparin 
drip was started for SMV thrombosis.  His diet was advanced to 
regular.

___ - A repeat CT scan demonstrated a decrease in both 
collections.  Antibiotics and heparin drip were continued. ID 
was consulted and they recommended HIV testing and TB cultures.  
The patient was placed on respiratory precautions for rule out 
TB.

___ - Underwent successful VATS/decortication of his left 
pleural space with Dr. ___. 

___ - An MRI was obtained to evaluate for a liver abscess.  
It revealed an area in the liver that was consistent with a 
phlegmonous change and that this appeared to communicate with 
the abdominal wall abscess.  He was taken to the operating room 
on ___ for an abdominal wall wound exploration.  The I&D 
incision was extended and the abscess cavity was debrided and 
irrigated.  It did not communicate with the abdominal cavity or 
liver.  He was transferred to the ___ 
post-operatively.  He underwent dressing changes twice a day for 
the next few days and then a wound vac was applied to the 
abscess cavity.  During this time his left chest tube was taken 
off pleura-vac suction and changed to a pneumostat.

___ - Tolerating a regular diet. Pain well controlled with 
oral medication. Left Pneumostat chest tube was removed by 
Thoracic surgery. Post-chest tube removal chest XRAY revealed no 
pneumothorax. A wound vac was placed on the right upper quadrant 
abscess site. ID recommends 4 weeks of IV Penicillin G, and 2 
more weeks of PO Flagyl for treatment of CDIFF.

___ - INR remained subtherapeutic at 1.4 on coumadin so 
Lovenonx SC injections were started to bridge him until his INR 
is therapeutic. He was discharged home with Visiting Nurses for 
___ of his wound vacuum dressing. Vacuum dressing was 
removed prior to discharge and a Wet to dry packing was 
inserted. ___ will deliver the vacuum pump tomorrow, and ___

 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 43-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of a RUQ mass and pain, as well as a L pleural loculated fluid collection. He has a history of EtOH-induced chronic pancreatitis, SMV thrombosis, and is on Coumadin indefinitely. He also has chronic abdominal pain and is taking Oxycontin and Percocet. The patient's past medical history includes IDDM, chronic abdominal pain, chronic pancreatitis, SMV thrombosis, insomnia, and h/o alcoholism.

The patient's diagnosis includes a complex multiloculated cystic lesion in the right upper quadrant, possibly an abscess or hematoma, and a large loculated left pleural fluid collection. He also has sequela of chronic pancreatitis.

The patient underwent a tube thoracostomy (pigtail) and incision and drainage of the RUQ mass. He was prescribed medications at discharge, including antibiotics and pain medication.

The patient's physical exam revealed a thin male with a firm, extremely tender, erythematous mass deep to the RUQ scar. He had moderate TTP to palpation in the L hemi-abdomen, though he reported this was baseline. His vital signs were stable, and he was afebrile.

The patient's laboratory results showed an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes, consistent with an inflammatory process. His imaging studies, including CT and MRI, showed a complex multiloculated cystic lesion in the right upper quadrant, a large loculated left pleural fluid collection, and atrophy and calcification of the pancreas.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was marked by a complex and challenging presentation, requiring multiple procedures and a multidisciplinary approach to management. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with IgA nephropathy, with ESRD 
recently started on HD, who was admitted due to fever at HD and 
was found to have MSSA HD line infection complicated by MSSA 
pneumonia.  He was treated with IV antibiotics and was 
discharged home.
.
# Fever: MSSA bacteremia from HD line infection.
Positive blood cultures grew MSSA.  Line was pulled immediately 
and tip grew MSSA as well.  Infectious Disease was consulted and 
followed throughout admission; TTE and TEE ruled out valve 
vegetation.  When sensitivities returned he was changed from 
Vancomycin to Cefazolin given at HD.  His only positive blood 
cultures here are from when he first came to the ED and 
subsequent ones were negative.  Fever however persisted for much 
of the admission (could have been a drug fever as well) but by 
the time of discharge, he had been fever-free for >24H.  Plan 
for total of 4 weeks of Cefazolin (treating for complicated 
Staph infection given that he is an HD patient: day 1 of 
antibiotics was ___, day 1 of negative blood cultures was 
___. Four week course would end ___.  He will follow up 
___ I.D. ___ clinic.

# Multifocal Pneumonia: with cough that is resolving.
Patient had persistent dry cough, with eventual pleuritic rib 
cage pain.  No shortness of breath or hypoxia.  Found to have 
multifocal pneumonia on CTA. Sputum culture with GPCs ___ 
clusters and pairs; the Cefazolin he was on for bacteremia would 
treat this MSSA pneumonia as well.  Prior to discharge, his 
chest was re-imaged to ensure that no complication had developed 
(e.g. empyema or abscess).  His cough was treated with 
Guaifenisin/Codeine and Benzonatate.  He will be followed by 
I.D. ___ clinic and will likely need follow-up imaging to 
ensure resolution of his lung infiltrates.
.    
# ESRD on HD: due to IgA Nephropathy.
He has been receiving HD at ___.  On presentation 
was compensated with regards to volume and potassium.  Phos was 
elevated and he was started on extra doses of Sevelamer with 
snacks.  Continued Nephrocaps.  New tunneled right IJ HD line 
placed on the day of discharge.  Will return to usual HD 
schedule (___).  He will follow up with Nephrology 
after discharge, and also has follow-up with Transplant Surgery 
for planning of more permanent access (fistula).  
.
# Anemia: likely from CRI, required transfusions.
He has required multiple transfusions ___ the past, most likely 
due to CRI. He gets Epogen with dialysis but did not receive 
this ___ the hospital.  His Hct was near 20 (goal ___ theory is 
>21) - no lightheadedness or shortness of breath.  CT 
abdomen/pelvis ruled out r-p bleed.  He was guaiac negative.  
Not hemolyzing.  His anemia was felt to be due to CKD and he was 
transfused a total of 4 units pRBCs during HD.  He will receive 
Epogen again as an outpatient.  Hct was 27 at the time of 
discharge.
.  
# HTN: SBP at goal while on medication.
When his Lisinopril was held for concern that he may be having 
an ACE-inhibitor related cough, his SBP was out of control (up 
to 190) but when he was started back on his home regimen, SBP 
was better controlled.  He was continued on Lisinopril and 
Labetalol.
.

-Code Status: Full Code
-Emergency Contact: Father ___
-Barriers to care: Patient frequently DNK's appointments; the 
importance of coming to outpatient appointments was emphasized 
throughout admission

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Pulmonary embolism - POD2 Patient was experinecing increased 
O2 requirement. Poor air flow through lungs, gave Lasix with 
minimal effect. CXR unremarkable. CTA showed small subsegmental 
PE. Started on Lovenox ___ BID -> Coumadin.

2. Geriatrics consult for co-management ___ PE.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.

IMAGING
=======
___ CXRAY 

Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are new from 
prior.  The lungs
are clear and hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation, large 
effusion or
pneumothorax.  No signs of congestion or edema.  The 
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable with top-normal heart size.  Bony 
structures are intact. 
No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.

___ Cath Report  

Coronary Anatomy

Dominance: Right
 LIMA-LAD: There was a suggestion of a calcified ledge at the 
origin of the left subclavian artery (whichsubsequently impeded 
advancement of the 4 ___ MP catheter). A careful hemodynamic 
pullback across the origin of the left subclavian artery was not 
performed. The initial left subclavian SBP was about 10-20 mm Hg 
lower than the subsequent LVSP, but change in sympathetic tone 
from agitation and pain
could not be excluded as the cause of the higher SBP later. The 
LIMA was of modest caliber and appeared to attach to a mildly 
diffusely diseased native LAD. It could not be engaged 
selectively due to
an unusually oriented origin.

 LMCA: There was an ostial 40% LMCA stenosis and a distal 30% 
stenosis.

 LAD: There was a 20% near-ostial LAD plaque. The mid LAD 
tapered to 40% after S1. There was a
calcified 75% stenosis after D1 followed by another mid LAD 50% 
stenosis. Competitive flow was seen in
the distal LAD. The distal LAD wrapped around the apex.

 LCX: There was a retroflexed 50% ostial stenosis followed by a 
calcified 75% angulated stenosis.
OM1 was of only modest caliber. OM2 had an origin 50% stenosis 
and a proximal 60% stenosis. The
terminal AV groove CX had a 50% stenosis and supplied 
collaterals to the RPLs and terminal AV groove
RCA. No competitive flow was seen in the native CX system.

 SVG-OM: The SVG-OM was stump occluded.

 At this point, the patient became more uncooperative, giggled 
inappropriately, continued her attempts to sit up, moved both of 
her arms (with backing of the radial sheath out of her wrist). 
She complained repeatedly of left arm pain, especially with 
attempts at catheter manipulation (even after IA TNG and 
verapamil and switching to 4 ___ catheters; the 4 ___ JR4 
kinked outside the body, and the 4
___ MP could not advance out of the left subclavian artery 
into the aortic arch without resistance and pain). The patient 
repeatedly requested termination of the procedure. After 
difficulty advancing the 4 ___ MP, the procedure was aborted, 
and a TR Band was applied to the LRA with good hemostasis. 

Intra-procedural Complications: None

Impressions:
1. Known native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction assessed after 
LIMA angiography.
3. Patent LIMA onto a mildly diffusely diseased LAD.
4. Occluded SVG-OM.
5. Native RCA and SVG-RCA not evaluated due to difficulty 
engaging these vessels, patient discomfort
and repeated requests to terminate the procedure. Given the 
severity of the native RCA disease, it
would not be surprising if the SVG-RCA was also occluded.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
___ y/o female with a PMH significant for HTN, HLD, mild 
dementia, hyponatremia, MV regurgitation and mild AS, CABG 
(___) w/ stress on ___ showing Ischemic EKG changes with 
probable anginal equivalent of exertional shortness of breath & 
arm heaviness presenting from ___ office for concern of 
continued angina. 

# CORONARIES: Now s/p CABG without subsequent cath. 
# PUMP: no recent ECHO in ___ records. 
# RHYTHM: sinus 

#Unstable angina
#CAD
Previous stress test showed ischemic ST changes and she was 
thought to have arm weakness as angina equivalent. Presented 
without chest pain and reported some arm weakness. ECG and 
troponins without evidence of ACS. She went for coronary 
angiogram which was discontinued due to patient 
intolerance/agitation. Before discontinuation, angiogram showed 
mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, Patent LIMA onto a 
mildly diffusely diseased LAD, Occluded SVG-O. Native RCA and 
SVG-RCA were not evaluated. She was placed on optimum medical 
management for angina and discharged with cardiology follow up. 

#Toxic/metabolic Encephalopathy- The evening after the cardiac 
angiogram she became confused and agitated. She was given Haldol 
2.5 x1 and 1.5 x1. The next morning she was oriented and 
mentating at her baseline. 

#Thrombocytopenia- Chronic in nature. 140 on admission. 
Downtrended during admission. 

#HTN- Well controlled on fractionated home metoprolol. 

#Hypothyroidism-continued Levothyroxine Sodium 50 mcg PO DAILY 

#Hyponatremia- 140 on admission. Continue salt tab 1 gm PO DAILY 


# Dysphagia: PER pcp note she has new problem for one month of 
difficulty swallowing and feels as if food gets stuck after 
swallowing. Speech and swallow evaluation no deficits. They 
provided the following recommendations
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1)Diet: Regular diet with thin liquids
2)Medications: Whole with thin liquids

TRANSITION ISSUES
=================
[] Angina- unable to complete angiogram/pci given patient 
discomfort. Pursued medical management with addition of IMDUR. 
Please assess symptoms. If she remains refractory to treatment 
consider future PCI under general anesthesia. Also consider 
addition of ace inhibitor in future if blood pressure allows. 
[]Dysphagia- Speech and swallow evaluated here which showed no 
evidence of aspiration at the bedside. Given reports of food 
sticking, consider further GI work-up.
[]Toxic Metabolic encephalopathy- likely a result of new 
environment/procedure/anesthetic medications. Please monitor for 
any return of confusion. 
[] Please repeat CBC in 1 week to ensure stabilization of 
thrombocytopenia

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
-You were admitted because you had a stress test that was 
concerning for worsening of your heart disease. We were 
concerned that your arm heaviness was due to your heart disease. 


What happened while I was in the hospital?  
-  You underwent catheterization to look at your heart but you 
were not able to tolerate the procedure. The cardiology team 
determined that the best management for your disease would be to 
use medications in the future. 

What should I do after leaving the hospital?  
-  Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary 
and follow up at the listed appointments. 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with ulcerative colitis requiring multiple surgeries 
including total colectomy with ___ complicated by high stool 
output admitted with increasing diarrhea and LLQ pain with labs 
that are unremarkable and a CT scan that shows mild thickening 
and irregularity of the right lateral aspect of the ileoanal 
pouch, seen on ___ prev without an obvious fluid collection. 
Scope showed friable but not clearly inflammed tissue in the 
___ or small bowel. Biopsies showed some inflammation. She 
felt slightly improved, although not at baseline with increased 
___ agents and oxycodone (which she takes at home).

# Diarrhea and abdominal pain: The exact diagnosis is unclear. 
Based on history and biopsy it was suggestive of pouchitis, 
which the patient has had in the past. Other potential 
etiologies include IBS. She was seen by GI and had stool studies 
which were negative. A scope was done with biopsies (see results 
section). She was started on ciprofloxacin and flagyl (as she 
states that this has helped her symptoms in the past). She had a 
decrease in the number of stools and a decrease in her pain to 
the point where she could take orals without difficulty. She was 
given a prescription for oxycodone 30mg q4hrs (she takes up to 
25mg q4hrs at home). She will continue her antimotility agents 
and ciprofloxacin and flagyl until she follows up with her GI 
doctor for further evaluation and management. She also has a PCP 
appointment next week.

# Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her home meds. She will 
follow up with her PCP next week for further management of her 
hypothyroidism.

# myofascial pain syndrome: She was continued on methadone and 
had a slight increase in her oxycodone. She is followed by the 
pain clinic.

TEE ___
Pre-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is 
mild flattening of the interventricular septum in systole, 
consistent with RV pressure overload.

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No 
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. 

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The a3 scallop 
of the mitral leaflet is flail. Torn mitral chordae are present. 
Severe (4+) posteriorly directly mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity 
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 

Post-CPB:
A mitral annular ring is seen, consistent with mitral valve 
repair. There is no residual MR. 
___ left ventricular systolic function remains normal, the EF is 
>55%. The right ventricular systolic function is mildly improved 
from prebypass.
The TR remains mild. Other valvular function remains unchanged. 
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where the 
patient underwent Radical reconstruction, mitral valve with 
NeoChords and size 30 Physio II ring.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable. Low dose Beta blocker was initiated 
but not titrated up due to first degree AV block with PR 
interval 0.34a. The patient was gently diuresed toward the 
preoperative weight. Hydralazine was added for additional blood 
pressure control. The patient was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued without complication. The patient was evaluated by 
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility. Hematocrit had decreased slightly on day of discharge 
(27.2->25.8) and this is to be rechecked by ___ in 2 days with 
results to be called to the cardiac surgery office. He was free 
water restricted for Na 130 and this had increased to 133 on the 
day of discharge. By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient 
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was 
controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged home 
with visiting nurse services in good condition with appropriate 
follow up instructions.

tachycardic into the 150s. She was started on Vancomycin and 
Zosyn ___. JP drain fluid was sent for culture isolating ( 
Vanco sensitive enterococcus and fairly resistant E.coli) Liver 
u/s showed patent vasculature. LFTs continued to increase. Blood 
cultures isolated Ecoli (multi-drug resistant) and antibiotics 
were appropriately tailored. 

On ___, LFTs were worse. A stat CT showed an infected 
collection and areas of necrotic liver. THe patient taken to OR 
and found to have staple line dehiscence requiring a washout, 
oversewing of bowel, and portal venous thrombectomy. Her abdomen 
was left open with vac in place for potential re-exploration on 
___. EBL was 350ccs and she received 3u PRBCs and 1u 
platelets; additional albumin boluses as well as additional 
blood products were required.  Despite these, the patient had 
worsening blood gasses and rising LFTs. Ultrasound could not 
visualize vasculature and so a CTA was ordered; this 
demonstrated improved flow within the main portal vein.  

On ___, the patient remained stable. LFTs were at the time 
downtrending and lactate was improving. Patient was given 1 U 
PRBC, 1 u plts. INR was elevated to 4.2 and so on ___ she 
received 2 units FFP in AM, 1 Cryo, 3gIV Vitamin K. INR goal was 
decided to be ___. She received additional blood products and 
labs were monitored closely.  An ultrasound of the 
liver/gallbladder was ordered and showed minimal portal venous 
flow, although it was a poor-quality study.  

On ___, INR was 2.9 in the early AM; patient received vitamin 
K, and in light of imaging, labs, and clinical picture, patient 
was taken to the OR in ___ for wash-out, liver debridement; there 
was good portal flow and acceptable hepatic artery flow. Seg VII 
was determined to be viable. Abdomen was left open with Apthera 
vac. As for previous and subsequent surgical procedures, for 
full details, please see the dictated operative report.  

On ___ patient continued to receive FFP as needed to keep INR 
<2.5; she was also receiving fat-soluble vitamins given the 
decrease in liver function to secrete bile to absorb Vitamins 
A,D,E,K. Further FFP was required on ___, as well as 1u PRBC 
and 1u Cryo. Repeat CT of the head was within normal limits. 

Patient returned to the OR for repeat washout and completion 
segment VI segmentectomy on ___ with 1u FFP en route to 
OR. TEG was normal intraop, epidural and left femoral cordis 
discontinued in setting of normal coagulation. Previously-drawn 
daily blood cultures were discontinued. After washout, patient 
returned on pressors and continued to require blood products; 
for brevity, patient required frequent intermittent 
administration of blood products including FFP, packed red blood 
cells, and platelets, for the rest of her admission.  

On ___, patient went to ___ for Dobhoff tube advancement and was 
started on tube feeds. She also underwent ultrasound-guided 
thoracentesis with a liter of transudative fluid drained.  

A repeat CT was performed ___ revealing attenuation of the 
portal vein and its branches but patency thereof. Tube feeds 
were held at midnight and patient went to the OR on ___ where 
she underwent revision of the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis, 
placement of an internal stent in the hepaticojejunostomy, and 
fascial closure with SurgiMend biologic material; no further 
resection of the liver was performed.  2 drains were placed, the 
superior above the anastamosis and the inferior in the liver 
bed. 

On ___, Palliative Care was involved with possibility of 
discussing plan/goals of care. Discussion of tracheostomy was 
also initiated.  Hemodynamic management with occasional pressors 
and blood products and respiratory management with the vent were 
continued.  

On ___, patient desaturated to the ___ with CXR demonstrating 
right pleural effusion; a lasix drip was initiated and tube 
feeds were resumed; TID albumin was also initiated.  The lasix 
drip was continued into ___ with excellent diuresis of -3 
liters.  The wound vac dressing was also changed.  

A repeat CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed ___ 
due to fevers of 101; this scan demonstrated right pleural 
effusion with hemorrhagic component and a 10.8 x 8.6 cm fluid 
collection between the rectum and the uterus as well as a 
newly-visualized left external iliac vein clot and a 
non-occlusive thrombus within the left CFV.  The following day, 
___, ___ placed a pigtail catheter into the pleural effusion 
(850cc immediate output) and a trans-vaginal drain into the 
pelvic collection (400cc murky fluid produced).  The lasix drip 
was continued, but in late evening, the patient was 
intermittently hypotensive to ___ - lasix gtt decreased.  

Patient ultimately underwent percutaneous tracheostomy on ___.  
Ms. ___ mental status was improved as well that morning 
when she was intermittently following commands.  She 
unfortunately did not maintain this improved mental status and 
was non-communicative from that afternoon until the end of her 
course; she also intermittently required neo overnight, although 
the lasix drip was continued.  

On ___, Vascular Surgery was consulted for placement of IVC 
filter and requested LENIs of the bilateral lower extremities to 
assess the left common femoral vein thrombus and external iliac 
vein clot seen on the CT scan ___.  The ultrasound study 
demonstrated no evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the 
bilateral lower extremities and so IVC filter placement was 
deferred.  

Over that weekend, the patient's conditioned worsened.  She 
required 3uFFP and a left IJ triple lumen was placed on ___, and 
diffuse oozing from trach and peripheral IV sites was noted on 
___ she received 2u FFP, 1u platelets, and 4 units PRBCs. CT 
chest/torso that day showed evidence of ARDS and small R 
pneumothorax, stable splenic infarcts, portal and hepatic vein 
patent, hepatic artery seen proximally patent; she spiked to 
101.9 and was pan cultured. Pt self d'ced right radial a line; 
left ulnar a-line was placed under ultrasound.  

Repeat CT of the pelvis on ___ for continued fevers showed no 
drainable collection. ID was consulted for sputum cultures 
growing carbapenem-resistant e. coli. Meropenem was switched to 
extended release 1000mg Q8H. Respiratory status worsened, 
possibly secondary to diffuse micro PEs as evidenced by 
apparently absence on ultrasound of the previously seen ___ 
clots, and so ___ was consulted for IVC filter placement, which 
was performed on ___.  Her right chest pigtail catheter was 
also removed.  

Throughout this course, bilirubin had been slowly uptrending.  
Ms. ___ underwent ultrasound on ___ which demonstrated no 
evidence of biliary dilation.  The patient was stated on 
phenobarbital 40 BID for hyperbilirubinemia.  She was febrile to 
101.9 and cultures were sent on ___.  No cultures were 
positive; her last positive cultures were were the sputum 
cultures with e. coli ___. 

Diuresis with lasix drip was continued and she was alkylotic to 
7.50 although only intermittently on pressors. Total bilirubin 
continued to rise despite the phenobarb. and was in the ___ on 
___.  SHe was again febrile to 102 @ 4AM on ___ a family 
meeting that afternoon confirmed the family's understanding of 
the patient's poor prognosis. Phenobarbital was discontinued.  

Over the weekend, the patient was not following commands and had 
persistent tachycardia.  She also was noted on labs to have 
persistant respiratory and metabolic alkalosis and so a hydrogen 
chloride drit was started with lasix held.  On ___, right 
facial ticking consistent with seizures was noted. Patient 
received 6 mg lorazepam and 2 mg midazolam without effect and so 
was bolused 2 g keppra and started 1 g BID. EEG monitoring 
ordered. Patient discussed with ___. and was 
phenobarbital-loaded.  A propofol drip was started and MAPs 
down-trended; Ms. ___ was placed on neo gtt again. 

A head CT on ___ AM showed loss of gray-white matter 
differentiation globally with sulcal effacement, suggestive of 
anoxic brain injury; pupils were noted to be fixed after the 
head CT. Patient was started on a midazolam drip and then was 
started on on a pentabarbital drip. Total bilirubin that evening 
was over 50 with a rising white blood cell count and rising 
creatinine.  A family meeting took place and it was decided that 
there would be no escalation of care, and the patient was made 
DNR. Overnight, she began to require two pressors and so levo 
was added to the already-running neo.  

On the morning of ___, the patient's condition was 
worsening and she required neo, levo, and vaso for blood 
pressure support with systolic blood pressures principally in 
the ___.  The Transplant Surgery and ICU teams discussed the 
possibility of comfort measures only with the family, and Ms. 
___ family, after discussion, elected to enact comfort 
measures only for the patient.  

Pressors and the vent were discontinued and Ms. ___ passed 
away at 14:52 with family at the bedside.  The office of the 
Medical Examiner was contacted and the case was declined.  Ms. 
___ family declined the offer of an autopsy.

EGD: (___)
Findings: Esophagus:  
 Lumen: A sliding small size hiatal hernia was seen.  
Stomach:  
 Mucosa: Segmental erythema of the mucosa was noted in the 
antrum. These findings are compatible with gastritis. Cold 
forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach 
antrum.  
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 
Impression: Small hiatal hernia
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy) 
Recommendations: Continue present medications
Exclude H Pylori
In patient care 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o depression, anorexia nervosa, and gastritis that 
presented with acute on chronic RUQ and right flank pain.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Abdominal pain, RUQ with right flank pain: Given her marked 
CVA tenderness and hematuria, at first this was felt due to a 
small right sided nephrolithiasis. The CT abdomen was equivocal 
but she did have a documented stone on CT at the onset of her 
pain 4 months ago (per report). Review of the CT scan with the 
radiologist however did not feel strongly about ths finding. 
Potentially a small stone may have moved further down her renal 
pelvis causing worsening of her pain. The RUQ (long documented 
history of potential somatic complaints) was initially very 
tender to palpation, however after initiating BID PPi and 
standing GI cocktail, this pain subsided while in house. H. 
Pylori +. EGD (see above) revealed gastritis, but without 
ulcerations. Biopsies were still pending at the time of 
discharge. GU exam was negative for GC/Chlamydia as well as BV 
and yeast.
- Pt sent out with a course of PPI and Maalox. Also given short 
course of tramadol. Instructed to take tylenol (limited to 
4gm/day) instead of ibuprofen (given gastritis)
- Consider checking TTg and IgA as were recommended by GI

# Chronic Gastritis: Not currently on PPI therapy and pain not 
classic for gastritis. Started BI PPi (6 weeks total including 
taper) in house. 

# Microscopic Hematuria: Pt with multiple UAs with >182 RBCs 
(reviewed with nephrology). No RBC casts were seen and she 
displayed no other clinical signs of nephritic syndrome. The 
patient will be following up in ___ clinic in ___.

# Microcytic Anemia: Pt with Hct of 32.8, MCV of 80. Ferritin of 
11. 
- Consider initiation of iron supplementation as outpatient and 
potential further w/u. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- The patient appears to have medical records at multiple 
facilities including ___ and ___.
- No psych consult was called in house given her improvement in 
symptoms
- The patient stated that she had a ""rash"" to tylenol in 
previously, although prior records from ___ indicated that 
she tolerated it well, thus we initiated in house.
- There are prior notes from ___ (___) and ___ 
suggesting the patient has a prior history of 
neurocystercercosis and hepatitis C. We have sent hepatitis 
serologies to confirm.

Chief Complaint:
Right thigh myxoma
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ - right thigh myxoma excision

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a very pleasant
___ gentleman who has noticed this mass in his right
thigh last ___.  It became smaller and so he did not think
much of it as it almost really went away.  This ___, it has 
come
back and he has noticed it on again off again this entire time
and so he presented for evaluation of that.  It is mildly
uncomfortable though not exquisitely painful by any means.  Most
of the time, there is no pain associated with it.  It gets 
larger
and smaller of its own accord in sort of random pattern.  It 
does
not necessarily seem to be tied with activity level or position
of the leg.  He does have a lot of groin pain and a lot of knee
pain, especially startup type pain that has been plaguing him,
but not sure if that is related to this or not.  He recalls
having an issue back about ___ years ago when he had a ganglion

to be 4L NC at baseline), and schizophrenia with akathisia,
presenting from his nursing ___ after an unwitnessed fall. He
received ___ (week 4) yesterday and felt lightheaded 
this
morning.

Notably, he was recently in the FICU for hypoxemic respiratory
failure (___) complicated by AFwRVR, shock requiring
pressors, and agitation, and required intubation. During this
prior hospitalization, Pulmonology was consulted and felt that
his acute decompensation was likely due to limited respiratory
reserve in the setting of radiation-induced lung damage, chronic
pleural effusions, severe emphysema. He was discharged on a
prednisone taper as well as his usual COPD regimen, which
included standing duonebs, tiotropium, advair, guaifenesin BID.
He was found to be at high risk of aspiration. His neutropenia
was thought to be secondary to his chemotherapy.

While in the ED, he was noted to be neutropenic, and chest X-ray
revealed a known right-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis,
though there is a potentially worse opacity on the right lung
base. CT head was negative for any acute process. After his CT
scan he was found to be febrile to 101.7, at which point he was
put on neutropenic precautions. He was given 2L fluids for soft
blood pressures, cefepime, and azithromycin. Afterward, he was
persistently tachycardic and desatted to the low ___ with little
improvement on 8L NC, so he was triggered and intubated. He
subsequently desatted to 84% and became hypotensive to 78/51 and
was started on levophed after having received 4L fluids. He
received midazolam in the ED.

Prior micro data is unrevealing.

CXR ___:
In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and 
support devices are stable.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
unchanged.  Opacification at the right base is again seen, most 
likely related to a combination of pleural effusion and 
atelectatic changes.  However, in the appropriate clinical 
setting, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed 
aspiration/pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral 
view. 

DISCHARGE LABS:
===============
Expired
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with metastatic squamous cell lung carcinoma, COPD, and 
paranoid schizophrenia, who presented with acute on chronic 
respiratory failure, hypotension, and febrile neutropenia.

The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure was felt to be 
multifactorial, in the setting o baseline severe COPD, recurrent 
aspirations, pneumonia, chronic pleural effusions, and post 
radiation injury. He required intubation in the ED on arrival 
and had to be reintubated later in his ICU course.  His care was 
further complicated by severe agitation and progression of 
hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's outpatient oncologist was involved in his care 
while admitted. Given the clinical decline and overall poor 
prognosis, numerous lengthy discussions were had with the 
patient's court appointed guardian and the care teams involved. 
The decision was made to transition comfort focused care. The 
patient was palliatively extubated. He passed away peacefully 
with family at bedside.

2. Left patellar enthesopathy. 
3. Trace right knee effusion.  

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the 
cardiac 
silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Left 
pectoral pacemaker in situ.  Minimal scarring at the left apex, 
normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest 
or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within 
normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No cause of syncope identified. Preserved 
biventricular regional and global systolic function. No 
significant valvular disease.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o HTN, hypothyroidism now s/p MVC and syncope. 

# Syncope: Differential for syncope included vasovagal episodes 
vs orthostatic hypotension vs autonomic dysfunction. Pacemaker 
was interrogated and did not show any major events. TTE also did 
not show any significant valvular disease; EF >55%.  Patient was 
orthostatic by vital signs and given IVF boluses. Her verapamil 
dose was reduced from 240mg BID to ___ daily.  She was 
monitored on telemetry without major events.  AM cortisol was 
low at 1.6 and thus diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency as cause 
of syncope was suggested.  However, this was likely spurious and 
due to the fentanyl she had received prior.  AM cortisol was 
repeated and returned normal at 17.  Patient was seen by 
physical therapy who recommended discharge to rehab.  She was 
counseled that she should no longer drive (PCP was contacted who 
stated that she had also advised her not to drive.)
  
# s/p MVA: Patient was restrained driver in car. Trauma films 
and CT imaging of her head, neck and torso did not show any 
acute injuries.  CT chest showed incidental findings of two 
3-4mm pulmonary nodules for which 12 month ___ chest CT 
was recommended.   
 
# COPD: She was continued on advair.  

# Essential tremor: She was continued on her primidone.  

Transitional Issues:
-CT chest showed incidental findings of two 3-4mm pulmonary 
nodules for which 12 month ___ chest CT was recommended.   

-Patient advised NOT to drive 
-Patient should follow up with her cardiologist to review blood 
pressure medication doses

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital.  You were 
admitted after a car accident during which you passed out.  Your 
blood pressure readings suggested that this may have been 
because you were dehydrated.  An ultrasound of your heart did 
not show major abnormalities.  CAT scans of your head/neck and 
torso and x-rays of chest and knee did not show any fractures or 
acute injuries.  You were seen by our physical therapist who 
recommended that you be discharged to a rehab facility to get 
more steady.  

Of note, your chest CT scan showed pulmonary nodules.  Please 
speak with your primary care doctor to have a ___ CT scan 
in 12 months to monitor for any changes in these nodules. 
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE DRIVING AS THIS CAN BE 
DANGEROUS NOT ONLY TO YOURSELF BUT TO OTHERS ON THE ROAD.

PTCA COMMENTS:     Diagnostic angiography revealed 80% proximal 
LAD 
stenosis followed by another diseased tubular segment with a 
maximal 
diameter stenosis of 80% involving the proximal and mid-LAD 
astride the 
origin of the first diagonal. We proceeded with PCI of these 
tandem 
lesions. The ___ Fr radial sheath was exchanged for a ___ Fr sheath. 

Bivalirudin was used for periprocedural anticoagulation. Patient 
also 
received 600 mg Clopidogrel at the beginning of the procedure. 
An XBLAD 
4.0 guide was used to engage the left coronary ostium and 
provided good 
support. A Prowater wire was used to cross the two lesions and 
placed in 
distal LAD. Both the lesions were predilated with a Sprinter RX 
2.0 x 25 
mm balloon at 10 atm and 12 atm (proximal). A 2.75 x 28 mm 
Promus DES 
was deployed across the lesion in proximal to mid-LAD across the 
origin 
of  the first diagonal at 14 atm. A 2.5 x 15 mm Promus DES was 
deployed 
across the lesion in proximal LAD at 16 atm. The stents were 
adequately 
overlapped. A NC Sprinter  2.75 x 21 mm balloon was used to 
post-dilate 
the stents at high pressures of ___ atm. Final angiograms 
showed 
excellent angiographic result with no residual stenosis, TIMI 3 
distal 
flow and no dissections or perforations. At the end of the 
procedure 
bivalirudin was discontinued and TR band applied to the right 
wrist for 
hemostasis. Patient tolerated the procedure without any 
complications 
and left the cath lab in a stable condition free of chest pain.

COMMENTS:      
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 
demonstrated severe single vessel CAD. The LMCA was a short 
vessel 
without any significant disease. The proximal LAD had a focal 
80% lesion 
after D1. There was an additional tubular 80% lesion in the mid 
LAD. The 
LCX had minimal disease throughout. The dominant RCA was a large 
caliber 
vessel with a 20% stenosis in the proximal segment, and no 
significant 
disease in the remainder of vessel. 
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic 
arterial 
pressures (129/66 with a mean of 93 mmHg). 
3) Left ventriculography was deferred. 
4) Successful angioplasty and stenting of the LAD lesions with 
overlapping 2.85 x 28mm and 2.5 x 15mm Promus DES. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Severe LAD disease. 
2. Successful angioplasty of the LAD lesions with overlapping 
2.75x28mm 
and 2.5x15mm Promus DES. 
3. Monitor patient overnight. 
4. Aspirin 325mg/day indefinitely. Plavix (clopidogrel) 75mg/day 
x 
minimum of 12 months.

=====================================================
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Impaired relaxation pattern. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo w/ PMHx s/f HTN, CLL, prostate cancer 
who presented with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion who ruled 
in for an NSTEMI.
.  
# CORONARIES: Mr. ___ ruled in or an NSTEMI with rising 
troponins in setting of chest pain, despite normal EKG. 
Troponins were drawn in the ED were positive to 0.05 at 11am on 
___, 0.11 at 5pm, and 0.03 at 11pm. He was begun on a heparin 
drip in the ED, and was maintained on this on the floor. The 
drip was turned off from 7am to 8am on ___ due to 
misinterpretation of cardiac enzymes. Cardiac catheterization 
was performed which demonstrated 2 80% stenoses in the proximal 
to mid LAD. Two overlapping DES were placed (PROMUS 2.85 x  28mm 
and 2.5 x 15mm).  During Mr. ___ hospitalization, 
nifedipine was discontinued, lisinopril was increased from 20 to 
40mg daily, and metoprolol was increased to 50mg XL daily to 
keep HR between 60-80 bpm.

# PUMP:  Given Mr. ___ dyspnea on exertion, CHF was a 
possible etiology. BNP was borderline high at 439. Echo was 
obtained on ___ which demonstrated normal systolic function, 
but impaired relaxation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. 
Chronic hypoventilation is likely cause of moderate pulmonary 
hypertension. 
.  
#  Hypertension: Home nifedipine was discontinued, and 
lisinopril was increased to 40mg to acheive optimal medical 
management. Terazosin was continued.
.  
#  GERD: Home omeprazole was continued.
.  
#  Anxiety: Pt recieved his nightly regimen of lorazepam and 
benadryl for insomnia. Bupropion was continued at 75mg BID as 
the extended release formulation was unavailable. Mr. ___ 
refused to take the outpatient abilify, and this was 
discontinued.

# ADHD: Methylphenidate was held in the context of an NSTEMI.
.  
#  Osteoporosis: Calcium citrate and vitamin D were continued. 
He will continue weekly alendronate therapy upon discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
   You were admitted after you had a myocardial infarction 
(heart attack). We diagnosed this based on blood tests, and your 
cardiac catheterization demonstrated a lesion in the proximal to 
mid left anterior descending artery - you received 2 
drug-eluting stents to this region. For these stents, you will 
need to take Plavix (clopidogrel) every day for at least ___ year 
- not taking Plavix could result in a heart attack or even 
death. Your echocardiogram showed relatively normal heart 
function, with some degree of impaired heart relaxation - this 
is reassuring. We have made the following changes to your 
medications:

1. START Atorvastatin 80mg daily (for at least 1 month) 
2. STOP Nifedipine
3. CHANGE Lisinopril 20mg daily to 40mg daily
4. START PLAVIX 75mg daily indefinitely
5. CHANGE ASPIRIN 81mg to 325mg daily
6. CHANGE Metoprolol from 25mg daily to 50mg daily
7. STOP methylphenidate 20mg TID
8. START Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily

rupture in any inflammatory condition, including ulcerative 
colitis. No fissures or transmural inflammation are seen. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was brought to the pre-operative area, evaluated by 
anesthesia, and taken to the OR on ___ and underwent a 
total abdominal colectomy and end ileostomy as the small bowel 
was unable to be brought down for J-pouch (please refer to 
operative note for complete detail). Patient tolerated to the 
procedure well and was brought to the PACU for a short recovery 
before being brought to the floor.  

Neuro: Post operatively the patient received an epidural with 
good effect and adequate pain control of operative sight but had 
reports of shoulder pain and was started on IV tylenol.  Patient 
continued to report pain and was started on toradol on POD 1 for 
a 3 day coarse with good effect.  On POD1 patient reported some 
right leg motor weakness when attempting to ambulate and 
epidural was turned down by the Acute Pain Service with 
improvement of function, with full restoration after epidural 
was discontinued.  On POD 2 when tolerating oral intake, the 
patient was transitioned to PO oxycodone and tylenol with good 
effect.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.  Patient 
reported shoulder pain post-operatively that radiated into his 
chest and an EKG was obtained which was sinus rhythm without 
evidence of ischemia, with a few PVCs.  Electrolytes were 
normal.  Pain was noted to be sharp in character and unrelated 
to exertion.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced to sips on POD1, and to full liquids 
on POD2, which was well tolerated.  Patient began to have stool 
and gas in ostomy and diet was advanced to POD2 to a regular 
diet.  Ostomy continued to put out gas and stool throughout this 
admission but was not putting out large volumes.  Patient was 
kept until POD 5 to continue ostomy teaching and to monitor 
ostomy output.  Patient's intake and output were closely 
monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when 
necessary.  Patient retained a foley with his epidural, and 
foley was discontinued on POD2 after epidural was pulled and 
patient voided without incident.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection, of which there were 
none.  The incision remained clean, dry, and intact throughout 
this admission. 

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding well, and pain was well controlled.  
The patient received discharge teaching and ___

Discharge Instructions:
___ were admitted to the inpatient general surgery unit. ___ 
have adequate pain control and have a tolerated a regular diet 
and may go home to continue your recovery.  

Please continue to monitor your ileostomy output. The most 
common complication from a new ileostomy placement is 
dehydration. The output from the stoma is stool from the small 
intestine and the water content is very high. The stool is no 
longer passing through the large intestine which is where the 
water from the stool is reabsorbed into the body and the stool 
becomes formed. ___ must measure your ileostomy output for the 
next few weeks. The output from the stoma should not be more 
than 1200 cc or less than 500 cc. If ___ find that your output 
has become too much or too little, please call the office for 
advice. The office nurse can recommend medications to increase 
or slow the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if 
___ notice your ileostomy output increasing, take in more 
electrolyte drink such as gatoraide. Please monitor yourself for 
signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dizziness 
(especially upon standing), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or 
fatigue. If ___ notice these symptoms please call the office or 
return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms 
are severe. ___ may eat a modified regular diet with your new 
ileostomy.  

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care 
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ stoma 
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be 
beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times 
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around 
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the 
skin around the stoma for buldging or signs of infection listed 
above. Please care for the ostomy as ___ have been instructed by 
the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ will be able to make an appointment 
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic. A visiting nurse ___ who 
will help ___ monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable 
caring for it on your own. ___ have a long vertical incision on 
your abdomen that is closed with staples. This incision can be 
left open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if 
the staples become irritated from clothing. The staples will 
stay in place until your first post-operative visit at which 
time they can be removed in the clinic, most likely by the 
office nurse. Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms 
of infection including: increasing redness at the incision, 
opening of the incision, increased pain at the incision line, 
draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if ___ 
develop a fever. 

Please call the office if ___ develop these symptoms or go to 
the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.  ___ may shower, 
let the warm water run over the incision line and pat the area 
dry with a towel, do not rub. 

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by your surgeon.  

___ will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication. 
___ may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take 
more than 4000 mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while 
taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the ___ cardiology service on ___ 
after you were found to have very fast heart rates, called 
atrial fibrillation which you have had in the past. 

What was done?
================
-You had a procedure called a cardioversion to convert this 
irregular rhythm to normal rhythm. Your heart rates responded 
well. You were still continued on the medication called 
amiodarone (400 mg every day) for your heart rates.

-You were followed by the kidney transplant team while you were 
here, and your immunosuppressants were continued. 

-While inpatient, he was switched from warfarin to apixiban 
(prior authorization completed), for ease of anticoagulation 
given prior subtherapeutic INRs.

What to do next?
================== 
-Please follow up with your doctors to ensure that you are on 
all the proper medications. You need to call your specialty 
pharmacy to ensure you refill your sirolimus and rapamycin. 

-You also have a follow up appointments as below, especially 
important is your Electrophysiology appointment on ___ 
___. 

-You were started on a new medication called Apixiban (eliquis) 
5 mg Twice a day. This will be the new blood thinner you take 
for your atrial fibrillation, and does not require blood level 
monitoring like warfarin. We stopped your warfarin. If you have 
any new bleeding, please inform your doctors.

History of Present Illness:
___ yo woman with H/O hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
prior diagnosis of mild aortic stenosis presenting with 2 hours 
of sharp left sided chest pain.

Patient was sitting in a chair earlier today when she developed 
sharp, sternal chest pain. This was not associated with 
diaphoresis, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, pain radiating 
down arm, or headache. The pain lasted 2 hours and improved 
after being given aspirin and nitroglycerin. She never had any 
pain like this in the past. She does note that she occasionally 
has some dizziness with standing, and her amlodipine had been 
decreased to 5 mg daily recently.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.0 HR 83 BP 142/63 RR 18 Sao2 
98% on RA. Labs significant for WBC 7.8, H/H 11.8/37.6, 
platelets 253, Na 132, K 8.5 hemolyzed (repeat 4.3), BUN 28, Cr 
1.1. Troponin-T 0.23. EKG in sinus rhythm, with LVH, and new T 
wave inversion in aVL. She was seen by cardiology in the ED, 
started on a heparin drip and admitted to the ___ 
Service. On arrival to the floor, T 99, BP 158/82, HR 70, RR 10, 
SaO2 100% on RA. ___ 302. Patient was lying comfortably in bed. 
She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or 
abdominal pain. She has felt well since before coming to the ED. 
Patient initially refused humalog as it was different than her 
normal 70/30. She eventually agreed to 2 Units of humalog.
 
Past Medical History:
-Hypertension

Interventional Details
  Using a ___ Fr XB 3.5 guide, the LCX lesion was crossed with a 
Prowater wire, dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon and stented with a 
2.5x24 Premier at 14 atm with no residual, normal flow. The RCA 
was then cannulated with a JR 4 guide. The distal lesion was 
crossed with a Prowater wire, dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon and 
stented with a 2.5x16 Premier at 14 atm with no residual, normal 
flow.  
Intra-procedural Complications: None
Impressions:
Successful DES of LCX and RCA
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with H/O hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
who presented with 2 hours of sharp left sided chest pain with 
elevated troponin indicative of an NSTEMI, now s/p drug eluting 
stents to the RCA and LCX.

NSTEMI: Patient presented with chest pain and elevated troponin. 
Peak CK-MB 17, peak troponin-T 0.37. Cardiac catheterization 
revealed LVEDP 12. LMCA was normal, LAD had diffuse 
irregularities with <50% proximal disease. LCx had a long 
segment of mid disease to 90%, RCA was diffusely calcified with 
<50% irregularities and a focal 90% lesion proximal to the 
distal bifurcation. Drug eluting stents were placed in the left 
circumflex and right coronary artery. Patient was chest pain 
free post procedure (radial access) without any complications. 
Echocardiogram identified mild symmetric LVH with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function, 
mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension

Her atorvastatin dose was increased to 80 mg for secondary 
prevention. Given ___, she was started on clopidogrel 
75 mg daily which she will need to continue for at least ___ year 
along with lifelong aspirin. Nebivolol was changed to metoprolol 
while inpatient but switched back on discharge. Nitroglycerin 
was prescribed in case of future symptoms. Physical therapy saw 
the patient after her procedure and recommended cardiac 
rehabilitation.

Orthostasis: During admission, she was also noted to be slightly 
orthostatic and was given gentle IV fluid hydration but 
orthostasis persisted. Lack of HR response was suggestive of 
autonomic dysfunction possibly due to longstanding diabetes 
mellitus. She was stable and chest pain free on discharge. She 
was cleared for discharge by physical therapy.

Asymptomatic Bactiuria: Of note, routine urine culture grew 
>100,000 E coli. However, the patient was completely 
asymptomatic and without pyuria so was not treated with 
antibiotics. Should she develop symptoms as an outpatient, she 
should be treated.

Transitional
1. Patient should follow up with her PCP ___ discharge. Her 
blood sugars were elevated during admission due to refussal of 
sliding scale humalog. A review of her regimen and blood sugar 
control would be beneficial. 
2. Patient was noted to be orthostatic during hospitalization 
unresponsive to fluids. Patient noted that the symptoms were 
chronic, possibly due to autonomic dysfunction from type 2 
diabetes mellitus. BP medictions continued in light of systolic 
BP up to 160 on full home regimen. Orthostatics should be 
checked as outpatient and regimen adjusted accordingly.
3. An appointment with cardiology has been made for ___. 
4. Asymptomatic bacteruria with >100,000 E coli. Not started on 
antibiotics while inpatient. Consider treatment if patient 
becomes symptomatic in the future. 
5. Atorvastatin increased to 80 mg for secondary prevention 
given multivessel eevere disease.
6. We recommend patient go to cardiac rehabilitation if language 
is not a barrier. 
7. Patient was given a script for SL nitroglycerin for angina.
8. Patient was started on clopidogrel 75 mg daily. She will need 
to continue this medication for at least ___ year post stent 
placement, along with 81 mg aspirin indefinitely. This was 
explained to the patient and her daughter with good 
understanding.

Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man, with history of squamous cell 
carcinoma presumably metastatic to the posterior fossa (s/p 
prophylactic VPS and XRT to mets), who presents today with 
headache and nausea.

Five weeks ago, the patient began having dizziness and mild 
LUE/LLE weakness.  After presenting to his PCP, he was sent to 
the ___ ER, where head imaging revealed three 
heterogeneously-enhancing parenchymal brain lesions, worrisome 
for metastatic disease. A further workup found lesions

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the posterior 
fossa (s/p prophylactic VPS and XRT to mets) who presents with 
worsening of a 3-week headache and acute onset of nausea.

# Headache/Nausea (resolved): 
When the patient initially presented with severe headache and 
nausea ___ morning, CT was obtained showing progression of 
disease within the brain (increase in both size and number of 
lesions). However, since the patient had undergone three WBRT 
treatments by this point, it was unclear whether the patient's 
symptoms were being caused by progression of metastatic disease 
vs. side effect from radiation (edema, possibly necrosis). The 
patient then resumed his whole brain radiation therapy, as well 
as being started on high-dose dexamethasone 6 mg IV every 6 
hours.  These steroids improved his symptoms dramatically - 
helping him ambulate with a walker, eat well, and lose his 
headache.  His blood glucose was monitored BID and remained in 
the low 100s. He will have ___ services to check his blood sugar 
every other day, and will be continued on pantoprazole given his 
steroid dose. Consideration of duration of therapy of steroids 
to be decided in follow-up. 

# Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma: 
According to a recent PET scan, the patient's SCC was seen to be 
metastatic to many locations in addition to the brain: the 
precarinal lymph node, bone, left adrenal gland, left hepatic 
lobe, supra and infratentorial locations, pelvic and 
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and left retropsoas mass. Given 
the extensive disease burden in the patient's body (outside the 
head), no therapeutics were given to offer local control.  For 
the disease in his head, however, it was decided the patient 
ought to continue his remaining 7 out of 10 WBRT doses, and be 
watched closely for radiation necrosis/edema by his radiation 
oncologist.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was our pleasure taking care of you here at ___.

You presented on ___ after waking up with a throbbing headache 
and severe nausea, unable to tolerate foods/medications by 
mouth. We adequately controlled your symptoms with pain and 
nausea medications (which you will be prescribed for home) and 
gave you high-dose steroids to reduce inflammation in your head. 
You finished your fourth dose of radiation yesterday, are 
scheduled for your fifth dose today, and will finish the rest of 
your ten doses as per schedule. As of this morning, on 
discharge, you are feeling no pain, nausea/vomiting, and are 
eating well. 

Please continue your Radiation Oncology appointments, as well as 
those listed below. It is very important that you take the 
steroids as listed, as well as the medication that protects your 
stomach (since you are on high-dose steroids). You will also 
have a visiting nurse to come by and check on your blood sugar.

If you feel weak, thirsty or are urinating more than normal, one 
consideration would be that your blood sugar is elevated. You 
should have this checked, either at home or Dr. ___. 
Please contact Dr. ___ office with any concerns as well. 


We wish you all the best!

was intubated for airway protection.  He was also noted to be 
hypotensive, requiring Levophed.  He received Keppra, cefepime, 
Vanco, and received IVF (""a few boluses""). He was planned for 
transfer to ___ given medical complexity.  However given 
delayed timing in the ED, he was admitted briefly to ___ 
ICU.  In the ICU he had right IJ CVL placed, femoral arterial 
line placed, and was paralyzed with cisatracurium for

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ y.o. male with PMH of HCV cirrhosis 
SVR s/p Solvadi (___), previously c/b Grade II-III varices s/p 
TIPS (___), HTN who presents after being found down with 
shock, AMS requiring intubation, and ARF, found to be in 
refractory convulsive status epiliepticus possibly due to 
infective encephalitis. MRI eventually revealed diffuse anoxic 
brain injury with poor prognosis for recovery. In light of this, 
his HCP and family elected to transition him to ___ focused 
care. He terminally extubated and died peacefully ___ 01:34 
with family at his bedside. 

For posterity, his hospital course is as follows:

# Encephalopathy:
# Refractory convulsive status epilepticus: 
# Suspected meningitis vs encephalitis
Likely multifactorial with contributions from seizures, 
toxic/metabolic (uremia, HE), infection, possible hypoxemic 
injury. Seizures suppressed on Keppra, VPA, midazolam, Propofol; 
this was changed to keppra, lacosamide (VPA d/c'd given hepatic 
clearance).  Propofol discontinued. Midazolam slowly weaned. 
Treated TME with aggressive lactulose w/rifaximin, although 
lactulose discontinued in setting of lower GIB as below. 
Maintained on vanc / cefepime / ampicillin / acyclovir at 
meningitic dosing. LP not performed due to coagulopathy.

# Shock / Lactic Acidosis: There was concern for septic, most 
likely of CNS origin given substrate and CSE. Empiric Cefepime, 
Vanc, Ampicillin, & Acyclovir all renally-adjusted for suspected 
meningitis vs encephalitis. Was also on doxycycline from 
___ but discontinued once lyme felt to be less likely. 
CDiff neg. Urine cx +ve for enterococcus.  No ascites to tap as 
of u/s ___. He was briefly on norepinephrine and vasopressin 
but was able to be weaned.  Received thiamine 500mg IV Q8H x 2 
days then 250mg IV QD x 5 days for lactic acidosis. 

# Non-Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: felt to be due to sepsis and 
prerenal etiology vs ATN. Resolved with fluids and improved 
perfusion.

# Acute Respiratory Failure: Intubated initially for airway 
protection in setting of encephalopathy. P:F > 200, likely due 
to encephalopathy c/b aspiration. He was placed on low tidal 
volume ventilation and required paralysis for vent compliance; 
paralytics discontinued ___. He was terminally extubated 
___

# Coagulopathy: likely due to cirrhosis; received IV Vit K x 3 
days and FFP PRN INR > 1.5 for procedures. RUQUS showed patent 
TIPS flow and no other acute changes.

# Acute blood loss anemia: Bright red blood per rectum on ___ 
in flexiseal. s/p 2u FFP, DDAVP, and 1u Platelets. Gastric 
lavage ___ without e/o UGIB. GI consulted, likely LGIB from 
rectal ulcer w flexiseal. He was placed on octreotide gtt and IV 
PPI BID although UGIB felt to be less likely 

HCP: ___ (wife/HCP) ___

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o F with HTN and asthma who presented to ___ 
with left-sided chest pain. She reports that, while skiing 
approximately one month ago, she had the sudden onsent of 
significant left-sided chest pain, which self-resolved. Upon 
returning home, she saw her PCP, had ___ normal ECG, and was told 
that this was likely MSK pain. Since then, she been experiencing 
intermittent episodes of chest pain over the past month, 
generally occuring at rest. Over the past few weeks, she has 
also had some cough and heavy breathing, which was being treated 
as an asthma flare with albuterol, theophylline, and prednisone. 
This morning, she again developed sudden-onset left-sided chest 
pain, this time associated with palpitations. The pain persisted 
for several hours, ultimately prompting her to come to the ED 
for evaluation. She describes the pain as an ""ache"" located in 
the left chest, non-radiating. No associated SOB or diaphoresis, 
but she did have some mild nausea this morning.
.
She initially presented to an OSH ED. EKG was concerning for ST 
depression in the inferior leads with an elevated troponin of 
6.2. She was given Aspirin 325mg, Plavix 300mg, Metoprolol 
12.5mg, started on Heparin gtt. She continued to have 
intermittent pain at OSH and was transferred to ___ for 
further management. During transportation to ___, she had 
recurrence of chest pain and was given SL Nitro x3 with minimal 
relief.
. 
In the ED, initial vitals were: 96.8 70 ___ 97% 2L. 
Cardiology was consulted and recommended starting Nitro gtt for 
recurrent chest pain, which was not started initially due to 
hypotension 85/56 following Morphine IV. The patient received 
IVF with improvement of BP to 95/80, 113/70. A bedside echo 
showed no evidence of pericardial effusion. A repeat EKG on 
presentation to the ___ showed q waves in III, ?ST depressions 
in V5-6 while the patient was experiencing ___ chest pain. CXR 
showed no acute cardiopulmonary process. Given ongoing chest 
pain, she was started on a nitro gtt; however her BP dropped to 
86/42 and the nitro gtt was stopped. She was free of chest pain 
at the time of transfer to the floor.
. 
On arrival to the floor, the patient's VS were T=98.4 BP=113/45 
HR=53 RR=16 O2 sat=100/2L. She reported that she was continuing 
to have brief intermittent episodes of mild chest pain. She 
denied any current chest pain; however. She denied any other 
complaints.
. 
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or 
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the 
other review of systems were negative.

___ CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
___ ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with focal distal septal/apical hypokinesis. No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the

leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion.
.
___ Cardiac MRI:
1. Normal left ventricular cavity size. Hypokinesis of the mid 
and distal septum and the apex with preserved systolic function. 
The LVEF was normal at 60%. The effective forward LVEF was 
normal at 61%. CMR evidence of recent myocardial 
scarring/infarction with increased T2 signal and transmural late 
gadolinium enhancement of the mid and distal septum and the 
apex.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 
The RVEF was normal at 67%.  
.
PROCEDURES:
___ Left Heart Cath: 
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system 
demonstrated no obstructive coronary artery disease. The LMCA 
was normal. The LAD had long 30% lesion from the mid to distal 
portion of the vessel. The LCx and RCx were normal.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated hight normal left 
sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 13mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated normal ejection fraction 
of 60% with no apparent mitral regurgitation.  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No significant coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with HTN and asthma transferred from an OSH 
for chest pain, ST depressions, and elevated troponin consistent 
with NSTEMI.
.
# Chest pain: Patient presented with chest pain, elevated 
troponin, and STE in V2 and TWI in V3, V4 concerning for an LAD 
lesion. The patient was continued on a heparin gtt, ASA, and 
Plavix. ECHO revealed mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with focal distal septal/apical hypokinesis, 
concerning for infarct. Cardiac catheterization revealed a 30% 
distal LAD lesion, however no obstructive lesions. It was 
unclear whether this was a resolved thrombis vs myocarditis, 
therefore cardiac MRI was obtained which showed evidence of 
recent myocardial scarring/infarction with increased T2 signal 
and transmural late gadolinium enhancement of the mid and distal 
septum and the apex. Therefore, her chest pain was felt to be 
due to an NSTEMI with resolved thrombus. The patient was 
discharged on aspirin 325mg, Plavix 75mg, atorvastatin 80mg, 
metoprolol 12.5mg, and SL nitroglycerin prn. She has outpatient 
cardiology follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain and were found 
to have a heart attack. You had a cardiac catheterization which 
showed that your coronary arteries did not have any clots, so we 
did not place any stents. It is likely that the clot resolved 
with the anticoagulation prior to the catheterization. You may 
continue to have intermittent chest discomfort.  
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
- STARTED aspirin 325mg daily
- STARTED Plavix (clopidogrel) 75mg daily
- STARTED Lipitor (atorvastatin) 80mg daily
- STARTED metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg daily
- STARTED nitroglycern 0.4mg sublingual as needed for chest pain
- STOPPED theophylline
- STOPPED prednisone
.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you continue to take your aspirin and 
Plavix daily unless specifically instructed to stop by your 
cardiologist.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 50-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. She has a history of hypertension and asthma. She initially presented to an outside hospital with chest pain and was given aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol, but her pain persisted. She was transferred to the current hospital for further management. In the emergency department, she was found to have ST depression on her EKG and an elevated troponin level. She was started on a nitroglycerin drip, but her blood pressure dropped, and the drip was stopped. She was transferred to the floor, where she continued to experience intermittent episodes of mild chest pain.

The patient's diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the report, but it appears that she may have had a myocardial infarction or recent myocardial scarring/infarction based on the cardiac MRI findings. She underwent a left heart catheterization, which showed no obstructive coronary disease.

The patient was prescribed the following medications at discharge: aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and nitroglycerin. She has an allergy to erythromycin base.

The patient's physical examination was normal, with no abnormalities noted in her cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal systems. Her laboratory results showed elevated troponin and CK-MB levels, but her cardiac enzymes returned to normal levels over time. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
#Brain Lesion
Ms. ___ presented to the emergency department as a 
transfer from outside hospital, with a head CT notable for large 
area of hypodensity suggestive of vasogenic edema causing mass 
effect and shift of midline structures. She was admitted to the 
___ for treatment and surgical planning. She was started on 
dexamethasone and keppra. MRI was performed which demonstrated 
5.2 x 4.5 x 4.6 cm heterogeneously enhancing right 
temporoparietal mass, with moderate surrounding vasogenic edema 
and mass effect with 12 mm leftward midline shift and uncal 
herniation. Patient was taken to the OR on ___ for right 
craniotomy tumor resection. She tolerated the procedure well. 
Please see formal op report in OMR for further intra-operative 
details. She was transferred to the PACU post operatively where 
she remained stable and was later transferred to the floor. MRI 
was done on POD1 and showed normal post operative changes. On 
___ patient was noted to have anisicoria R>L, which was not 
noted the day prior. Her exam was otherwise stable. A NCHCT was 
obtained and showed no acute hemorrhages, and stable post op 
changes. Patient exam remained stable and she was changed to 
floor status.

#HTN
Patient had sustained hypertension post operatively requiring 
nicardipine drip. She was later weaned off the nicardipine drip 
and blood pressure was managed with prn hydral. Patient 
continued to require prn hydral daily for systolic blood 
pressures greater than 160. Therefore she was started on 
amlodipine 5mg daily. 

#Elevated INR & Low platelets 
Patient was noted to have uptrending INR. She received vitamin K 
prior to surgery with adequate response. INR downtrended and 
continued to be monitored closely and remained stable for 
remainder of admission. 

#Anxiety/Paranoia 
Patient had high anxiety during her admission with paranoia, 
stating she felt like the room was closing in on  her. Patient 
has history of anxiety, yet this was likely exacerbated by high 
doses of steroids. Patient steroid taper was accelerated to over 
1 week. She was written for her home Xanax prn and psychiatry 
was consulted for further management. Patient was stating that 
she wants to leave AMA. Psych evaluated the patient and patient 
agreed to stay until rehab placement. 

At the time of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating without difficulty, afebrile with stable vital signs.

well up until one month prior to presentation on ___ when he 
developed headaches and abdominal pain refractory to 
peptobismol. On ___ he came to outpatient GI with headaches, 
abdominal pain, nausea and confusion. His cirrhosis was 
compensated prior to this visit. Labs at clinic showed elevated 
AST/ALT/INR/Cr 1->1.8 so he was admitted for worsening hepatic 
failure with encephalopathy.

On the floor, US was negative for PV thrombosis, CT showed known 
cirrhosis and liver lesion without biliary or ductal or 
pathology. He was given ceftriaxone and flagyl as well as 
lactulose for HE. Transaminitis, coagulopathy and mental status 
worsened and a rapid response was called on morning of ___ for 
FSBG 29. Glucagon and juice brought sugar up to 150s. He was 
given IM haldol, placed in 4pt restraints and was transferred to

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with HBV/HCV cirrhosis, previously Child A with low 
MELD. On entecavir with negative VL being transferred to ___ 
for fulminant liver failure now with worsening coagulopathy and 
bleeding.

# Fulminant Liver Failure: MELD of 48 (based on INR 16, Bili 3.0 
Cr 2.0). Intial decompensation likey due to hepatitis B flare, 
with subsequent multiorgan failure likely due to sepsis. Blood 
cultures never confirmed bacteremia, but the patient was treated 
empirically w/ vanc/zosyn/levo. The patient was transferred from 
___ to liver transplant evaluation. Evaluation was begun, but 
the patient's clinical status never improved to the point where 
transplantation would have been feasible. With increasing 
pressor requirements and multiorgan failure, a family meeting 
was held and it was decided to transition the patient to CMO. 
Paralysis was discontinued and his pressors were turned off. The 
patient expired rapidly with family, son and daughter, at 
bedside.

# Shock: Likely hypovolemic from blood loss. NG lavage was 
bloody. Hb dropped to 5.2. Transfused 2 units, bumpted to 6, 
transfused 2 additional units.  Treated empirically w/ 
vanc/zosyn/levo. On levophed. CT abd/pelvis neg for source of 
infection or overt bleeding. Vasopressin was added on ___.

# Respiratory Failure: Intubated in setting of agitation and 
AMS. Course complicated by hemoptysis and bloody mucous plug 
obstructing right main stem and ETT resulting in PIPs to ___, 
now s/p 3 bronchoscopies w/ plug removal and PIP decreased to 
___. Got paralysis overnight for vent synchrony in setting of 
PIPs ___ w/ plateau 28. Esophageal balloon showed acceptable 
transpulmonary pressures. Paralysis was continued until just 
before the patient expired.

# Anuric renal failure - Likely secondary to hypovolemia from 
shock. Cr 2 at ___, unknown baseline. Developed oliguria 
overnight on ___. Pt was empirically treated for HRS w/ 
albumin, midodrine and octreotide, without improvement. 

# Coagulopathy/Anemia - Likely secondary to fulminant liver 
failure with ?component of DIC. S/p 2U pRBCs AM of ___, also 8U 
FFP and 3 platelets. Blood loss likely secondary to hemoptysis, 
oozing from lines. Possible GI source, though EGD ___ without 
varices or ulcer.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the general surgery service after 
presenting with complaint of epigastric and RUQ pain x several 
weeks. His initial labwork was notable for a leukocytosis of 
11.5, lipase of 129, TBR 1.1, and mild transaminitis. He 
underwent RUQ ultrasound which demonstrated gallbladder sludge 
but no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. At this 
point, he was admitted to the medicine service due to concern 
for pancreatitis or potential choledocholithiasis given his lab 
abnormalites. He was started on bowel rest, IVF hydration, and 
IV ciprofloxacin/flagyl therapy. On HD2, he subsequently 
underwent MRCP which demonstrated mild pancreatitis, CBD 
dilation to 1.1cm, and gallbladder wall thickening concerning 
for acute cholecystitis.  He was transferred to the surgical 
service on HD2 in anticipation of cholecystectomy given these 
findings of cholecystitis in the absence of choledocholithiasis. 
At this point, his lipase had returned to normal and his 
abdominal pain had largely resolved. He was taken to the 
operating room on HD3 for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which 
was uncomplicated and tolerated well. He did well 
post-operatively. His diet was gradually advanced from clears to 
regular, which he tolerated well. He voided appropriately and 
ambulated. His pain was well controlled on an oral regimen prior 
to discharge home. He is being discharged home on POD1 in stable 
condition to follow up in general surgery clinic in ___ weeks. 

Also of note, the patient complained of some pain in his right 
great toe, likely secondary to gout. He was continued on his 
home allopurinol and started on colchicine as needed, with 
improvement in his symptoms.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
You were admitted to the general surgery service for treatment 
of your gallbladder infection. You were taken to the operating 
room for removal of your gallbladder, which you tolerated well. 
You did well post-operatively and are being discharged home in 
stable condition. You should follow up in general surgery clinic 
in one to two weeks. 
 
Please follow the post-operative directions below:

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

DIET:
You may have a regular diet as tolerated without restrictions. 

YOUR BOWELS:
-It is common to have some diarrhea after having your 
gallbladder removed. This should improve on it's own gradually. 
You can use immodium as needed if you have significant diarrhea 
until you are seen in clinic in ___ weeks. 
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace) or gentle laxative (such as senna or miralax) 
twice a day. You can get any of these medicines without a 
prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for 
pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to exceed 
3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after surgery 
but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses if you 
are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may take 
the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled by the 
Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics to 
help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly wean 
off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)
-any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
- dressing removal: Remove the outer dressing 48 hours after 
your surgery.
-You may shower starting tonight. Once you remove your outer 
dressing tomorrow, you can continue to shower with any bandage 
strips that may be covering your wound. Do not scrub and do not 
soak or swim, and pat the incision dry. If you have steri 
strips, they will fall off by themselves in ___ weeks. If any 
are still on in two weeks and the edges are curling up, you may 
carefully peel them off.  
-Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a patient known to cardiac surgery service that 
was seen in ___ after MI for surgical evaluation. She 
completed her workup and was admitted on ___ for Heparin 
bridging (Afib) prior to surgery.  She was taken to the 
operating room on ___ and underwent coronary artery 
bypass grafting see op note for full details. In summary she 
had: Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with
left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, 
reverse saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery, 
diagonal branch, marginal branch. Her bypass time was 77 minutes 
with a crossclamp time of 62 minutes.
She tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. She remained hemodynamically stable and 
later that day weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact 
and was extubated.  On POD1 she was weaned from vasopressor 
support, Beta blocker was initiated and she was diuresed toward 
her preoperative weight.  Additionally she was transferred to 
the telemetry floor for further recovery. All chest tubes, and 
lines were discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without 
complication. Coumadin was resumed for history of paroxysmal 
AFib.  She developed rapid AFib on POD 2 and converted to SR 
with Amiodarone and titration of beta blockade.  Once on the 
floor she worked with nursing and physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility. Her INR became 
supratherapeutic  and coumadin had to be held before pacing 
wires could be removed. They were finally removed on POD 9.  She

___ CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:      
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 
two 
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had minimal disease 
with modest 
calcification. The LAD had moderate-severe diffuse disease in 
the 
mid-segment. There were serial 80% lesions in the LAD at the 
bifurcation 
with the D1. The D1 was a large bifurcating vessel with a 
proximal 80% 
lesion. There were left-right collaterals noted. The LCx was a 
non-dominant vessel without critical lesions. The RCA was a 
dominant 
vessel with origin 20% calcified lesion and mid-segment 90% 
lesion. There was mild distal RCA disease. 
2. There was normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP 120 mmHg 
and DBP 
64 bpm. 
3. Successful stenting of the mid-RCA with 3.0 X 28 mm Cypher 
___ 
___ to 3.25 mm with no residual stenosis (see PTCA 
comments for 
detail). 
4. No demonstrable critical ostial RCA disease as documented by 
MLD on 
IVUS. 
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with Cypher DES. 
.
___ Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There 
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the aortic regurgitation is reduced; other 
findings are similar.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with a PMH of HTN, 
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia who presents with an 
inferior STEMI. 
.  
#. CAD: The patient presented with chest pain and was found to 
have an inferior STEMI on EKG. The patient was taken emergently 
for cardiac catheterization on ___, during which time a ___ 
___ was placed in the RCA to a mid-segment 90% lesion. 
Moderately severe diffuse disease was noted in the mid-segment 
of the LAD and at the bifurcation of D1;this was poorly suitable 
for PCI because of the very diffuse and bifurcation disease. The 
patient tolerated cardiac cath very well, with no recurrence of 
chest pain during her hospital course. Peak CK was in the 170s, 
EKG changes were resolving post-cath. ___ Echo showed no 
evidence of systolic dysfunction or WMA. The patient was 
monitored on telemetry with no significant events. She was 
continued on pravastatin 80mg daily, ASA 325mg, and a BB. Plavix 
was started for duration of at least 12months. ACEI was not 
added given that there was no evidence of any systolic 
dysfunction on echo. The patient was advised that she would need 
additional stress testing in ___ weeks to further evaluate 
cardiac status. Given diffuse disease, she may be a candidate 
for CABG in the future.
.
#. Pump: The patient had mild diastolic dysfunction on ___ echo 
in setting of post-MI. There was no systolic dysfunction or wall 
motion abnormality seen on echo. She was discharged on decreased 
dose of lasix (20mg daily), which was initially started for 
history ___ swelling by her PCP. 
.  
#. Rhythm: The patient was in NSR with no acute issues. She was 
continued on metoprolol while inhouse, and was discharged on 
home dose of atenolol upon discharge.
.  
#. Borderline diabetes: The patient had HbA1c of 5.8% with good 
glycemic control with diet-modification. 
.
#. Chronic pain/fibromyalgia: The patient was continued on 
dilaudid prn.
.  
#. RLE pain: The patient was continued on home dose of

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 64-year-old female who presented with an inferior STEMI. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis, chronic pain syndrome, depression, and bilateral cataracts. She has a family history of premature coronary artery disease in her father, who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. 

The patient's allergies include penicillins and ibuprofen. She was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of chest pain and was found to have an 80% stenosis at the bifurcation of the LAD and OM, which was too difficult to stent due to concern for jailing the artery. She also had a 90% lesion to the mid RCA, which was stented with a DES. 

The patient's medications at discharge include ASA, morphine, lopressor, heparin, plavix, and integrallin. Her physical examination was normal, with no signs of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Her laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated troponin and creatine kinase levels. 

The patient's diagnosis is two-vessel coronary artery disease, with successful stenting of the mid-RCA with a Cypher DES. Her echocardiogram showed normal left atrial size, left ventricular wall thickness, and regional/global systolic function, with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the plastic surgery service on 
___ and a surgical repair of a subcostal hernia with mesh.  
The patient tolerated the procedure well. Overnight, patient 
noted left eye pain, injection and periorbital redness.  
Artificial tears were given for comfort and an Ophthalmology 
consult was obtained.  A left corneal abrasion was diagnosed and 
patient was commenced on erythromycin ointment, artificial 
tears, and a left eye patch was applied for comfort.  On POD#2, 
patient developed nausea and abdominal distention and 
discomfort.  She was made NPO and started on IV fluids.  Patient 
was given antiemetics and a KUB was obtained.  Patient was noted 
be tachycardic to 120's and oxygen saturations were 91-94% yet 
denied feeling shortness of breath or chest pain.  EKG was 
normal. Labs revealed WBC count of 17.7.  Patient was sent for a 
V/Q scan which revealed low probability of pulmonary embolism.  
A CT of the abdomen, without IV contrast due to allergy, 
revealed concern for pneumatosis of the cecum, but with no 
clinical correlation to symptoms and is likely a benign finding. 
The patient was switched from oral to IV metoprolol and her 
tachycardia improved. She was encouraged to use her incentive 
spirometer and her O2sats improved. On POD#4, the patient was 
tolerating a regular diet, her pain was well controlled, and she 
was transitioned back to her home dose of PO metoprolol. 
.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received IV pain medication 
with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral 
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. 
.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. His/Her diet was advanced when 
appropriate, which was tolerated well. She was also started on a 
bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on 
POD#2. Intake and output were closely monitored. 
MRI revealed a L renal cyst that should be evaluated again by 
MRI in the outpatient setting to monitor for increase in size. 
.
ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV cefazolin. 
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of 
infection. 
.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. 
.
At the time of discharge on POD#4, the patient was doing well, 
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.

History of Present Illness:
___ with ESRD on HD, HLD, HTN, DM, lifetime smoking who
presents with persistent dysarthria. She was in her usual state
of health until yesterday morning. Sometime after waking, her
family noticed that she was slurring her speech (they assume she
woke up that way). This is unusual for her. She seemed more 
tired
than normal and her blood glucose was elevated into the ~200s.
They completed their daily activities. When they came back in

fatigue, she had no associated vision changes, weakness, sensory
changes, vertigo, changes in gait. She has never been worked up
for stroke. She thinks that she has slurred her speech in the
past but she can't provide any details and her family is unaware
of this. In ___, she had a brief episode of
non-responsiveness during dialysis. EEG showed generalized as
well as bitemporal delta and MRI was very poor secondary to
motion artifact. She tells me today that she is unwilling to
undergo another MRI at this time. Neurology was consulted for
workup and management recommendations.

echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function 
(LVEF>60%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the stroke service given mild 
dysarthria. This improved during admission. Given defibrillator, 
MRI was not obtained for further analysis of a possible infarct, 
and CT did not reveal evidence of acute infarct. CTA was notable 
for intracranial atherosclerosis affecting in the intracranial 
ICA and narrowing of the posterior circulation. 

During admission, new HD catheter was placed by ___ as her 
fistula was not functioning and she underwent dialysis without 
complication on ___ and ___. 

Echocardiogram with normal EF and no evidence of intracardiac 
thrombus. She was monitored on telemetry without evidence of 
arrhythmia. 

A1C 7.9 with known DM. LDL 58 on home atorvastatin 80mg. She was 
taking ASA 81mg upon admission that was changed to Plavix 75mg 
for secondary stroke prevention. 

On the CTA, there was a noted goiter and pulmonary lung nodule. 
TSH normal, and thyroid US should be conducted as outpatient. 
Additionally, dedicated chest CT should be obtained as 
outpatient to evaluate new lung nodule. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. Stop ASA81mg and start Plavix 75mg daily. 
2. Obtain Chest CT to evaluate pulmonary nodule and thyroid US 
to evaluate goiter as outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
  
 
Dear Ms. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of difficulty speaking 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- Stop taking aspirin and start Plavix 75mg daily. 
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.  

 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted for cardiac surgical intervention due to worsening dyspnea on exertion and angina. He has a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes mellitus. His past medical history also includes dyslipidemia, obesity, sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, psoriasis, anxiety/depression, hearing loss, osteoarthritis, and bilateral great toe neuropathy. He has allergies to penicillins.

The patient underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23mm St. Jude Medical Biocor Epic tissue valve. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU for recovery and invasive monitoring. He was extubated on post-operative day 1 and was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable. He was treated for a large amount of bloody chest tube output and a drop in hematocrit, and was eventually discharged to home with follow-up instructions.

At discharge, the patient was prescribed medications including Pepcid, Fish Oil, rosuvastatin, lisinopril, Norvasc, metformin, glipizide, acetaminophen, hydromorphone, aspirin, clopidogrel, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, furosemide, potassium chloride, and Lopressor. ||endoftext||"

Imaging:
___: CT C/A/P: Air-fluid collection centered in splenic 
hilum near an apparent site of gastrojejunostomy  

___: CT Head: Left parieto-occipital vasogenic edema with 
the suggestion of a central lesion within that area.  

___: MR Head: Rim-enhancing left parietal lesion with 
surrounding edema with enhancement of the adjacent leptomeninges 
and pachymeninges with subdural collection in the left 
frontoparietal region measuring approximately 5 mm. Suspicious 
for an abscess with a  
question of subdural empyema. No midline shift is seen. Mild 
mass effect on the left lateral ventricle  

___: CXR no infiltrates, line OK, no PTX  

___: TTE no vegetations, EF 50%, trivial MR. ___.  

___: CT Interval increase size of L prefrontal subdural 
collection, 1.6 x 5.6 cm in widest ___. Unchanged L 
posterior frontal cerebral abscess 1.6 x 0.7 cm. Mass effect 
from left prefrontal subdural empyema w/4 mm rightward deviation 
of falx.  

___: The small air-fluid collection at splenic hilum, 
slightly  
decreased in size. Still tracks through spleen an unusual 
wedge-shaped configuration to subcapsular region associated  
with small pleural effusion and LLL atelectasis. ? cause of  
collection. Wedge-shaped low-attenuation abnormalities in 
periphery of spleen could represent prior infarcts. Collection 
would be difficult to access percutaneously, probably  
require trans-splenic approach. New RLL centrilobular nodules w/ 
___ configuration and atelectasis suggests recent 
infection or inflammation d/t ?aspiration. L adnexal ovoid 
homogeneous cystic abnormality f/u by U/s.  

___: CXR NG tip in stomach. RIJ tip at cavoatrial junction. 
There LLL volume loss and RLL volume loss w/obscuration of 
hemidiaphragms. ?underlying infectious infiltrate.  

___: CXR L PIC catheter terminates in the lower superior vena 
cava.  

___: CT new hypodense lesion w/hyperdense rim L frontal 
region,highly suspicious for evolving abscess vs. postop change. 
Interval increase in L centrum semiovale edema, w/ 2mm shift of 
midline structures.  

___: MRI prelim no interval change in dominant ring-enhancing 
intraparenchymal fluid collection in L parietal lobe and 
associated subdural fluid, slightly increased parenchymal edema 
w mass effect and meningial enhancement  

___ Sinus CT: Heterogeneous opacification of multiple 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells and right middle ear 
cavity,with no evidence of bony erosions. ___ sinusitis or h/o 
intubation.  

___: TEE
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetation or abscess seen

___: EEG: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations 
but it 
did capture several events of rhythmic activity seen 
predominantly in 
the right frontal area and suggestive, although not clearly so, 
of a 
seizure activity. There were no clear interictal spikes seen in 
this 
recording. The background activity was slow suggestive of a 
moderate 
encephalopathy with slower frequencies seen in the left 
posterior 
quadrant suggestive of functional and probably structural 
abnormality in 
that area. 

___ Lower Extremity U/S:
IMPRESSION: Occlusive thrombus from the proximal right SFV to at 
least the 
level of the popliteal vein.  

___ CT Ab/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No change in size of perisplenic fluid collection. A small 
amount of oral contrast and air tracking from anastomotic site 
to splenic hilum is most compatible with contained leak, 
unchanged since prior examination from ___. 
2. Asymmetric enlargement with hypodensity in the right versus 
left femoral veins that could indicate right venous thrombus. 
Recommend correlation with ultrasound. 
3. Stable appearance of left adnexal cystic lesion since 
earliest available examination of ___. Recommend pelvic 
ultrasound be performed within six weeks in outpatient setting 
or when clinically feasible for further evaluation. 
4. Slight decrease in size of right obturator internus muscle 
with 15-mm area of hyperdensity suggestive of calcification. 
This is likely related to resolving hematoma or myositis 
ossificans. No fluid collection in this area to suggest abscess 
formation. 
5. Transverse colonic Richter hernia with no evidence of 
obstruction. 

___ Head MRI:
Interval resolution of previously seen abscess cavities. A small 
amount of 
enhancement in the left parietal lobe is noted which has 
decreased 
considerably compared to the prior examination. Previously noted 
subdural 
collections have resolved. There is decreased mass effect. 

Microbiology:
MRSA screen: positive

Blood Cultures:
___ Negative

Urine Cultures: Negative

Abscess Culture ___:
Strep species x 2
Wound swab- strep milleri
Repeat Wound Cultures: Negative

HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final ___: 
      NEGATIVE BY EIA. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ YO F with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p BMT (___), 
Aortic valve replacement (biological), atrial fibrillation not 
previously on coumadin, prior report of cardiomyopathy (EF 45%) 
who was transferred to ___ on ___ for management of left 
parietal mass found to have a parietal Strep ___ abscess c/b 
subdural empyema s/p craniotomy with evacuation.

1. Brain Abscesses (Seizures): The patient initially presented 
to an OSH on ___ after nearly a week of left frontal headaches, 
right sided arm and leg weakness and progressive aphasia. At the 
OSH neuroimaging revealed a ring enhancing left parietal mass 
with extensive surrounding edema.  On ___ morning rounds, 
patient was witnessed to have ongoing seizures characterized 
with right arm tremor despite Keppra loading.  Respiratory 
status was marginal with acute tachypnea and so she was 
transferred to the ICU at this time. MRI read came back 
indicating a intracranial abscess with a subdural empyema.  The 
patient was taken emergently to the OR for drainage.  She was 
left intubated post operatively and maintained on a midazolam 
gtt, which was slowly weaned and the patient was transitioned to 
Keppra and dilantin. An MRI from ___ showed interval decrease 
in size of the left parietal abscess status post surgical 
evacuation. There was also a small new multiloculated subdural 
collection in the left parieto-occipital region which worsened 
and repeat craniotomy was performed on ___.  She has been 
without seizure activity since ___.  Her motor exam improved 
slightly in UE and significantly in ___ on the Right. 

On transfer to the internal medicine service, the patient left 
sided strength continued to improve.  She is to continue 
Pencillin, Cipro and Flagyl for at least 3 more weeks as 
directed by Infectious disease.  Her recent repeat head MRI 
showed significant interval improvement.  The patient has 
Neurology & Neurosurgical follow-up in the next several weeks 
with a repeat MRI scheduled.  She will continue on Keppra, 
Phenytoin taper and Divalproex with levels followed by 
Neurology.

The patient continues to have head pain which is currently 
controlled on a Fentanyl Patch and Dilaudid PO prn.  It is 
expected that her need for these medicines will diminish over 
the coming weeks.

2. Anastamotic Leak/Splenic Abscess: Patient was noted to have 
multiple abscesses on head imaging.  Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV 
Q12H, MetRONIDAZOLE 500 mg IV Q8H and Fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H 
were started empirically as was vancomycin.  The cultures from 
burhole surgical site on ___ grew STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS 
(___) for which she was desensitized and started on 
Penicillin G on ___, vancomycin was discontinued as was 
fluconazole.  She has remained afebrile since ___.  She 
underwent infectious work up which revealed negative UCx, CXR, 
___ TEE showed no vegetations.  Her CT abdomen showed a 
small air-fluid collection at the splenic hilum, tracking 
through the spleen in a wedge-shaped configuration, w/ small 
pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis as well as a 
possible ulceration at the old roux en y site. She was also 
noted to have opacities in her sinuses (maxillary, sphenoid, but 
not frontal). It was felt that the source for the infection was 
either splenic abscess, a possible ulceration vs. extension from 
the sinuses (unlikely based on ENT evaluation).  Given difficult 
approach, it was felt that she could not undergo drainage by ___. 
 The obturator abscess was ruled a hematoma and the splenic 
abscess was ruled a remant of the leak.  The patient will 
continue Cipro/Flagyl for 3 more weeks under the guidance of 
Infectious Disease.

Surgery was consulted for a thorough evaluation of her 
anastamotic leak.  After a period of NPO with repeat studies by 
CT and X-ray, as well as consultation with bariatric surgery, it 
was decided that this leak was likely chronic, and although 
possibly the source of the abscesses, did not pose an active 
risk with regards to nutrition.  The patient was maintained on 
TPN while this was under evaluation, but ultimately was able to 
be discharged on a regular diet without issue. 

3. R Iliac Deep Vein Thrombosis:  The patient developed a DVT 
discovered on CT and confirmed with ultrasound.  Given her 
recent brain surgery and history of GI bleeds, the pros and cons 
of anticoagulation were weighed with her neuro- and general 
surgeons.  Based on obtained old records and a discussion with 
the above parties, it was determined that the benefits of 
anticoagulation outweighed the risks.  The patient has been 
briefed on concerning signs of GI Bleed and pulmonary embolism.  
Her PCP agreed to manage her coumadin as an outpatient.  The 
patient tolerated 48 hours of a heparin drip and was 
transitioned to Lovenox/Coumadin which she will continue until 
therapeutic at ___.

4. Atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion:  The patient was 
admitted on Sotalol but converted to metoprolol on this 
hospitalization.  She was rate controlled in the ___ and 
will continue 12.5mg PO BID on discharge.  Anticoagulation per 
problem DVT above.

5. Leukopenia/Anemia: The patient developed a stable and 
non-hemodynamically significant leukopenia and anemia while 
admitted.  These problems have been variously attributed to 
Dilantin, Penicillin and her underlying history of lymphoma s/p 
BMT.  She was repleted with Vitamin B while admitted.  We have 
left the patient instructions to follow up with her PCP & 
Oncologist to monitor these values.  Infectious disease will 
also monitor her blood counts weekly.

6. Hypertension: The patient had no signs of hypertension and 
will continue on Metoprolol.

7. CAD, s/p MI, CABG. The patient was not continued on Aspirin 
due to risk of GI bleed and anticoagulation.  She will follow 
with her PCP on this issue.

8. Anxiety: The patient was continued on Ativan.

Discharge Instructions:
You have been admitted to the hospital for evaluation of a brain 
abscess.  While you were here, our Neurosurgical team was 
successful in draining these abscesses.  Our Infectious Disease 
and Surgical teams evaluated you for a source of infection and 
found that your old bypass surgery had a small but stable leak, 
and this was likely the cause of your infection.  Unfortunately 
while you were here you also developed a blood clot which 
obligates you to 6 months of anticoagulation therapy. 

It has been a long and difficult hospital course and I commend 
you on your continued positive spirits.  It has been a true 
pleasure caring for you during this difficult time.

There have been many changes to your medications including 
antibiotics.  Please ask the nurse for ___ full print out of your 
medications as the most accurate and up to date list.
Of note:
Please stop Sotalol, you will not need this medication at this 
time
Please take your Cipro & Flagyl (antibiotics) every day as 
directed
Please take your Warfarin (Coumadin, blood thinner) as directed 
and follow with Dr. ___ to guide you on dose. Please continue 
enoxaparin until Dr. ___ you otherwise.
Please take valproate, levatiracetem, and fosphenytoin at the 
currently prescribed doses until you are told otherwise by your 
seizure doctor. While on these medications, you should have your 
liver function, platelet count and drug levels drawn and 
monitored by either Dr ___ your seizure doctor.  

Please make all appointments as directed.  For many of our 
specialists, we have made appointments for you but you can find 
a specialist closer to home.

Please make all appointments as scheduled and recommended:
1. Primary Care: ___ ___, ___ @ 
11am
Please tell your Primary care doctor that you need a pelvic 
ultrasound 6 weeks post discharge to evaluate an adnexal cyst

2. Infectious Disease: ___ @ 10:00a  with Dr.

your own neurologist/epileptologist)

4. Neurosurgery: On ___ at 1:40pm you are scheduled for a 
brain MRI, at 2:30pm on the same day you will see Dr ___. The 
MRI is located on the ___ basement of the ___ 
___. Dr ___ is located on the ___ ___ of the ___ 
building behind the ___ on ___. Dr 
___ can be reached at ___.

We recommend the following appointments:
1. Hematologist/Oncologist: Your blood counts were low on this 
admission and this should be followed.

2. Gastroenterologist/Bariatric Surgeon: Our surgeons have no 
operative recommendations regarding your bypass leak, but your 
surgeons may care to re-evaluate you.

Please call your doctor or 911 if you experience worsening or 
uncontrolled head pain, confusion, chest pain, difficulty 
breathing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, black or bloody 
stools or any other concerning medical symptom.

Neurosurgical Instructions:
Have a friend/family member check your incision daily for 
signs of infection.
Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, 
or excessive bending.
You may shower before this time using a shower cap to cover 
your head.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain 
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking 
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) 
while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and 
Ibuprofen etc. 
Clearance to drive and return to work will be addressed at 
your post-operative office visit.

CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE 
FOLLOWING
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status. 
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not 
relieved by pain medication.

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a left parietal mass. She has a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post bone marrow transplant, atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and gastric bypass surgery. She is allergic to penicillins, codeine, and Keflex. 

The patient initially presented with left frontal headaches, right-sided arm and leg weakness, and progressive aphasia. Imaging revealed a ring-enhancing left parietal mass with surrounding edema, suggestive of an abscess with subdural empyema. She underwent stereotactic evacuation of the abscess and burr hole drainage of the subdural empyema. 

The patient was started on vancomycin for strep coverage and cipro/flagyl for concern of infection. She also had refractory seizure activity on continuous EEG monitoring. 

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and her physical exam was normal except for a healing surgical wound. Her laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 2.5, hemoglobin of 9.8, and platelet count of 277. 

The patient's imaging studies showed a small air-fluid collection in the splenic hilum, which was likely a chronic collection. She also had a new multiloculated subdural collection in the left parieto-occipital region. 

The patient was prescribed valproate for seizure control and was advised to follow up with her primary care physician for further management. ||endoftext||"

History of Present Illness:
___ year old man with a history ESRD, on HD ___, DM, HTN, 
CAD s/p IMI with DES in ___ recent stress shows reversible 
defect in inferior wall but overall improved per cardiologist. 
Complained of cough and left sided chest pain, he was then 
having a cough productive of gray and white sputum, he did have 
drenching night sweats, unable to tell if he had weight loss. 
Followed for latent TB infection by Dr. ___ been treated 
with INH, but while being treated was exposed to his son so 
there was a question of whether he could be treated or not. Dr. 
___ feel like he was adequetely treated for TB. The CP was 
constant, sharp, and pleuritic, made worse with climbing stairs, 
similar to angina, EKG showed LVH with early repol abnormality, 
no signs of acute ischemia, was ruled out for MI. With cough, 
night sweats, questionable history of TB, decided he needed to 
be ruled out for TB. On CXR had a LLL infiltrate. Was in sbps in 
180s upon arrival, gave his home meds because they didn't think 
this was urgency and he was 160 systolic prior to HS. They were 
going to start CTX/Azithro after HD the next morning. Around 
___ in AM at 8am, intern spoke with him via interpreter, said 
his CP was improved, and his headache was improved (longstanding 
and worse on HD days), and so at that time moving all his 
extremities, no focal deficits, then had bedside HD after exam, 
and nurse noted that he was moving his extremities, then came in 
around 9:20 for AM rounds found to have flaccid LUE paralysis, 
left nasal-labial fold flattening. CODE STROKE called, taken to 
head CT, showed right MCA perfusion defect with ""penumbra"", but 
no evidence of bleed. BP was 210 systolic. So he was admitted to 
the ___ and started TPA. Wheeled him to the MICU but was 
turned away because no respiration bed. Gave 10 x 2 brought his 
BP down to 177 systpolic, at 1115 pushed TPA on the floor, neuro 
attending at bedside, pushed continuous infusion. By the time 
back to room, still aphasic but starting to move his LUE before 
starting TPA. Then confirmed FULL CODE with family, transferrred 
to ___ under neuro team. Remains aphasic and still has LUE 
weakness, but is moving it, still has nasolabial fold flattening 
on the left. They did see a R carotid stenosis. No a fib on EKG.
  
In Neuro ICU, patient started to speak slowly, so hopefully more 
dysarthria as opposed to enunciating rather than true aphasia. 
Put the order in for an MRI given his cypher stent, but he has 
an unusual intracranial circulation, he is a vasculopath, has 
all the risk factors for large vessel disease, ?embolic 
phenomena, so getting a TTE with bubble study. But now anxious 
and associating HD with stroke unfortunately, need to reiterate 
that with him. Currently, 98  73  147/56 (required 10 of 
labetolol and hydralazine IV this morning for 170s)  15  982L. 
He did pass speech and swallow. He was transferred to the 
medical floor for continued stabilization before discharge to 
home with ___.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. 
  
# ___ EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80. Right bundle-branch block. 
Mild 
prolongation of the Q-T interval. Left ventricular hypertrophy. 
There are 
diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes throughout. Clinical 
correlation is 
suggested.  
  
# ___ CXR:
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural 
effusions and atelectasis. 
  
# ___ EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Non-specific 
ST-T wave 
changes, all of which are unchanged compared with the previous 
tracing. 
  
# ___ CT Brain Perfusion
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. 
2. Relatively small geographic region of abnormally increased 
mean transit 
time, without definite corresponding decreased relative cerebral 
blood volume, 
in the superior right frontal lobe, representing acute ischemic 
(penumbra) in 
the superior division, right MCA territory; there is no similar 
region 
elsewhere. 
3. Unremarkable intracranial circulation; specifically, no 
stenosis or 
occlusion of the right MCA and its branches or the right ICA 
terminus. 
4. Atherosclerotic disease, involving particularly the left 
carotid bulb and 
proximal ICA with at least 65% diameter stenosis at its origin. 
5. Evidence of CHF with bilateral pleural effusions. 
  
# ___ TTE
Conclusion:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters 
are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small 
pericardial effusion. 
  
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Indeterminate indices to assess diastolic dysfunction. No 
pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
  
# ___ CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, there is 
increasing 
opacification at both bases with poor definition of the 
hemidiaphragms 
consistent with pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. 
The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is more prominent, 
though some of this could reflect the AP supine rather than PA 
technique. 
  
# ___ Non Con Head CT
IMPRESSION: 
Residual IV contrast limits optimal evaluation for subtle 
hemorrhage.  
1. New focal hypodense area with loss of gray-white 
differentiation in the 
right frontal lobe corresponding to the previously seen 
perfusion abnormality representing either evolving ischemia or 
infarction.  
2. No large area of hemorrhage in this area or elsewhere within 
limitation of this study. No new edema, mass effect, or shift in 
midline structures. 
  
# ___ TTE Bubble Study
Findings:
No evidence suggestive of an atrial septal defect or patent 
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast 
with maneuvers.  
   
# ___ MRI Head
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Acute infarct in the right posterior frontal lobe involving 
the precentral gyrus which is unchanged. 
   
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or new infarct. 
   
3. Changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 
   
4. Arachnoid cyst versus a prominent cisterna magna in the 
posterior fossa.  
  

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:  ___ yo ___ RHM with h/o ESRD, CAD s/p 
drug-eluting stent placed ___, DM2, HTN, HL, and latent TB 
initially presented on ___ with c/o CP, productive cough and 
night sweats, admitted for MI rule out hospital course c/b 
right-sided acute cerebral infarct s/p tPA on ___, initially 
with motor weakness, left sided facial droop and expressive 
aphasia, now with symmetric strength and no facial droop but 
persistent expressive aphasia. 
  
# Acute Cerebral Infarct: While in dialysis on ___ pt was 
found around 09:20 to have new speech difficulty and LUE flaccid 
weakness. A Code Stroke was called and CTA showed small 
frontoparietal increased MTT/perfusion deficit. He was 
administered tPA starting at approximately 11:15 on ___. He was 
then transfered to the TICU for frequent neuro checks given risk 
of bleed post-tPA. Passed speech and swallow on ___. 
Continued to improve on the medical floor, with equal strength 
and sensation distally. TTE showed no ASD or PFO. Cardiology had 
low suspicion for any left atrial thrombus or appendage 
abnormality, so TEE was recommended for outpatient. Neuro aware 
of left ICA. LDL is 95, so started a statin to obtain less than 
70. Followed daily by neurology. Antihypertensives were 
uptitrated as necessary to bring BP within goal SBP 140-180.  
Patient was placed on Aspirin 325 mg per neuro recs because they 
felt plavix was not a good medication for him.
Treatment Course:
- Captopril 12.5 mg PO TID x1 day
- Captopril 37.5 mg PO TID x3 days
- Lisinopril 40 mg PO DAILY x2 days
- Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO BID x3 days
- Carvedilol 25 mg PO BID x3 days
- Hydralazine ___ mg IV Q6H PRN SBP>180
- Atorvastatin 80 mg daily x6 days
- Aspirin 325 mg PO/NG DAILY x7 days 
- Frequent neuro checks with monitoring for headache as 
indication of possible hemorrhagic conversion or cerebral edema
- Continuous monitoring by telemetry   
- Maintained normothermia  
- Risk Factor Assessment with Lipid panel 
  
# Headache: pt has h/o chronic HA with HD along with dizziness 
and ear ache. ___ have h/o migraine but due to language barrier 
it is described simply as HA. Associated with nausea and 
vomiting. Varies from ___ to ___ in severity.
- Acetaminophen dose to 1000 mg PO Q6H prn pain
- Ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q8H prn pain
- Odansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN nausea/vomiting 
- Elevated HOB to 30 degrees
- Monitored closely for concurrent neurological findings 
- Pt sent with a prescription for Tramadol for break through 
headache pain
  
# No TB infection, ruled out after neg AFBx3 and neg 
concentrated smear. Has been followed for latent TB infection by 
Dr. ___ previously treated with INH. Resolved.
  
# ESRD: has a LUE fistula, after TPA did have more swelling of 
his LUE ?less mobile, non pitting edema, so don't believe there 
is a clot but something to monitor as an outpatient.  Dialysis 
on T, Tr, ___. 
- Monitored by daily Cr, urine output, electrolytes  
  
# No current chest pain on discharge, ruled out for MI with flat 
CK-MB and TpnT.  Resolved.
  
# Pulmonary Edema: Likely ___ fluid overload on admission CXR, 
now resolved.  Sats stable, lung sounds clear.
  
# DM 2: 
- Pt placed on Insulin SS with goal <150.  BG very well 
controlled during this admission.
  
# Anxiety: Pt has increased anxiety following stroke, especially 
around HD, now resolved.
- Pt given Lorazepam 0.5 mg IV PRN anxiety pre-HD.
     
# Consults:
- ___ evaluations for walking stairs, showering without assitance
- Nutrition evaluations for poor PO intake, treated with 
appetite stimulant Megace
- Social work consults for discharge home with services
  
Transitional Issues:
1. Pt still needs a TEE for a better look at possible atrial 
pathology which may have caused this stroke.  Cardiology did not 
feel that this procedure had to be done in house and that he was 
very low risk for having anything that would change our 
management.  For this reason he was set up with cardiology as an 
outpatient to get this TEE.
2. Pt will need close neurology follow up to follow neuro 
deficits and continue to reduce his risk of further stroke.
3. Pt will need close PCP follow up to follow up on new 
medications, medication refills, ongoing neuro deficits, stroke 
risk reduction etc.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
  
You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain which has 
resolved.  Unfortunately, while you were here you had a stroke 
that affected the right side of your brain (and consequently the 
left side of your body). You were given a medication that helps 
to dissolve clots and helps people improve following a stroke.  
Over the few days following the stroke you improved dramatically 
and your motor muscle function appears to be back to baseline.  
As we discussed, the reason for the stroke was secondary to 
years of high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, and 
dialysis that lead to hardening of the arteries, leading to a 
blockage. The key to your recovery lies in your new medications 
including aspirin, atorvastatin, and new blood pressure agents. 
Further, you will benefit from outpatient physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, and speech therapy. We have set you up 
with primary care, cardiology and neurology appointments below. 
    
Additionally, while you were here we tested you for tuberculosis 
and all of our tests were negative, indicating that you do not 
have this infection.
  
The following changes were made to your medications:
STOP Metoprolol
STOP Fluticasone
CHANGE Vitamin B complex vitamins to B complex with Vitamin C 
and Folic Acid, 1 capsule by mouth daily
CHANGE Aspirin from 81 mg daily to 325 mg daily
START Atorvastatin 80 mg by mouth once daily
START Carvedilol 25 mg by mouth twice daily
START Lisinopril 20 mg by mouth twice daily
START Megace 600 mg by mouth once daily
START Tramadol 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for 
headache
  
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.  We wish 
you a speedy recovery.

Cultures:
___ Blood culture: VRE
___ Blood culture X2 negative
___ Blood culture X2 negative

Imaging:
___ MRI soft tissue head: No evidence of enhancing soft 
tissues or fluid collection identified in the neck. There is 
minimal soft-tissue thickening in the partially visualized 
maxillary sinuses. The patient previously had maxillary sinus 
disease on prior sinus CT. if further evaluation of sinuses is 
clinically indicated, consider a repeat sinus CT.  
___ Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There 
is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with 
impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. Dr. ___ was 
notified by telephone on ___ at 4:35 pm. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the pericardial effusion is now larger and there is now right 
ventricular diastolic collapse. Left ventricular systolic 
function appears slightly more vigorous. 
___ Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %) with inferior hypokinesis. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion 
appears circumferential. No right ventricular diastolic collapse 
is seen. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse 
suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt 
tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 
___, no change.  
___ RUQ US: 1. No biliary obstruction or other explanation 
for abnormal LFTs.  2. Trace perihepatic ascites. 3. Right 
pleural effusion. 
4. Moderate pericardial effusion. 
___ CXR: AP chest compared to ___ through ___:   
Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which 
enlarged 
between ___ and ___ is unchanged subsequently. 
Mediastinal and 
pulmonary vascular engorgement are essentially unchanged since 
___, and edema is minimal, if any, difficult to 
distinguish from relatively symmetric infrahilar opacification 
which could also be due to mild-to-moderate atelectasis. There 
is no pulmonary edema or consolidation in the upper lungs. 
___ Echo: Normal LV size with low-normal systolic function. 
Normal right ventricular chamber size and systolic function. 
Moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion with 
evidence of early hemodynamic effect in inversion of the right 
atrium, consistent with increased intrapericardial pressure. No 
definitive signs of pericardial tamponade. In the setting of 
elevated right sided pressures, echocardiographic evidence of 
tamponade may be absent. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation and 
mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the effusion is slightly larger and there is 
slightly more pronounced diastolic inversion of the right 
atrium.  
___ CXR: In comparison with study of ___, there is 
continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with 
less prominent vascular congestion that may reflect the PA 
rather than supine AP technique. Opacification at the left base 
in the retrocardiac region could merely reflect atelectasis, 
though in the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia 
would have to be seriously considered. There is left and 
possibly also right pleural effusion. Scattered streaks of 
atelectasis are seen especially at the left base. 

Pathology: 
___ left shin biopsy: The sections shows patchy superficial 
and mid-dermal hemorrhage. No primary vasculitis/microthrombotic 
vasculitis are seen. There is no evidence of malignancy in this 
specimen. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are present in the 
superficial dermis, compatible with relative chronicity of this 
hemorrhagic episode. The PAS, GMS, and tissue Gram stains are 
negative for microorganisms. Overall, the findings in this 
biopsy are non-specific and are suggestive of purpura (e.g. 
secondary to trauma, etc.). Culture growing enterococcus

___ Bone marrow biopsy: Immunophenotypic findings 
consistent with involvement by persistent involvement by 
patient's known acute leukemia.
As reported previously, the blasts express myeloid markers 
(CD117, CD13) along with B-marker CD19, as well as CD7.  
PERSISTENT ACUTE LEUKEMIA WITH MIXED LINEAGE PHENOTYPE (see 
note).
Note: Blasts comprise 81% of aspirate differential and a 
majority of the core cellularity (overall cellularity 90-100%). 
Compared to the previous biopsy ___ dated 
___, the current marrow shows a significant increase in both 
overall cellularity and blast count.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M with refractory biphenotypic leukemia 
and history of disseminated fusarium infection, on Ambisome and 
voriconazole in the setting of prolonged neutropenia from 
induction chemotherapy. He was recently transferred to the CCU 
for pericardio-centisis on ___ and pericardial drain 
(pulled ___. 
.  
# BIPHENOTYPIC LEUKEMIA: Initial therapy was included hyperCVAD. 
His day 14 marrow showed persistent disease and his regimen was 
changed to 7+3. Two subsequent marrows all continued to show 
persistent involvement with leukemia. Further chemotherapy was 
held as he was found to have disseminated fusarium infection in 
the setting of prolonged neutropenia. He then received 10 days 
of decitabine (C1D41, ___. Continued home neupogen to 
stimulate WBC in setting of fusarium infection. Patient remained 
persistently neutropenic. ___ BM biopsy showed extensive 
disease. The patient then received MEC (C1D1 ___. Following 
this the patient was noted to have persistence of blasts in 
periphery and continued to be pancytopenic. BM on day ___ 
(___) showed >80% blasts. He was discharged with plan to 
discuss possible outpatient chemotherapy trials with primary 
oncologist Dr. ___. Patient was maintained on the following 
ppx regimen: bactrim (switched from atovaquone ___ and 
atovaquone. 
.  
# FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA, BACTEREMIA: pt with low-grade fevers on 
admission. Derm biopsy of left shin showed chronic changes, and 
culture grew out enterococcus (likely seeded from blood, per 
derm). Blood culture from ___ grew VRE. No new murmurs. 
___ echo showed no signs of endocarditis. Patient was 
started on daptomycin for VRE. Repeat blood culture on ___, 
___ negative. Patient's legs stable without tenderness. Biopsy 
site of left shin healing well, still with erythema. Bilateral 
changes appear chronic. He spiked a fever in the CCU on ___ 
after placement of pericardial drain (see problem #4), at which 
point empiric vancomycin and cefepime were started. Per ID recs, 
daptomycin was discontinued. Negative infectious workup, 
including UCx, BCx, pericardial fluid cx, and Quantiferon gold. 
On ___, antibiotics were tapered to PO Levofloxacin. He was 
discharged on Levoquin for ppx as outpatient, given his chronic 
neutropenia. 
.
# DISSEMINATED FUSARIUM INFECTION: occurred in the setting of 
neutropenia after induction chemotherapy. Voriconazole held 
during chemo on ___. Fusarium sensitivities are >4 for 
Ambisome, >16 for Vori. On ___, Ambisome discontinued with 
goal of pt returning home shortly not on ambisome infusions. 
Patient was discharged on voriconazole. Most recent beta glucan 
and galactomannan are negative.
. 
# AFIB WITH RVR: On ___, pt developed new onset Afib with RVR 
to the 140s in the setting of low potassium (has chronically low 
potassium ___ ambisome). CXR WNL, electrolytes repleted, trops 
neg X2. Managed initially with diltiazem, then switched to 
metoprolol and diltiazem per cardiology recs, ultimately 
titrated up to metoprolol 37.5mg PO q6 hours and diltiazem 60mg 
PO q6 hours. HR in low 100s after that, pt asymptomatic. Pt not 
anticoagulated as he is thrombocytopenic. 
.
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: pt with evidence of cardiac tamponade in 
early ___, found on hospitalization to have worsening 
pericardial effusion and RV collapse. Repeat echo ___ showed 
persistent effusion without signs of tamponade. Repeat ___ 
echo unchanged, with elevated pulmonary artery pressures 
(therefore, RV pressures are likely high, even if no RV 
collapse/frank tamponade). On ___ pt had pericardiocentesis 
with placement of pericardial drain, in the setting of starting 
anthracycline with potential for cardiotoxicity and worsening 
EF. He tolerated the procedure well, with inital output around 
500-700 cc and he was transferred to the CCU. While in the CCU 
the patient's pericardial drain output eventually started 
decreasing and it was pulled. Pulsus remained normal throughout. 
Analysis of fluid revealed transudate with reactive inflammatory 
cells; cx (including mycobacteria and fungi) and cytology were 
negative. However, this was still felt to be most likely 
malignant effusion. Repeat TTE on ___ showed persistence of 
small effusion. 
.  
# PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: pt developed significant ___ pleural 
effusions of unknown etiology, most likely cardiac given pulm 
vascular congestion. While pt had no respiratory compromise and 
maintained normal O2 saturations, there was concern for eventual 
compromise of lung expansion given severity of effusion. ___ 
chest tubes placed on ___, with drainage of about 2L on each 
side. Pleural fluid analysis showed transudate with reactive 
inflammatory cells; bacterial/mycobacterial/fungal cultures and 
cytology negative. Removed R chest tube ___, unclamped and 
removed L chest tube on ___. On ___, left pleural effusion 
showed interval worsening. On ___, CXR showed slightly 
improved R atalectasis, stable L pleural effusion. Pt 
intermittently clinically volume overloaded during 
hospitalization, likely ___ his cardiopulmonary issues as well 
as fluid overload from chemo. He received IV lasix and PO 
spironolactone, transitioning to PO lasix and then ultimately 
discharged on only spironolactone 20mg PO daily.  
.
# RV STRAIN ON TTE: After the pericardial drain was place and 
then later pulled, echocardiogram showed new significant RV 
strain and volume overload. PE was high on DDx. Negative LENIs 
and VQ scan (performed in lieu of CTA ___ rising creatinine and 
thrombocytopenia).
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: While in the CCU, the patient developed 
acute renal failure, with creatinine trending up to 2.1 in the 
context of spiking a fever. Found to be prerenal in etiology as 
well as from ATN, improved somewhat with IV fluids. Meds renally 
dosed, nephrotoxins avoided. 
.
# ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA: ___ leukemia, as well as autoimmune 
destruction and splenic sequestration (pt with massive 
splenomegaly). Patient requiring frequent (q1-2 days) blood and 
platelet transfusions. Goal HCT>25, platelets>20 (or >20 if 
having nosebleed). 
.
# HEPATITIS B: patient with positive surface and core antibodies 
in ___. Patient is maintained on Lamivudine. Pt with mildly 
elevated LFTs during hospitalization, which improved after 
Bactrim was discontinued. Bactrim then restarted without issues. 

.  
# MECHANICAL FALL: pt had mechanical fall while walking from the 
bathroom on the evening of ___ with minor head trauma and no 
other injuries. Given his thrombocytopenia, received immediate 
transfusion 2 units platelets. STAT head CT showed no acute 
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or skull fracture but was notable 
for left frontal subgaleal hematoma. Serial neurologic exams 
WNL. Follow up head CT one week later revealed resolving left 
frontal subgaleal hematoma. Pt suffered no consequent 
disabilities as a result of this incident.
.  
# ORAL LESION: located under patient's dentures. It is unclear 
how long it has been present for, but seems to be chronic mass 
(possibly congenital) that is newly irritated X4-5days by 
dentures. MR showed no evidence of enhancing soft tissues or 
fluid collection. Mass does not appear infected and was only 
monitored on admission.
.  
# MOOD INSTABILITY: Patient has a history of mood instability, 
managed on olanzapine. This was continued during 
hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital.  You were 
admitted because your doctors suspected your ___ was 
worsening.  Your treatment for the fungal infection was 
continued.  You were found to have a bacteria (called 
Enterococcus) growing in your blood and on skin biopsy and so 
you were treated with an antibiotic called daptomycin.  You got 
several imaging studies of your heart because we were worried 
about the fluid around it.  You were given small doses of lasix 
to manage the extra fluid in your body and to help you breathe 
more easily.  You also had irregular and rapid heart beat 
(atrial fibrillation) which we treated with diltiazem and 
metoprolol. Finally, you had a repeat bone marrow biopsy that 
showed persistent leukemia.  After discussion with your family 
and Dr. ___ was decided that you would be discharged home 
with outpatient followup to determine how to proceed with your 
care. 

Please attend the follow-up appointments with Dr. ___ 
nursing listed below.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STARTED diltiazem 60mg by mouth every 6 hours
2. STARTED metoprolol succinate 150mg by mouth once daily
3. STARTED spironolactone 25mg by mouth daily
4. STARTED bactrim DS (double strength) on ___ 
and ___
5. STARTED ipratropium nebulizer 1 treatment every 4 hours as 
needed for wheezing/shortness of breath
6. INCREASED voriconazole to 300mg by mouth twice daily (from 
300mg by mouth once daily)
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of disseminated fusarium, VRE bacteremia. He has a past medical history of biphenotypic leukemia, which was initially treated with steroids and IVIG, and later with hyperCVAD and 7+3 chemotherapy. He was also diagnosed with disseminated fusarium infection and treated with Ambisome and voriconazole. The patient has no known allergies or adverse drug reactions.

The patient was admitted to the hospital for a new lesion on his congenital oral mass, which is concerning for persistent and worsening fungal infection. He has been experiencing pain in his mouth, but has not taken pain medication. He also developed painless, nonpruritic erythematous blanching patches on his shins bilaterally.

The patient's physical examination revealed a pleasant elderly male in no acute distress, with a normal chest and abdominal examination. He had petechiae on his lower abdomen, legs, and feet, as well as erythematous, blanching patches on his anterior shins with superficial ulcerations bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 0.3, with 28% blasts, and a platelet count of 10%. His liver function tests were abnormal, with elevated levels of ALT, AST, and LDH. His blood cultures were positive for VRE.

The patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy and skin biopsy, and was treated with decitabine and Ambisome. He was also prescribed medications at discharge, including voriconazole and Lamivudine.

Overall, the patient's diagnosis is disseminated fusarium infection, VRE bacteremia, and biphenotypic leukemia. He is being treated with antifungal and antibacterial medications, and will require ongoing monitoring and management of his condition. ||endoftext||"

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with anemia (a low blood count) which is the 
likely result of chronic bleeding and resuling iron deficiency.  
You received a blood transfusion, improving your blood count.

An upper endoscopy (EGD) was performed and showed a 3cm ulcer in 
the stomach.  Biopsies were taken and Dr. ___ call 
you with the results within one week.  You also need a repeat 
endoscopy in about 6 weeks.

To help treat this, we have prescribed pantoprazole (Protonix). 
This medication should be taken twice per day. 

In addition, we have prescribed iron supplements. These should 
be taken at least twice per day (three times per day if you 
tolerated it). Given your current constipation and the fact that 
iron often worsens constipation, a stool softener was 
prescribed.

STUDIES: 
================================

CHEST (PA & LAT) (___): 
Increased left perihilar and lower lung opacities concerning for 
pneumonia.

portable CXR ___:
Lung volumes are appreciably lower today than on ___ and 
there is 
greater pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild pulmonary edema. 
 The previous appearance reflect dz substantial COPD.  
Consolidative abnormalities in the lung apices were due to 
scarring. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusions are presumed, 
but not substantial. 

Post PPM CXR ___:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received 
a new left pectoral pacemaker.  1 lead projects over the 
coronary sinus and 1 over the right atrium.  No evidence of 
complications, notably no pneumothorax. The pre-existing, 
relatively diffuse lung parenchymal opacities are constant in 
extent and distribution.

CXR ___: 
FINDINGS:  
  
The diffuse interstitial opacities are worsening compared with 
the prior study of ___, likely representing 
progressive interstitial edema. A developing opacity at the left 
costophrenic angle was not present on the prior study of ___, and may be atelectasis, but superimposed 
infection cannot be ruled out.  The attention is recommended on 
subsequent followup imaging.  Surgical clips in the 
reconstructed right breast are unchanged. The dual chamber left 
chest wall pacemaker leads are in unchanged position. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Increased diffuse interstitial opacities, which likely 
representing progressive interstitial edema. 
2. Focal consolidation in the anteromedial segment of left lower 
lobe, which may represent pneumonia considering history of 
ongoing treatment of pneumonia. 

TTE ___:
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Mild aoric stenosis. Mild 
aortic and mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension.  

___ Left Upper Extremity U/S with doppler: 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left 
upper extremity.

================
ACUTE ISSUES
================

# Mobitz Type I Heart block: 2:1 2nd degree AV block; given 
prolonged PR interval, likely Mobitz Type I. Patient's 
electrical conduction abnormality possibly related to past 
adriamycin vs. prior XRT. Lyme ab negative, TSH elevated at 5.2 
with normal T4 at 5.1. Low suspicion for infiltrative diseases, 
infiltrative malignancies, or collagen vascular diseases. 
Patient had AS/DS ___ dual chamber pacemaker placed ___ 
without complication. Patient has f/u appointment scheduled with 
device clinic Dr. ___ ___. 
  
# Dyspnea: Concerning for CHF vs. everolimus-induced lung 
toxicity vs. pneumonia. Pulmonary was consulted. She was treated 
for possible CAP with Ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She was 
diuresed (see below). Everolimus was held due to possible 
toxicity, but she was not thought to require steroids. Will need 
pulmonary follow-up with repeat thoracic imaging and full PFTs 
in ___ weeks after acute process  

# Congestive Heart Failure (newly diagnosed) HFpEF- evidenced by 
evidenced by DOE x 5d, vascular congestion on CXR, and BNP 47___. 
Systolic function preserved with EF >55%. Given rapid onset of 
symptoms, CHF likely likely ___ second-degree 2:1 AV block, TTE 
showed preserved EF without focal wall motion abnormalities to 
suggest ischemia or global wall motion abnormalities to suggest 
chemotherapy toxicity. Patient symptoms improved with diuresis 
and pacemaker placement, appeared euvolemic on discharge, off 
oxygen, with weight 136lbs.

# Possible Everolimus-induced lung toxicity: likely contributing 
to chronic dyspnea via ILD mechanism. CT nonspecific but still 
concerning for everolimus-induced pneumonitis. Everolimus held 
during hospitalization. 

# Pneumonia- Patient without cough, fevers, leukocytosis, though 
given dyspnea and imaging with lower lung opacities raising 
concern for multifocal pneumonia. Patient treatd with 5 day 
course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP. Urine legionella 
negative. 

#LUE swelling- Most likely due to IV infiltration, but given 
breast cancer history, obtained left upper extremity ultrasound 
with doppler which did not show evidence of DVT. 

# Metastatic ER+ Breast Cancer: s/p bilateral mastectomy, 
Adriamycin x5, tamoxifen, Arimidex, exemestane, Faslodex, XRT to 
left axillary nodes and subpectoralis nodes, Xeloda. Currently 
on on everolimus and exemestane. After consultation with 
patient's outpatient oncologist, Dr. ___, decision made 
to discontinue everolimus. Exemestane was continued during this 
admission.

================
CHRONIC ISSUES
================
# Glaucoma: Continued home latanoprost

# L greater trochanteric bursitis: s/p injection and she says 
she has had 90% pain relief. She could have repeat injections at 
three months, but nothing in the interim. Continued Lidoderm 
patch

blood loss and aggressive diuresis at ___.  Improved 
with fluid and blood administration.

3) COPD:  Continued Spiriva & Atrovent prn.  Administered Flu 
vaccine & Pneumovax. Recomended outpatient Pulmonary referal and 
PFTs.

4) Atrial Fibrillation:  Likely related to atrial stretch. Echo 
with dilated atrium. Unlikely ischemia given negative cardiac 
enzymes. ___ normal and B1 pnd on discharge.  Cardiology 
consulted, did not recommend cardioversion considering increased 
risk of thrombosis following cardioversion and unable to 
anticoagulate currently. CHADS score of 2. Warfarin was stopped 
given bleeding. Would consider anticoagulation in the future.  

5) Congestive heart failure: unclear etiology but likely 
longstanding given atrial enlargement. Etiologies may include 
HTN or even restrictive process in setting of EtOH use. Held 
beta blockade while patient hemodynamically unstable. Discharged

Discharge Instructions:
You were transfered from ___ with bleeding in the back 
of your belly which was atributed to blood thining medications. 
We gave you blood products to reverse the thinning properties of 
your blood. Also at ___ you were noted to have congestive 
heart failure and atrial fibrilation. We gave you medication to 
help control heart rate (metoprolol). Excess fluid from was 
removed your body with water pills. We are not prescribing any 
water pills at this time as you did not have edema (swelling) of 
your extremities when we examined you. Please discuss the need 
for water pills with your regular doctor/cardiologist. It is 
very important that you maintain a less than 2gm of salt diet 
daily to prevent a reaccumulation of fluid. Please weigh 
yourself daily and call your primary care physician if you gain 
more than 3 pounds. 
.
You should discuss with your regular doctor the need for blood 
thining medication to prevent clots forming in your heart (in 
the seting of atrial fibrilation). At this point we are not 
giving you coumadin because of the risk for bleeding. You should 
start taking aspirin 81mg daily for stroke prevention with 
atrial fibrillation. 
.
You need to follow up with a pulmonary doctor to have pulmonary 
function tests and with a cardiologist in order to help 
determine a long term medication regimen for you congestive 
heart failure. You should continue the medications Toprol XL and 
Enalapril to treat your heart failure. You should also discuss 
referral to ___ with your primary care 
physician. You have been given a list of phone numbers for 
further information. 

We made the following chages in your medicaiton regimen. We 
added albuterol which you should take in addition to spiriva and 
advair. Also we added metoprolol instead of atenolol for your 
atrial fibrilation. 
.
Also your blood count was noted to be low and you may need 
outpatient work up for anemia with your regular doctor. 

Please call your regular doctor or return to the ED if you have 
shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, swelling of 
extermities or any other symptoms that concern you.

BRIEF SUMMARY 
==================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of Crohn's 
disease previously well controlled on mesalamine, CAD s/p stent 
___ years ago, and polymyalgia rheumatica who presented with 2 
weeks of abdominal pain, diarrhea and poor PO, found to have a 
Crohn's flare as well as concurrent c diff infection. He was 
treated with IV methylprednisolone without marked improvement, 
so he was started on infliximab on ___, to good effect, and 
transitioned to PO prednisone for discharge. He is receiving PO 
Vancomycin for the c diff infection. 

=====================
PROBLEM-BASED SUMMARY 
=====================

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: 

# Crohn's disease 
Patient has a long history of Crohn's disease, previously well 
controlled on mesalamine with the last flare ___ years ago. CT 
A/P performed on ___ at ___, and reviewed 
by ___ radiology, showed colitis from the transverse to the 
descending colon. Colonoscopy this admission showed deep 
circumferential ulcerations from the transverse colon through to 
the sigmoid colon, with pathology revealing chronic severely 
active colitis with ulceration in the descending colon. 
Presentation felt to be most consistent with Crohn's flare. He 
received IV methylprednisolone without appropriate improvement, 
so was started on infliximab (first infusion ___, 10 mg/kg), 
which he tolerated well. He was evaluated by colorectal surgery; 
no need for acute intervention. He improved symptomatically 
after the infliximab and was transitioned to PO prednisone for 
discharge. He is planned for a repeat infusion of infliximab at 
1 week (10mg/kg), for an escalated induction dosing, arranged 
with his outpatient GI, Dr. ___ ___. He will be 
discharged on prednisone PO 40mg daily. 

# C Diff 
Patient presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea, WBC 14.5 on 
admission, positive c diff. He was treated with PO Vancomycin, 
for a planned 14-day course (day ___, last day will be on 
___. To our knowledge, this is his first episode of c diff 
infection. 

# Hematochezia 
Patient had one episode of hematochezia in the ED, with no other 
events. Possible source may be related to colitis. There was no 
concern for active GI bleeding during admission. 

# Malnutrition
Patient was followed by nutrition while inpatient. By discharge, 
he was tolerating improved PO and eating well. 

CHRONIC PROBLEMS: 

# Anemia 
Patient reports a history of chronic anemia on home B12. 
Discharge hemoglobin was 10.3. 

# CAD 
Home clopidogrel was held this admission, as his last stent was 
placed ___ years ago. He was continued on home atorvastatin and 
aspirin. Attempt was made to reach out to outpatient 
cardiologist Dr. ___ by email regarding the clopidogrel. 
Please readdress clopidogrel at his outpatient cardiology 
appointment. 

# PMR: Stable.

patient has a right-sided PICC line.  The course of the line is 
unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the lower SVC.  
No evidence of complications.  Moderate scoliosis with asymmetry 
of the rib cage.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia, no pleural 
effusion.  Tortuosity of the calcified thoracic aorta.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o with h/o PG who presents with nonhealing LLE ulcer, seen 
by Derm, Wound Care, Plastics, and being treated for confirmed 
PG on biopsy, pain management, with work-up for associated PG 
conditions negative.

# Nausea: Pt complaining of significant nausea w/emesis off and 
on during hospitalization, with improvement when medications 
were minimized. Similar complaints during previous 
hospitalization, in the setting of opioid pain management. She 
continued to tolerate diet, have bowel movements and had no 
concerning exam findings. She was utilizing ODT zofran at 
discharge with good benefit - we also spaced her medications.

# Elevated creatinine: Creatinine up to 1.2 this admission from 
baseline 1.0.  Most likely secondary to poor oral intake ___ 
nausea, thus gave IV fluids with response. Of note, creatinine 
needs to be monitored closely given pt currently on lovenox.  
Factor Xa 0.61 (___).

# Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Seen by ID at ___ prior to 
transfer, who did not see any evidence of infection, 
discontinued all abx and she remained afebrile and without 
leukocytosis this admission. OSH CT reviewed, currently no 
concern for infection. Work-up initiated in house for conditions 
associated with PG, with negative ___, ANCA, hepatitis panel, 
RF, SPEP/UPEP; last colonoscopy negative per patient. She was 
evaluated by dermatology who recommended oral dapsone 
(minocycline was not tolerated given significant nausea 
concerns) and they performed intralesional corticosteroid 
injection this admission -- as well as applying topical steroids 
to the wound edges. We also employed careful wound care with 
xeroform, telfa and kerlex wrappings daily. Plastic surgery 
evaluated the wound and felt that if healing continues she may 
be a candidate for a STSG going forward. Her pain was controlled 
with oxycodone and she refused acetaminophen. She was discharged 
with wound care and follow-up with above specialists.

# DVT: RLE DVT diagnosed in ___ early this year.  Patient not 
willing to start coumadin.  Continued Lovenox per weight/height 
at 50 mg SC daily (but creatinine clearance is borderline). 
Factor Xa 0.61 (___).  Will need to follow up as an outpatient 
with primary care physician.

# HTN: Continued atenolol without issue.

TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:
- consider oral appetite stimulant given recent weight loss; 
work-up for associated PG disease conditions reassuring; 
age-appropriate screening reportedly normal
- aggressive wound care as outlined in discharge paperwork; 
follow-up with plastic surgery and dermatology
- monitoring for nausea impairing medication compliance
- continue work-up for associated PG conditions (e.g. repeat 
colonoscopy?)
- oral dapsone needs monitoring with weekly CBC with 
differential and reticulocyte count monitoring

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your admission 
to ___. You were admitted for a 
non-healing ulcer on your left leg.  You received wound care and 
local as well as systemic treatment was initiated for a 
diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum.  There was no concern for 
infection, thus antibiotics were not needed.  You were provided 
with pain management with tylenol, oxycodone and dilaudid.  In 
addition, you were continued on a blood thinning medication to 
protect against further clotting, given the history of a blood 
clot in your right leg.

You also had evidence of mild nausea which was likely medication 
related. Please use the oral zofran tablet for these symptoms.

IMAGING/OTHER DIAGNOSTIC:
==========================
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Opacity at the right lung base likely in part due to effusion 
with possible loculation laterally with adjacent parenchymal 
opacity, potentially in part atelectasis noting that infection 
or mass are entirely possible.  Suspected left pleural effusion 
and atelectasis. Leftward deviation of the upper thoracic 
trachea. Correlation with cross-sectional imaging may help 
further characterize these findings unless prior exam is 
available for comparison.

___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Overall unchanged cardiopulmonary findings. New patchy opacities 
within the left midlung could possibly have been obscured by the 
overlying left chest wall battery pack on the prior radiograph, 
but nonetheless are concerning for pneumonia given the provided 
clinical history.

___ Transthoracic Echo Report
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is moderately enlarged. A prominent Eustachian valve is 
present (normal variant). There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal left ventricular wall 
thickness with a mildly increased/dilated cavity. There is 
SEVERE regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls (see schematic) 
and severe global hypokinesis of the remaining segments. There 
is beat-to-beat variability in the left ventricular 
contractility due to the irregular rhythm. Quantitative biplane 
left ventricular ejection fraction is 13 %. There is no resting 
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal 
defect is seen. Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild 
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic sinus diameter is 
normal for gender with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. There is trace aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. The transmitral E-wave deceleration time is short 
(consistent with restrictive left ventricular filling). There is 
mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is mild to moderate [___] 
tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal but may be 
underestimated due to shadowing. The estimated pulmonary artery 
ejection time is 86 consistent with mildly elevated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressures. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Bilateral pleural effusions are present.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness with mild to 
moderate cavity dilation and severe regional and global systolic 
dysfunction c/w a mixed ischemic (in an RCA distribution) and 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy with beat to beat variabiltiy in 
systolic function. Restrictive left ventricuar filling. At least 
mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild mitral 
regurgitation.

___ TTE
There is no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage.The left atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is mildly depressed. No spontaneous echo 
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is normal. There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is depressed. The right ventricle has 
depressed free wall motion. There are simple atheroma in the 
aortic arch with simple atheroma in the descending aorta. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No abscess is
seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the mitral valve.
No abscess is seen. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not
be estimated.

___ Abdominal US
1.  Multiple liver masses consistent with metastatic disease. 
2.  Mid abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 4 cm 
3.  Small right pleural effusion 

___ CT A/P
1. Multiple liver lesions concerning for metastatic disease 
2. Mild thickening of the left adrenal gland, metastasis cannot 
be excluded. 

___ CT Chest
1. Extensive soft tissue mass in the right lower lobe spanning 
10.1 x 5.7 x 11.9 cm, causing obstruction of the right bronchus 
intermedius, is concerning for malignancy.  There is extensive 
mediastinal and right hilar 
lymphadenopathy, as well as axillary and supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy.  
Findings are suggestive of small cell lung cancer versus poorly 
differentiated carcinoma of the lung. 
2. Please see separate report of CT abdomen and pelvis performed 
same day for description of subdiaphragmatic findings. 

___ Barium Study
Very limited evaluation secondary to patient's limited mobility. 
 There was no obstruction noted within the esophagus. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY STATEMENT: 
==========================
MR. ___ is a ___ with PMH of HTN, HLD, CAD (s/p DES x2 to ___ 
in ___, HFrEF (EF 10%),
Afib on Coumadin, and prior treated lung CA who initially 
presented with dyspnea and chest pain, found to have cardiogenic 
shock, possibly in the setting of a pneumonia, complicated by 
Type II NSTEMI. Course further complicated by imaging that 
showed metastatic cancer, and patient ultimately discharged with 
hospice. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============
# Goals of care
# Metastatic cancer
Noted to have significant weight loss with concern for 
malignancy. CT torso obtained and showed a soft tissue mass in 
the RLL of the lung and multiple liver lesions, concerning for 
metastatic small cell lung cancer vs. poorly differentiated 
carcinoma of the lung. Goals of care meeting held with patient 
and family, and ultimately, decision was made to pursue hospice 
care. Pain was controlled with oxycodone and tylenol. 

# Cardiogenic shock ___ HFrEF exacerbation 
On arrival to CCU, hypotensive requiring support with 
vasopressors. Diuresed with IV Lasix gtt and treated with broad 
spectrum antibiotics for presumed PNA, which was felt to be the 
trigger of his heart failure exacerbation. Ultimately improved 
and was weaned off pressor support. Patient underwent RHC on 
___ that showed low biventricular filling pressures, so 
diuresis was subsequently held. Continued on isordil for 
afterload reduction, and unable to tolerate re-addition of beta 
blocker. Discontinued isordil and bblocker on discharge. 
Continued aspirin. 

# Chest pain 
# Type II NSTEMI
Likely in the setting of pneumonia and HFrEF exacerbation. ECG 
with atrial fibrillation, RBBB, intermittent VPCs, and 
non-specific ST-TW changes. Troponins peaked at 0.56. Continued 
to have intermittent chest pain, and on re-check, ECG unchanged 
and troponins elevated to peak of 1.46. Chest pain improved with 
Tums and magic mouth wash, suggesting possible GERD/esophageal 
dysmotility, but persisted despite treatment. Likely has 
component of CAD, so nitrates were uptitrated. Continued on 
asprin and stopped atorvastatin due to potential side effects. 
Chest pain likely in the setting of metastatic cancer (see 
above). 

# Pneumonia
CXR with concern for RLL pneumonia, also with leukocytosis and 
cough. Treated with 7d course of cefepime. 

# Atrial Fibrillation
# Frequent PVCs
# Supertherapeutic INR
CHADS2-VASC 5. Beta blocker initially held in the setting of 
shock, subsequently held due to low-normal systolic blood 
pressures. Warfarin held in the setting of supratherapeutic INRs 
(long-standing issue, per family). Treated with amiodarone for 
frequent PVCs and electrolytes closely monitored and repleted. 

# ___
Cr uptrending to peak of 3.0, ultimately stable at 2.7. 
Initially felt to be cardiorenal, but continued to uptrend after 
diuresis was held. Subsequently felt to be pre-renal vs. ATN 
from hypotension. Urine studies consistent with pre-renal 
etiology. Encouraged PO intake. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
===============
# HLD
Continued home atorvastatin 40 mg daily 

# Gout
Continued home allopurinol ___ mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were feeling short 
of breath and having chest pain. 

In the hospital, you were treated for an exacerbation of your 
heart failure with medications to help remove extra fluid from 
your body. You were also treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. 
You continued having chest pain, and imaging showed that you 
have cancer, which we believe is causing your pain. We had a 
discussion with you and your family, and ultimately, you decided 
to pursue hospice care. 

When you leave the hospital, you should continue taking the 
medications that help you feel comfortable. You should follow up 
with your primary care doctor as needed. 

It was a privilege caring for you, and we wish you well. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

eval for hepatic
   pathology and doppler for patency of vessels
Final Report
INDICATION: Liver cirrhosis. Query patency of vessels.
 
Comparison made to previous ultrasound dated ___.
 
FINDINGS: The liver has a coarse echotexture, and is of 
increased
echogenicity with an irregular outline in keeping the patient's 
known history
of cirrhosis. No intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. No focal 
abnormality
within the liver.
 
There is a significant amount of ascites.
 
Normal flow identified within the main and left hepatic 
arteries. Normal flow
identified within the main hepatic vein, left and right hepatic 
veins. There
is bidirectional flow identified in the main portal vein. There 
is
recanalization of the umbilical vein, which demonstrates flow 
away from the
liver.
 
The spleen measures 15.3 cm longitudinally, which is mildly 
enlarged. It has
normal echogenicity with no focal abnormality.
 
The splenic vein and superior mesenteric veins are not well 
visualized due to
overlying bowel gas and therefore not be evaluated.
 
CONCLUSION:
1. Normal flow identified within the hepatic artery. 
Bidirectional flow
identified within the portal vein. This was present on patients 
most recent US
(___) Normal flow identified within the hepatic veins.
 
2. Findings in keeping with liver cirrhosis and portal 
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient with recent admission for 
hepatic encephalopathy and report of non-compliance with 
medications for which he was dicharged on ___. Two days prior 
to admission his NG tube came out while he was vomiting. He then 
stopped taking his medications and his MS began to deteriorate. 
He was admitted w/ AMS. Infectious w/u was negative for SBP or 
any other infectious source, no source for bleeding was found 
and his RUQ was normal. He was diagnosed w/ hepatic 
encephalopathy and started on lactulose enenmas on admission as 
he could not take PO.  NG tube placement attempted by NF and ___ 
but pt was too combative and still altered on HD 2. Once his MS 
improved he was switched to PO lactulose and started on 
rifaxamin. His MS continued to improve and it was back to 
baseline on HD3. His NGT came out on a second occasion and this 
time it was replaced on the floor, followed by advancement to 
post-pyloric by ___. His MS remained at baseline for the rest of 
his hospitalization. 
.
#. Acute kidney injury: Patient presented with Cr of 2.7 
elevated from 2.0 upon last discharge. This was thought to be 
due to pre-renal azotemia because of dehydration as pt not 
taking enough PO when NGT came out initially, with a possible 
component of HRS. He was treated w/ albumin 1g/kg for 48hrs 
empirically and his Cr remained elevated. He was then treated 
for HRS w/ octreotide/midodrine/albumin. Once his Cr had 
improved octreotide and albumin were discontinued. He was 
continued on midodrine and was discharged on this medication. 
His Cr 1.8 was on discharge (baseline 1.5-1.7).
.
#. Alcoholic cirrhosis: Pt w/ known alc cirrhosis, currently 
inactivated from transplant list as pt non-compliant and w/ 
insurance issues. His treatment was as above. He underwent small 
volume paracentesis x2 for abdominal discomfort without 
complications.
.
#. Fever: Pt developed a low grade fever to 100.3 during his 
admission. This was thought to be due to high temp in his room, 
as his infectious work up was (-) as previously mentioned. Pt 
remained asymptomatic, w/o chills or night sweats, WBC remained 
in the normal range and he had no more fevers.
.
# Hyponatremia: Patient was found to be hyponatremic Na 132 on 
HD 5. This was thought to be due to dehydration as pt not taking 
much PO and no TF as NGT was out and it resolved after 
hydration. His FeNa was calculated at 0.17% supporting this 
diagnosis. He remained asymptomatic throughout admission.
.
# UTI: Patient's urine culture was found to be positive for on 
___ days prior to discharge. This results were not reported 
while the patient was admitted. He was called on and he denied 
any UTI symptoms. He was instructed to return to the hospital if 
he developed any symptoms and to follow up in the hepatology 
offices on ___ for repeat UA and UCx.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Cholangitis: Patient underwent ERCP which showed multiple 
filling defects c/w sludge/stones. Pus and sludge were noted to 
be draining from the bile duct during ERCP. A pig tail biliary 
stent was placed in the common hepatic duct. Patient was 
intubated for procedure, and was extubated the same day without 
difficulty. Zosyn was continued on transfer (started ___ and 
converted to Ciprofloxacin 500mg po Q12H on ___. Initial 
transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia improved during hospital 
course (on discharge AST/ALT 44/62, TBili 3.5. Of note, 
patient's alkaline phosphatase continued to rise during 
hospitalization (in three days prior to admission 225, 438, and 
480 on discharge). Elevation was thought to be ___ evolving 
hepatic injury vs. cholestasis/ductal obstruction. After 
discussion with the GI service, it was felt that the patient was 
safe to return home with close PCP ___ and re-check of alk phos 
within 5 days (appointment has been scheduled). Presence of 
declining bili, and alk phos trend was reassuring. The plan per 
discussion with ERCP/GI service is for total 2wk course of 
Ciprofloxacin. 
. 
#Hypotension: Initially noted to be hypotensive (BP 80/50). Home 
ACEI, Beta Blocker were held on admission. Required 
Vaso/Norepinephrine initially. Also required Dopamine post-ERCP. 
Dopamine was weaned on HD2 and Vaso/Norepinephrine weaned HD3. 
Patient subsequently remained normotensive, hemodynamically 
stable. 
.
#AoCRF: Noted to be ARF on admission (Cr 2.7) which returned to 
baseline (baseline Cr 1.7-2) with aggressive IVF hydration, BP 
support. CKD likely ___ HTN vs. ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.
.
#Heme: Normocytic anemia likely ___ AOCD vs. CKD. There was no 
evidence of bleed or hemolysis. Anemia studies (Fe 51, TIBC 221, 
Ferritin 265) were c/w AOCD. Patient was also noted to be 
thrombocytopenic on admission (Platelets 75). Available data 
suggests thrombocytopenia is chronic (baseline 100-130s). There 
was no evidence of DIC, though admission thrombocytopenia below 
baseline was presumed ___ septic physiology. A blood smear was 
evaluated and was unrevealing. Of note, there are prior reports 
of prosthetic valve related thrombocytopenia (?auto-immune 
mechanism). No clear mechanism of marrow hypo-proliferation or 
destruction. Given known chronicity, and stability of 
thrombocytopenia during hospitalization, there was low concern 
for HIT.   
.
#AF: Initial rate-control agent (Metoprolol) was held ___ 
hypotension on admission. Home dose metoprolol 25mg BID was 
re-started on HD4. There were no episodes of AF/RVR. Patient's 
ASA 325mg was continued and further anti-coagulation was 
deferred per home regimen given hx of significant GIB.  
.
#CAD/Cardiomyopathy/CHF: No episodes CP during admission. 
Troponins were checked at the OSH and were negative. Home dose 
ACEI, statin were held initially. Patient's ACEI (Lisinopril 5mg 
po qd) was re-started on HD4. Patient's statin was held during 
hospitalization given transaminitis. Patient was discharged home 
with instructions to re-start statin. 
.
#Hypoxemia: Thought to be ___ aggressive IVF (+TBB 8L in ICU) in 
the setting of poor underlying respiratory substrate ___ COPD). 
Initially requiring 3L O2, weaned to 2L by HD2 and patient 
remained stably on RA for duration of admission. Day prior to 
discharge patient received Lasix 20mg IV with notable diuresis 
and subjective improvement of dyspnea. He also received Atrovent 
and Albuterol Q6H during hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. You had a rigid 
bronchoscopy (procedure to look in your lungs) with cryptherapy 
and electrocautery to help open your airways and improve your 
breathing. After the procedure you had shortness of breath and 
likely had a blockage of your airway from a mucous plug or blood 
clot. You were admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation 
(breathing mask) and respiratory monitoring. Your breathing 
improved tremendously overnight and your x-ray showed 
improvement. You also received steroids after the procedure, 
which were subsequently stopped. 

The Interventional Pulmonology team was very involved in your 
care, and felt that your breathing was greatly improved and you 
were safe for discharge, with follow-up in clinic in one month 
with a CT scan of your airways. 

We did not change any of your medications. 

Please follow-up at your appointments below.

= 500.2 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 697 mGy-cm. COMPARISON: CT 
abdomen and pelvis dated ___. FINDINGS: VASCULAR: 
There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is minimal calcium 
burden in the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries. 
LOWER CHEST: Mild atelectasis within the lingula. No focal 
consolidations. No pleural or pericardial effusions. ABDOMEN: 
Large volume loculated ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis 
with associated nodular peritoneal thickening and enhancement, 
which has increased compared to prior, compatible with malignant 
ascites. There are extensive peritoneal and omental implants. 
The largest implant along the left pericolic gutter measures 
approximately 15.0 cm in anteroposterior diameter, which has 
increased compared to the CT dated ___ (series 5, 
image 91). An implant within the lower right pericolic gutter 
also appears more bulky compared to prior (series 5, image 133). 
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no 
evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The 
gallbladder is within normal limits, without stones or 
gallbladder wall thickening. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal 
attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or 
pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic 
stranding. SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation 
throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. ADRENALS: The 
right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. 
URINARY: A subcentimeter hypodensity within the lower pole of 
the left kidney is unchanged compared to prior, too small to 
characterize, but likely a cyst (series 5, image 68). Otherwise, 
the kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal 
nephrogram. There is no evidence of stones, new focal renal 
lesions, or hydronephrosis. There are no urothelial lesions in 
the kidneys or ureters. There is no perinephric abnormality. 
GASTROINTESTINAL: Other than mass effect from the large necrotic 
pelvic mass, the small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, 
wall thickness and enhancement throughout. Colon and rectum are 
within normal limits. Appendix is not visualized. 
RETROPERITONEUM: A large necrotic aortocaval lymph node measures 
approximately 3.5 x 2.1 cm. PELVIS: There is mass effect on the 
bladder from the large necrotic pelvic mass. Otherwise, the 
urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no 
inguinal lymphadenopathy. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The large 
necrotic pelvic mass has increased in size measuring 17.0 cm in 
maximum axial ___, and measuring 18.4 cm in the sagittal 
plane. There is also significant mass effect on pelvic small and 
large bowel loops. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome 
osseous lesions or acute fracture. SOFT TISSUES: There are 2 
small left lower ventral hernias containing fluid (series 5, 
image 126, 135). IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of bowel ischemia. 
2. Large necrotic pelvic mass has increased in size, now 
measuring up to 18.4 cm. Persistent mass effect upon the bladder 
and pelvic bowel loops. 3. Malignant ascites with nodular 
peritoneal and thickening and peritoneal/omental implants, also 
increased compared to the prior examination.

PERTINENT STUDIES
==================
CHEST XRAY ___
FINDINGS:  
Right Port-A-Cath is in appropriate positioning.  Air-filled 
lucency in the left lung field is better assessed on CT scan 
likely is related to patient's known lung cancer.  Left lower 
lung field consolidation is better assessed on recent CT scan.  
Left pleural effusion is under seen on recent CT scan.  No 
pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Port-A-Cath with appropriate position.  Left lower lung 
consolidation is 
better assessed on recent CT scan. 

TRANSTHORACIC ECHO ___
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is normal. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal left
ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior 
walls. The visually estimated left
ventricular ejection fraction is 45%. There is no resting left 
ventricular outflow tract gradient. No
ventricular septal defect is seen. There is Grade I diastolic 
dysfunction. Normal right ventricular cavity size
with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is 
normal for gender with normal ascending aorta
diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a 
normal descending aorta diameter. There is no
evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild to moderate [___] mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. 
There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Inferior posterior 
hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of , the posterior 
wall is now hypokinetic (in addition to
the inferior wall which was and remains hypokinetic), but the 
suboptimal image quality of the studies
precludes definitive comparison.

CORONARY ANGIOGRAM WITH PCI ___
Findings
 Focal critical proximal LCx stenosis. Successful PCI of ostial 
LCx using single DES.
Recommendations
 ASA for life, clopidogrel x 28 days given high bleeding risk 
and enrollment into Xience 28 study if she is amenable.

SUMMARY STATEMENT:
====================
___ woman with history of HFpEF, hyperlipidemia, stage I 
lung adenocarcinoma with recurrence currently on pembrolizumab 
(last dose 1 week ago) who presents with 3 days of left-sided 
chest pain. She was found to have significant troponin 
elevation, coronary angiogram showed 95% proximal left 
circumflex lesion which was opened with drug-eluting stent on 
___. She was started on dual antiplatelet therapy, which she 
will likely continue for 28 days as part of a clinical trial 
after which she will be on aspirin for life. She was also 
treated for community acquired pneumonia, diagnosed based on a 
CT performed at outside hospital. She was discharged home on ___ 
after monitoring.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Day 1 of community-acquired pneumonia treatment course ___, 
patient discharged with 2 days of cefpodoxime which will be 
completed on ___.

[] New medications this admission include aspirin, atorvastatin, 
clopidogrel, lisinopril.

[] Repaglinide held on discharge due to concern for interaction 
with clopidogrel. Restart as outpatient with close monitoring if 
indicated.

[] Adrenal nodule seen on BID-N CT, will need follow-up by 
oncology providers on
transition.

[] Brother and HCP recently deceased, she says she has not 
filled out paperwork - would make sure HCP is filled out.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Type 1 NSTEMI
# Anginal chest pain
Patient presented with 3 days of left sided chest pain. At BID-N 
she had a CT which showed left lower lobe lung lesion consistent 
with known cancer and also concerning for possible pneumonia. 
She was also found to have troponin elevation there with normal 
CK-MB. Her troponin was 0.13-->0.19--> 0.38 -> 0.7 -> 0.6 at 
___. She was aspirin loaded and placed on heparin drip. Home 
pravastatin was switched to atorvastatin. She was continued on 
home beta blocker, fractionated. On ___ she underwent left heart 
cath with coronary angina which identified 95% lesion in the 
ostial left circumflex to which one drug-eluting stent was 
placed. She will require aspirin for life and clopidogrel daily 
for now.

# Community acquired pneumonia
CT acquired at outside hospital showed findings concerning for 
possible pneumonia. She was initiated on vancomycin and 
cefepime, it is unclear why this regimen was chosen as she does 
not seem to have a recent history of hospitalization. She did 
have her last dose of chemotherapy pembrolizumab within the last 
7 to 10 days at ___. This was continued here in the 
emergency department, on arrival to the medicine floor due to 
low suspicion for actual pneumonia (cough without fevers, no 
leukocytosis) and minimal risk factors, she was switched to 
community-acquired pneumonia coverage. She was initially on 
ceftriaxone (day one ___, azithromycin was held due to clinical 
improvement without atypical organism coverage. She was 
discharged on ___. She was given 2 additional days of 
cefpodoxime to complete her 5-day course.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Type 2 diabetes
Placed on SSI here, did not receive fixed insulin due to not 
knowing home dose. Held repaglinide (see transitional issues).

Microbiology:
 - ___ Urine Culture: yeast
 - ___ Blood Culture: no growth
 - multiple negative C diff studies

Imaging:
 - ___ Chest Xray: The endotracheal tube now terminates 4.5 
cm from the carina. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach. A 
right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There 
has been interval improvement in aeration bilaterally, right 
greater than left, but alveolar and interstitial opacities 
compatible with edema persist. Lung bases remain hyperinflated, 
with small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is unchanged. IMPRESSION: 1. Supporting devices as 
described. 2. Interval improvement in pulmonary edema, now 
moderate. 3. Unchanged small-to-moderate bilateral pleural 
effusions. 
 - ___ TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There 
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
near akinesis of the anterior septum and anterior wall. The 
lateral wall is mildly hypokinetic. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent 
with LAD ischemia/infarction. Calcified aortic valve without 
significant stenosis.  

___ CT Chest notable findings: 1. Bilateral upper lobe 
bronchovascular ground-glass infiltrates, this is most likely 
due to bilateral upper lobe pneumonia or aspiration, hemorrhage 
and pulmonary edema are considered less likely.  2. A renal 
ultrasound is suggested to evaluate possible left hydroureter. 

___ Renal Ultrasound notable findings: No evidence of 
hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or stones.  Previously seen left 
hydroureter has now resolved, possibly secondary to Foley 
placement in the bladder. 

___ CT Chest notable findings: 1. No intra-abdominal 
abscess. 2. Interval near-complete resolution of right pleural 
effusion. Interval increase of small-to-moderate on the left. 3. 
Normal aeration of the right lung without focal consolidations. 
4. Subtotal collapse of the left lower lobe with loculated 
pleural effusion.  Superimposed infectious process cannot be 
excluded. 5. Bilateral severe hydronephrosis extending to the 
UVJs but without definite obstructive mass. Could represent 
chronic reflux from a full bladder. 6. Tiny pockets of 
intravesicular air in the anti-dependent portion of the bladder. 
If the patient has no recent instrumentation, differential 
diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis must be considered. 7. A 1.3 
cm right hyperdense renal cyst, better characterized in the 
previous ultrasound study. 8. Tiny urinary bladder stones. 

___ Renal Ultrasound notable findings:Interval development 
of bilateral symmetric moderate hydronephrosis involving both 
kidneys. Foley catheter in the bladder outlet and likely not 
functioning properly. 

___ Portable chest X-ray: Cardiac size is normal. Collapse 
of the left lower lobe is stable. Mild left pleural effusion has 
minimally increased in amount. The right lung is clear with no 
pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ M with a medical history notable for COPD, 
congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, recent 
G-tube placement for failure to thrive, and recurrent urinary 
tract infections who was transferred from an outside hospital to 
the ___ ICU for urosepsis.

He initially was intubated and on pressors. He required 
treatment for urosepsis (OSH cultures grew ESBL E coli), COPD, 
health-care associated pneumonia (culture negative), and CHF 
with reduced LVEF. He eventually improved and was extubated on 
___. However, he required transfer back to the ICU for flash 
pulmonary edema a few days later.

He was eventually transferred back to the floor and treated for 
the above conditions. He continued to have episodes of 
hypotension and respiratory distress and was found to have a 
leukocytosis and suspected empyema. This was unable to be 
drained by thoracentesis and the patient declined additional 
invasive procedures. He stabilized but did not improve on 
broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other active issues during this time 
included frequent episodes of flash pulmonary edema, delirium, 
and anxiety. 

A family meeting was held and the patient and his wife expressed 
strong desires for him to return home. He decided to pursue 
hospice care for his many chronic medical conditions. Of note, 
the patient had recently been admitted to a SNF and had a G-tube 
placed for failure to thrive thought to be from mild dementia; 
at that time he was DNR/DNI per his wishes but his goals of care 
changed immediately prior to admission to ___.

Management of active issues at discharge are outlined below:
1. Respiratory distress
 - thought to be from both COPD and CHF
- patient unable to tolerate treatments for CHF as outlined 
below
 - COPD treated with Spiriva, Advair, prednisone 5mg, 
guaifenesin, and oxygen
 - as mentioned above, he was treated for a healthcare 
associated pneumonia and may have developed an empyema that 
could not be drained without aggressive treatment; he stabilized 
with long courses of meropenam and ciprofloxacin during the 
hospital stay and these were discontinued at discharge
 - despite aggressive treatment Mr. ___ still complained of 
air hunger at rest and was started on morphine for symptom 
control at discharge

2. Anxiety
 - Mr. ___ reported a history of anxiety and benefited from 
PRN Ativan during his hospital stay

3. Diarrhea and malnutrition
 - he had frequent, loose stools while on tube feeds; these did 
not improve with fiber
 - he had multiple negative C diff studies including a PCR study
 - he was discharged on prophylactic oral Vancomycin given his 
recent antibiotics

4. Congestive heart failure with reduced LVEF
 - patient unable to tolerate beta-blocker,  Ace-In, or 
diuretics due to hypotension; this was likely related to the 
suspected ongoing infection as outlined above

5. BPH with obstruction
 - relieved with a Foley and could not tolerate BPH therapies 
due to hypotension as mentioned above

6. Atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal: 
 - continued on amiodarone at discharge; no anticoagulation as 
not consistent with goals of care

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you.  You were admitted to 
___ in transfer from ___ for sepsis due to a severe 
urinary tract infection.  You were initially treated in the ICU. 
 Your infection was treated with antibiotics. In addition to the 
urinary tract infection you were found to have an infection in 
your lung that required prolonged antibiotics. You were also 
found to have difficulty passing urine, adversely affecting the 
kidneys.  You now require an Foley catheter.

We discussed that you were severely ill with little chance of 
full recovery given the extent of your illness and 
deconditioning.  Currently, your body has very little reserve. 
You and your family have decided that your goal is to go home 
and have your symptoms such as pain and shortness of breath 
treated at home.  Thus, home hospice care has been arranged for 
you.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you this visit. You were 
admitted to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and were 
having a heart attack. You were immediately taken to the cardiac 
catheterization lab where they identifified a blockage 
consistnet with the changes on your EKG which they thought to be 
the cause of your acute heart attack. This vessel is called the 
right coroanry artery. This artery was stented with a drug 
coated stent. At that time it was also confirmed by visualizing 
all of the arteries that feed the heart muscle that you have 
blockages in the other arteries of your heart. 

You have also been identified as having a blcokage in your right 
carotid artery.

Given these issues we are sending you home with tight medication 
control as detailed below and with a plan to discuss the most 
appropriate interventions for your coronary artery disease as 
well as your carotid blockage. 

You will start the following medications:
Aspirin 325mg daily
Plavix 75mg daily: this prevents clot from forming in the new 
area the stent was placed, DO NOT stop this medication unless 
specifically spoken to by Dr. ___.
Rosouvastatin 20mg daily: this is replacing the pravastatin for 
cholesterol management
Metorpolol 75mg XL daily: This is to decrease your heart rate 
and thereby the workload of the heart.
Nitroglycerin tablets: placed under the tongue and dissolve if 
you experience chest pain or shortness of breath this medicaiton 
acutely dilates the arteries that feed the heart muscle. You can 
take one every five minutes for a total of three and shoudl call 
___ if you do not experience relief. 

Additionally while you were in the hospital you received two 
large doses of contrast which can effect your kidneys. You 
should have started a drug called an ACE inhibitor as part of 
your recovery after your heart attack, but this can also cause 
some damage to vulnerable kidneys so we are holding this drug 
for now. This should be reconsidered once your labs are back to 
baseline and we know your kidney function is back to baseline. 
 
Followup Instructions:

 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 47-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She had a history of colon adenocarcinoma and had undergone a low anterior resection 7 months prior. She presented with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, which was similar to a previous small bowel obstruction (SBO) she experienced after her colectomy. 

The patient's past medical history includes breast cancer, cervical DDD, and depression. She has no known family history of breast or ovarian cancer, but her maternal grandmother had colon cancer. 

The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, and was found to have a strangulating small bowel obstruction. She was managed with IV fluids, medications, and a nasogastric tube, and was eventually able to tolerate a regular diet. 

The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of strangulating small bowel obstruction, and was prescribed medications including venlafaxine, famotidine, docusate sodium, and hydromorphone. She was advised to follow up with her doctor in 6 weeks and to avoid lifting heavy objects, driving, or operating heavy machinery while taking pain medications. ||endoftext||"

line placement and HD initiation, hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, HFpEF (EF 50-55%), severe AS, isolated IgA deficiency, 
and breast cancer s/p mastectomy who presented after a syncopal 
episode and fall with head strike.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Syncope 
# Severe aortic stenosis
# Fall with headstrike
Patient presented with syncope with preceding nausea/emesis and 
sinus pain. Hx of CAD s/p remote MI, however etiology unlikely 
to be ___ ischemia given no chest pain and ECG without e/o 
ischemia; trops 0.1 --> 0.09 with flat MB, likely in the setting 
of reduced renal clearance ___ ESRD. Orthostatics negative on 
admission. No evidence of seizure activity. CT head negative for 
intracranial bleeding and neuro exam without focal deficits. No 
respiratory symptoms, tachycardia, tachypnea, or risk factors to 
suggest PE. Differential for this patient includes reduced 
cerebral profusion iso severe AS (notably, ___ has decreased 
from 1.5 in ___ to 0.9 ___ vs orthostatic hypotension vs 
vasovagal episode vs. arrhythmia. Repeat orthostatic VS were 
negative on ___. At___ cardiology was consulted regarding 
potential TAVR given progression of AS with new syncope. The 
plan was to do HD first; as he tolerated HD well, the plan was 
to perform TAVR as an outpatient. Home bumex was held given that 
his blood pressures were borderline low and with planned 
treatment via HD. He was continued on metoprolol tartrate 12.5 
mg BID (home bisoprolol not on formulary) at ___. He was 
evaluated by dentistry and Panorex showed no evidence of gross 
caries, abscess, or infection. Lower extremity arterial duplex 
U/S and CT abdomen/pelvis w/o contrast were obtained as part of 
pre-TAVR work-up. He will be discharged to rehab with plan for 
outpatient TAVR. TAVR team to reach out to patient directly to 
setup appointment for follow-up whether patient still in rehab 
or as an outpatient.

Admission planned on ___ for placement of tunneled line and HD 
initiation. Nephrology will plan for future left upper arm graft 
for long-term access. He had tunneled line placed by ___ on ___ 
and tolerated four HD sessions. Quantiferon gold was negative 
for TB. Per renal recs, he was started on nephrocaps and 2L 
fluid restriction. 

# Left foot pain
Foot XR from OSH notable for possible avulsion fracture from 
talonavicular ligament. However, repeat foot XR here at ___ 
showed degenerative changes but no evidence of fracture. 
Discussed with orthopedics who recommended weight bearing as 
tolerated by patient. He received PRN Tylenol for pain control. 

# Chronic Sinusitis
Patient has nasal pain and postnasal drip. Saline nasal spray 
and fluticasone was used to control symptoms. He will follow-up 
with ENT for chronic sinusitis.

# Anemia
Hgb 8.5 on admission from 9.0 at OSH, and 9.4 on ___ 12.7 
in ___. Differential includes decreased production in setting 
of ESRD vs shearing from AS. Labs were not suggestive of 
hemolysis. Etiology likely related to ESRD. Plan for 
hemodialysis and possible initiation of EPO as outpatient per 
renal.

# Code status
Patient reports that he would like to be full code, but it would 
depend on his clinical situation for how long he would want to 
be coded. He expressed that if he were to be very ill, or in 
significant pain, he would want his daughters to decide. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
# HFpEF
TTE from ___ with EF 50-55% (improved from <30% on ___ 
exam), ___ AS, ___ MR, and elevated PA. Home bumetanide was 
held given HD initiation and soft BPs. He received metoprolol as 
above while inpatient. 

# Hypertension 
He was treated with metoprolol as above.

# IgA Deficiency
Gets IgA infusions, last infusion ___. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
============================================
-Last HD session: ___
 Medication changes:

pneumonia, pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not 
engorged.  The 
cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar 
contours are 
within normal limits. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low lung volumes 
and mild 
atelectasis. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Dr. ___ service.  Patient 
received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, PCA, IVF and 
placed NPO.  The patient had an NGT in place post-operatively, 
and  KUB was performed to confirm placement.  While NPO, he 
reamined on IVFs to keep UOP 1 cc/kg/hour.  On POD1 the NGT was 
maintained, and he was encouraged to get OOB.  He was also found 
to be tachycardic to 110-120s  with stable pressures and no 
fevers.  An EKG, CXR, and cardiac enzyme rule out were negative 
for any acute processes.  He was placed on telemetry and IV 
metoprolol,  was found to be overall fluid positive, and 
responded well to gentle diuresis and minimalizing fluid intake. 
 On POD 2, the NGT was removed.  On POD 3 he was then started on 
strict sips after ensuring no nausea, soft abdomen and normal 
bowel sounds.  All home meds were restarted.  His diet was 
advanced on POD 4.  He received one dose of unasyn, and his 
nephrostomy tube was clamped.  On POD 5 he was transitioned from 
PCA to po pain meds. He recieved another dose of unasyn and the 
PCN was removed without difficulty.  He was transitioned off of 
IV metopropol and his vitals were stable.  The ostomy nurse saw 
the patient for ostomy teaching.  At the time of discharge the 
wound was healing well with no evidence of erythema, swelling, 
or purulent drainage.  The ostomy was perfused and patent.  On 
POD 6, the JP fluid was sent for creatinine, which was 
consistent with serous fluid, and removed without difficulty.  
He was discharged home with pain controlled on oral medications, 
ambulating without difficulty, producing adequate UOP, 
tolerating a regular diet, and underwent ostomy care teaching.  
He was discharged home with nursing home services. The ostomy 
had ___ feeding tubes protruding from it as ureteral stents, 
which would fall out on their own in ___ days.

melena in the vault. Later she had a BM (1 tsp of mahogony 
stool). GI was consulted. PIV 18g x 2 were placed. Before the pt 
was transfered to the floor she had rigors and a temp of 102. 
Then pt had brownish red emesis that was positive for blood, 
~150ml. NGT was placed and pt was lavaged with 1000ml. At first 
the output was frothy and ___ brown, later became green. 
Blood cx were drawn. Pt was given Pantoprazole 40 mg, 
Acetaminophen 650mg PR,  Lidocaine Jelly 2% 5mL, Ondansetron 
2mg/mL-2mL, MetRONIDAZOLE (FLagyl) 500mg. Also given 2 liters 
NS. KUB showed no free air. GI requested MICU admission for 
scope. VS on transfer were HR 86 115/68 18 98%RA with NGT and 
repeat hct was 35. 
.
On the floor, pt is a poor historian, but is feeling well. She 
c/o a gagging sensation from her NGT. No pain, SOB, or other 
complaints.

___:
Tagged RBC scan:
1. No definite evidence of active GI bleed at this time. In case 
of 
continued clinical concern a repeat study in about 48 hours can 
be obtained. 2. Intense uptake in the left upper quadrant is 
likely due to stomach uptake of free pertechnetate. 
Visualization of the thyroid gland compatible with free 
pertechnetate contaminating the tracer. 3. Left thyroid nodule. 
Thyroid ultrasound is suggested for further evaluation. 
.
___ EGD:
Large amount of clot found in the stomach and at the anastomotic 
site of the efferent limb. The overlying clot was washed away 
with water flushes. There was an area of mucosa noted in this 
area with an ulceration with an area of adherent clot. This clot 
was not able to be washed away with flushes. Question the 
possibility of an underlying bleeding vessel. A clip was noted 
from a prior upper endoscopy. Four additional clips were placed 
with success. No active bleeding was noted.
Blood in the stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to stomach 
Recommendations: Follow hematocrit closely. Continue PPI BID.

anastomosis 
Recommendations: Continue inhospital monitoring 
.
___ EGD:
Prior cratered ulcer was seen at the anastomotic site. Three 
visible vessels were seen within the cratered ulcer. One clip 
was placed on the larger visible vessel (near the junction of 
the afferent and efferent limb). Once the clip was placed, this 
area began to ooze. An additional clip was placed and then BICAP 
thermal therapy was applied with successful hemostasis.

(Bilroth II) in ___ p/w recent recurrent upper GI bleed now 
transfered from OSH for recurrent bleeding, admitted to ICU 
after having hematemesis and a fever, then transferred to the 
floor.
.
# Upper GI bleed: Pt has a hx of a gastric cancer s/p resection 
and now has had recurrent bleeds over last week at her 
anastomsis site and is s/p a clipping of a gastroduodenal 
branch. She was initially admitted to the MICU where she 
received one unit pRBC, however as NG lavage was negative and 
she remained hemodynamically stable she was quickly transferred 
to the general medical floor. GI, surgery and ___ were consulted. 
 followed the patient while in-house and given negative repeat 
nasogastric lavage, patient was transferred to the floor. Prior 
to EGD/Colonoscopy, patient was continued on Sucralfate, 
protonix BID IV with every ___ hour hematocrits. Patient had 
EGD/colonoscopy on ___. On ___ patient felt lightheaded and saw 
double vision, in the setting of hemodynamic stability, and Hct 
had dropped ___ points. 2 units blood transfused, and hct bumped 
appropriately. The next morning, repeat EGD performed that 
showed evidence of old bleed, but no active bleed. That same 
day, tagged RBC scan performed to attempt to localize source of 
bleeding, but did not show any definite GI bleed.  Patient next 
had a repeat EGD on ___ in which further clipping was done (see 
results section). 
After that final procedure, patient's Hct was serially checked 
and remained stable. Her diet was advanced and well tolerated. 
PPI changed to PO. Sucralfate continued. Patient was ambulating 
and was notably pain-free throughout her entire time on the 
hospital floor. Serology was positive for H.pylori and the 
patient was started on quadruple therapy for ___elieve the anastamosis site s/p gastric cancer resection was 
vulnerable to ulceration/bleed, and in the setting of H.pylori 
infection resulted in further ulceration and hence the bleed. 
Follow up with GI was arranged prior to discharge.
.
# Fever: UA was positive therefore she was treated with 
Ciprofloxacin.  Urine culture did then grow two species 
infection. Treated for e.coli and beta strep in her urine 
(asymptomatic), with an antibiotic course. Afebrile afterwards, 
without leukocytosis, without dysuria.
.
# Renal failure: Creatinine on admission to OSH was 1.6 --> 1.3 
on admission to ___ but responded to 4 liters total of normal 
saline and one unit pRBC to 1.2. Continued hydration, in setting 
of NPO and bleed, again brought Cr down lower. On discharge, Cr 
was stable and patient was without dysuria and was hydrating on 
her own through PO.
.
# HTN: Blood pressures were mildly elevated in the setting of 
holding her home amlodipine and lisinopril given the recent GI 
bleed. These were continued to be held in the setting of bleed. 
Beta-blocker started to help reduce patient's pre-op risk, in 
case had to urgently go to surgery. Once GI bleed issue resolved 
and Hct's were stable, stopped beta-blocker and restarted 
patient's home anti-hypertensive regimen.
.
# Memory impariment / Presumed dementia: Patient is a very poor 
historian and has little short term memmory. Unclear if she 
officially has a dx of dementia, but appears to on exam. Patient 
was monitored closely for delirium, re-oriented frequently and 
tubes/drains were minimized when possible. Without issues during 
this hospitalization.  Requires outpatient follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hosptial with blood in your stool. Your 
blood levels were monitored and you were rehydrated. You 
continued to have blood in your stool, the gastrointestinal team 
and the surgical team were consulted regarding your care. With 
multiple imaging studies by the gastrointestinal team to looks 
at your esophagus, stomach, and intestines, they saw evidence of 
bleeding at the stomach, near the site of your prior surgery 
where there was bleeding & an ulcer. You were transfused blood 
and IV fluids, and you had clips placed at the bleeding site. 
After the clips were appropriately placed, your blood counts 
were closely monitored and they remained stable for multiple 
days. We believe the bleeding had to do with a bacteria in your 
stomach as well as it being a complication at your prior 
surgical site where there was a bleeding ulcer. Your diet was 
advanced to regular and you were tolerating that well; you were 
also feeling well and walking well. You had stopped bleeding, 
and on discharge your blood levels were stable.
.
You had a fever that resolved. You were found to have a urinary 
tract infection, and were treated with a course of antibiotics.
.
You spent a night in the ICU and then were on the regular 
hospital floor.
.
Changes to your medications include:
- START Metonidazole four times a day for 2 weeks
- START Bismuth four times a day for 2 weeks
- START Tetracycline four times a day for 2 weeks
- START Pantoprazole twice a day
- START Sucralfate four times a day
- START Senna daily, as needed for constipation
- CONTINUE your other home medications
.
Please see your primary care physician this ___ and have her 
check your blood level to make sure that it is stable. On 
discharge from the hospital today (___), your Hematocrit 
level was 34.1).
.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospial if you develop 
vomiting with blood, bloody stool, lightheadedness, shortness of 
breath, chest pain, or other symptoms that concern you or your 
family.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ presented with a complex history of fistulizing 
ileocolonic Crohn's disease since ___ and now a colocutaneous 
fistula/abscess. At this of her admission it was clear that her 
penetrating Crohn's disease had not been responding to Stelara 
and her steroid dependence was potentially predisposing to 
fistula/abscess formation. 

In this current setting both Gastroenterology and Colorectal 
surgery determined that there were limited medical options to 
attempt to induce remission of her disease. It was recommended 
that she receive total parenteral nutrition or enteral feeding- 
although she initially declined, she eventually consented to a 
PICC being placed so that she could receive TPN. TPN was 
continued throughout this admission and by the time of 
discharge, it was being cycled over 12hours and this was 
tolerated well. 

CT taken on ___ was indicative of an active Crohn's flare; MRE 
was also obtained and demnstrated extensive acute on chronic 
inflammation involving multiple loops of small bowel and large 
bowel. Of particular note, on CT there was an area surrounding 
the eleventh rib concerning for osteomyelitis. She underwent MRI 
of chest to further characterise this. It demonstrated a 
10x1.7x6.8cm abscess centered at the left thoracolumbar junction 
tracking along the left chest wall and extending inferiorly to 
the level of iliac bone in the setting of a colocutaneous 
fistula.As a result infectious disease recommended daily 
ertapenem infusions (1g daily for 7 days until surgery).  She is 
planned for an OR procedure on ___ for multiple resections to 
get control of her fistulizing disease and possible ostomy 
creation; the area surround the 11th rib will also be cultured.

___ URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH.

IMAGING:  

___ CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Since ___, a left PICC has been placed, terminating in 
the lower superior vena cava adjacent to the junction with the 
right atrium.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for new patchy 
bibasilar opacities which may reflect patchy atelectasis, 
aspiration, or early infection.  Small bilateral pleural 
effusions are also demonstrated.

___ MRI WBC tracer:
FINDINGS:  There is very faintly increased radiotracer uptake in 
the region of the right ankle and foot.  A paucity of ""counts"" 
makes precize localization of radiotracer very difficult but it 
is suspected that activity is most likely in the superficial 
soft tissues rather than the bone.  Further evaluation with 
contrast-enhanced MRI or 3 phase bone scan could be considered 
and may be more specific.

ECHO ___:
IMPRESSION: No clear evidence of endocarditis seen. Mild LV 
cavity dilation with low normal LV systolic function by 3D LVEF 
quantification. Visually LV function appears normal. Type II 
diastolic dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary systolic arterial 
hypertension.
 If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D 
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
LV systolic function (50-55%) appears slightly less vigorous 
today and LV appears larger.  

ABIs ___:
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of arterial insufficiency to the lower extremities 
at rest.  Noncompressible arteries in the left suggest dense 
atherosclerotic calcification. 

Renal US ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Inadequate sonographic evaluation due to body habitus and 
overlying bowel gas.  No obvious hydro, masses or stones 
bilaterally.  The bladder is not distended but normal in 
appearance without obvious mass. 
2. Trace ascites. 

CXR ___:
Slight increase in size of small bilateral pleural effusions. 
Since ___.  Adjacent dependent bibasilar opacities
could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or infectious pneumonia. 

___ Ankle   
IMPRESSION:  
No soft tissue gas. No significant change since prior.

___ Foot
IMPRESSION: 
No definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis.  Ulceration 
plantar to the calcaneus.  Unchanged appearance of the hardware. 
 Neuropathic changes within the midfoot, as seen previously.

___:  chest x-ray:

No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged 
and there is opacification centrally consistent with elevated 
pulmonary venous pressure.  Left subclavian PICC line extends to 
the upper right atrium.  It could be pulled back approximately 2 
cm if the desired position is at or above the cavo-atrial 
junction. 

___:  chest x-ray:

Lung volumes remain exceedingly low.  Left basal consolidation 
has improved, right basal consolidation has worsened, suggesting 
pneumonia.  Heart size normal.  Pulmonary vasculature engorged, 
no definite edema or appreciable pleural effusion 

___:  CT of the chest:

The nondependent multifocal consolidations in the right and left 
lung show a distribution and contrast enhancement pattern highly 
suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.  The distribution and 
location of the lesions is not typical for septic emboli.  Small 
bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left, extensive 
bilateral dependent areas of atelectasis. 

___:  cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

1. Large debridement with packing in the anterior abdominal wall 
and perineum with small locule of gas posterior to the area of 
debridement in the perineum adjacent to the left gluteal cleft. 
Unclear if this reflects postsurgical change or infection. 
2. Very distended bladder despite a Foley catheter. 
3. For details regarding the chest including bilateral 
consolidations, please see dedicated chest CT report 

___:  chest x-ray:

Moderate pulmonary edema has increased, and bibasilar 
consolidation, 
particularly on the right, has worsened since ___, 
pneumonia until 
proved otherwise.  Bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, not 
large but 
still possibly considerable in size. 
  
ET tube, feeding tube, left PIC line, esophageal drainage tube, 
are all in 
standard placements 

___: chest x-ray:

Pulmonary edema, though bilateral pneumonia may be considered in 
right 
clinical context 

___:  chest x-ray:

Progressed nodular opacities, concerning for worsening edema 
and/or pneumonia.

___:  chest x-ray:

RECOMMENDATION(S):  Multi focal pneumonia has worsened since 
___, not appreciably changed since ___.  Patient was 
in mild pulmonary edema on ___ which improved by ___ 
and is probably recurred.  Heart is mildly enlarged but 
unchanged.  Pleural effusions are presumed but not large. 
With the chin down, the tip of the endotracheal tube less than 3 
cm from the carina is acceptable.  Left PIC line and right 
jugular line both end low in the SVC close to the superior 
cavoatrial junction.  Feeding tube ends in the stomach.  
Esophageal drainage tube can be traced only as far as the low 
esophagus.  The tip is obscured. 
There is no pneumothorax. 

___:  chest x-ray:

Large areas of consolidation in both lungs due to multi focal 
pneumonia have probably improved on the right, but worsened in 
the left lower lobe over the past 48 hr. The disseminated 
infiltrative abnormality in the left lung is less heterogeneous 
on this radiograph, but I cannot tell whether that means its 
improving or obscured by concurrent edema.  Heart is borderline 
enlarged but unchanged.  Paragraph ET tube and right internal 
jugular line are in standard placements.  Left PIC line ends 
close to the superior cavo-atrial junction.  Feeding tube and 
esophageal drainage tube both into the stomach.  No 
pneumothorax.  Substantial pleural effusions are presumed and 
may be increasing on the left. 
  

  

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with PMH of poorly controlled 
diabetes transferred from OSH with necrotizing soft tissue 
infection of the perineum/abdominal wall. She underwent multiple 
washout and debridements. Please see the operative reports for 
details. Her hospital course has also been complicated by 
aspiration event ___ w/ mild ARDS, now much improved from a 
respiratory standpoint, extubated. Plastic Surgery has been 
consulted for reconstructive planning. Infectious disease also 
followed the patient and provided recommendations throughout the 
ICU stay.

ICU Course:
Neurologic: Pain control initially with fentanyl gtt, and 
sedation required while intubated. Pain control with Tylenol and 
dilaudid PRN prior to transfer to floor. 
 
Cardiovascular: Initially required multiple pressors for blood 
pressure support. As necrotizing soft tissue infection under 
more control, pressor requirement decreased to the point of no 
longer being required. Patient received IVF crystalloid in 
initial sepsis fluid resuscitation. Albumin boluses were given 
on later in ICU course PRN. 

Pulmonary: Patient developed ARDS and was placed on ARDS 
protocol. She was extubated on ___ (intubated ___. By the 
time of floor transfer, her oxygen requirement continued to 
decrease on NC. ABGs were obtained routinely while intubated for 
assessment. Once extubated, the patient used incentive 
spirometry and got OOB to chair. 
  
GI/Abdomen: The patient was initially NPO with OGT while 
intubated. TF were given via dobhoff (replaced ___. Famotidine 
ppx was given and restarted for heartburn. She was maintained on 
a bowel regimen. She had a rectal tube to keep stool away from 
perineal wound. 

Nutrition: NPO with Glucerna TF via dobhoff.

Renal: Baseline renal function: Cr 0.6 on admission. Patient was 
initially fluid resuscitated. Required IVF for large amounts of 
insensible losses from abdominal drainage, now better quantified 
with make shift wound vac (ioban, moist to dry kerlex, 2x tubes 
to continueous wall suction). By time of transfer to floor, 
fluid balance goal even-negative. Patient received daily 
weights. After initial volume resuscitation, patient was given 
PRN 5% albumin boluses.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F DM type I and recurrent gastroparesis who 
was recently discharged w/ DKA who now presents with abdominal 
pain, N/V/D x1 day, and DKA due to poor po intake and insulin 
noncompliance prompting admission to ICU for DKA mgmt and 
insulin drip.

# DKA: Was admitted in ___ for DKA. DKA attributed to 
poor PO intake, interruption of TF and interruption of insulin 
dosing.  ___ be component of gastroenteritis, although may be 
difficult to distinguish from gastroparesis. Presented w/ anion 
gap of 21 which closed while in ED. Given glargine 18u in ED. 
Insulin gtt initially 0.5-2u/hr. Started jejunal TF nocturnally 
(home regimen). ___ endocrinology thought home regular 
insulin regimen should remain unchanged. Her gap closed while in 
the ICU, and she was called out on her home insulin regimen. 
While on the floor, her sugars were generally well-controlled; 
however, she did have episodes of hypoglycemia. This was 
attributed to her stopping her TF's earlier than scheduled. To 
try to prevent hypoglycemia at home, her Lantus evening dose was 
decreased slightly. She was also instructed to lower her sliding 
scale insulin when not getting tube feeds. She was also 
instructed to make sure she has some source of glucose intake 
every day even if she does not feel well.

# Diabetes Mellitus, Type I: Diagnosed in ___, complicated by 
retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, gastroparesis. Poorly 
controlled since this is her second episode of DKA in past 
month. Last HbgA1c 7.3% on ___. Not on ACEI because of 
hyperkalemia per outpatient ___ nephrologist notes.

# Leukocytosis: ___ 14 on admission w/ 88% PMNs and no bands. No 
fevers. U/A neg. Having diarrhea on admission and was reportedly 
successfully treated for CDiff w/ po Flagyl 2 weeks prior to 
admission. Repeat C diff was negative. WBC resolved with 
treatment of DKA, so leukocytosis was likely related to DKA, a 
known precipitant.

# Abdominal pain: Likely due to her known gastroparesis. 
Improved significantly in ED w/ hydration and closure of 
anion-gap. C diff was negative. She required heavy use of 
antiemetics (ativan and ondansetron) and eventually improved. 
Tube feeds via jejunostomy were continued because these should 
not contribute to her nausea as they are post-pyloric.

# Gastroparesis: Of note, her GJ was replaced by ___ on ___. 
See above.

# ___ on CKD: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.6. Cr on admission 2.0, likely 
hypovolemic/prerenal in setting of vomiting and poor po. Trended 
down to 1.6 by ___. She was treated with IVF. 

# Hypertension: Difficult to control per last discharge summary. 
Continued home amlodipine and home carvedilol. She had some 
elevated BP's on the floor; however, she reported that her BP is 
always better once she is discharge. SBP's were in the 160's at 
the time of discharge.

# Hyperlipidemia: continued home Rosuvastatin 

# Anemia: Previously documented as multifactorial from CKD and  
malnutrition. No longer receives Aranesp weekly in ___ clinic 
per patient. Stable hematocrit while in house.

# Depression: Home fluoxetine

# Rheumatoid arthritis: Continued on Arava at discharge.

# GERD: Home omeprazole was clogging tube. Switch to 
lansoprazole. She was given an Rx for this at discharge.

Cardiomegaly is severe. Heterogeneous opacification throughout 
both lungs, 
accompanied by right pleural effusion is most easily explained 
by pulmonary edema, but other possibilities abound such as drug 
reaction, hemorrhage, or multifocal pneumonia. 
  
The transvenous right atrial pacer lead terminates more medial 
than the 
expected location of the normal right atrial appendage. It could 
be in a 
gigantic right atrium or running through the tricuspid valve 
toward the 
pulmonary outflow tract of the right ventricle. No pneumothorax. 


___ Chest xray

Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. Left 
transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard position. Pulmonary 
edema has improved, now is mild.  
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There are no 
new lung 
abnormalities. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ under the Acute Care Surgery 
Service for management of his RLE hematoma. He was taken to the 
operating room overnight and underwent incision and drainage of 
hematoma with debridement of skin, muscle, and fascia. He 
tolerated the procedure well and was extubated upon completion 
and taken to the PACU for recovery.

Postoperatively, he was transferred to the surgical floor. His 
vital signs were routinely monitored. He remained afebrile with 
a stable heart rate and BP. However, in the evening of POD 0 his 
oxygen saturation was noted to drop into the high 70's on room 
air and he had objective increased work of breathing. A chest 
xray was obtained which showed pulmonary edema and small 
bilateral pleural effusions. The patient was restarted on his 
home dose of Lasix, which had been held initially 
postoperatively for a borderline systolic BP in the 90's. His 
systolic BP remained stable in the 90's-100's with the Lasix. On 
POD1 he continued to have increased work of breathing with 
audible wheezing and inability to wean off supplemental O2 with 
O2 sats in the mid 80's on room air. A repeat chest xray was 
obtained at that time which showed improvement in pulmonary 
edema and stable small bilateral pleural effusions. At the time 
of discharge his O2 sats remained stable in the high 90's on 1.5 
L NC with decreased evidence of pulmonary edema. His oxygen was 
successfully weaned off prior to discharge.

Plastic surgery was consulted for the RLE wound postoperatively, 
who recommended wet to dry dressing changes BID, elevation of 
the RLE, and discussed the possibility of performing a skin 
graft. He will follow up as an outpatient in Plastics clinic for 
further discussions regarding skin grafting.

Physical therapy was consulted as it was noted that the patients 
mobility status had declined since being admitted to the 
hospital. He is being recommended for rehab after his acute 
hospital stay.

TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. 
Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard protocol. 
Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA. Postoperative HCT 
was stable. A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at the 
time of the posterior surgery remained in place until postop 
check when it was removed post-op day one. He was kept NPO until 
bowel function returned then diet was advanced as tolerated. The 
patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating 
PO diet. He was fitted with a lumbar warm-n-form brace for 
comfort. Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to 
ambulate. Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day 
of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, 
comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.

STUDIES: 
=======================
___ FEMUR (AP & LAT) RIGHT
FINDINGS:    
The patient is status post prophylactic fixation of a lytic 
lesion in the 
proximal right femur.  There is abnormal lucency seen in the 
lateral cortex of the right femur consistent with the patient's 
known metastatic ovarian cancer. 
This lesion is transfixed by a gamma nail construct.  No 
evidence of 
periprosthetic loosening.  No fracture seen.  Subcutaneous air 
is consistent with the recent surgery.  Moderate degenerative 
changes in the right knee. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Expected appearances following prophylactic fixation of a lytic 
lesion in the proximal femur. 

___ LOWER EXTREMITY FLUORO 
FINDINGS:  
Images demonstrate steps related to intramedullary nailing of 
the right femur 
with interlocking screws distally and cephalic screw proximally. 
 Hardware 
alignment is within expected limits.  See operative report for 
further 
details. 

___ Imaging BONE SCAN: 
1. Increased uptake within L2 and L3, as well as in the right
proximal femoral shaft, are consistent with known metastatic 
disease.
2. Previously described lesion within L5 does not demonstrate 
increased
uptake.
3. Faint uptake in the mid thoracic spine may represent an 
additional site of
disease, versus degenerative change. Recommend attention on 
followup. 
 
MR PELVIS W&W/O CONTRAST ___:
1. Large enhancing lesion in the proximal right femoral shaft, 
with cortical
destruction and overlying soft tissue signal abnormality which 
may reflect
reactive change or soft tissue extension of lesion, highly 
likely to represent
bone metastasis in this clinical scenario.
2. There is an additional incompletely imaged lesion in L3 which 
is also
suspicious for metastasis.
3. There is a small focal area of fusiform abnormal enhancement 
in the right
gluteal musculature lateral to the iliac crest which is 
nonspecific but is
also concerning for metastasis.
Recommendation:  Orthopedic consultation concerning risk for 
pathologic
fracture.
 
+ Pelvic x-ray ___:
IMPRESSION:   No acute fracture or dislocation seen.  No 
concerning osteoblastic or lytic lesion identified, however, if 
concern persists, MRI is more sensitive and should be 
considered. 

+ CT abd/pelvis ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Progression of metastatic disease with enlarging now necrotic 

retroperitoneal lymph nodes. 
2. Two new hypodense liver lesions are highly concerning for 
metastases. 
3. Lytic lesion of the L3 vertebral body, new from prior, 
concerning for osseous metastatic lesion, no pathologic 
fracture. Sclerotic T11 lesion is unchanged. 
4. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic pathology. 

+ MRI L-spine ___:
1. Enhancing lesions in the L2, L3 and L5 vertebral bodies 
consistent with osseous metastasis.  The largest lesion is 
located in the L3 vertebral body measuring up to 2.5 x 2.2 cm 
corresponding to lytic lesions as seen on CT.  There partial 
visualization of an adjacent retroperitoneal mass which appears 
to encase the abdominal aorta on the same-day CT exam with 
extension to the anterior endplates of L2 on L3, likely 
representing direct invasion into vertebral bodies at these 
levels.  No epidural involvement. 
2. No pathologic fracture. 
3. T1 and T2 hyperintense lesions in the T11 and L2 vertebral 
body most likely represent vertebral body hemangiomas. 
4. Multilevel degenerative changes, as above with a moderate 
spinal canal stenosis from L3 through S1 and moderate right 
L4-L5 neural foraminal  narrowing. 
5. Irregular 1.3 cm T2 hyperintense lesion in hepatic segment VI 
is suspicious for hepatic metastasis, as noted on prior CT. 
6. Renal cysts. 
 
MICRO:
Urine cultures x4 with mixed flora consistent with fecal 
contamination.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of BRCA1+, 
stage IV ovarian carcinoma s/p 7 cycles of ___ with 
recurrence now on C2D3 Bevacizumab and Doxorubicin who presented 
to the ED with 3 weeks of worsening right lower quadrant and 
right hip and pain leg. 

# Right hip/leg pain: during this admission, patient had right 
hip and leg pain from R proximal femur met due to progressive 
metastatic disease. However, patient had a sciatic pain 
component w/ L4-L5 neural foraminal narrowing corresponding with 
her L4 radiculopathy, as well as notable spinal stenosis from 
L3-S1 and lytic L2, L3 and L5 metastases. Patients pain improved 
improved after titration of oxycontin, now s/p intramedullary 
nail fixation of the R femur on ___ with oath. Patient was 
discharged on oxycontin 20mg QAM, 20MG at 4:00pm, 30MG QPM, as 
well as prn HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 4 mg PO Q4H:PRN Pain - 
Moderate. She was also discharged on Gabapentin 300 mg PO QHS, 
and Lidoderm 5% patch. Patient was further discharged with a 
TLSO brace. At the time of discharge, patient had well 
controlled pain at rest, and increased pain with standing 
however this pain was controlled. Plan to continue with XRT for 
proximal femur met pain, with ___ planning session scheduled for 
___. 

# Stage IV ovarian carcinoma: with recurrence after 7 cycles of 
first line chemotherapy, recently on bevacizumab/Doxorubicin. 
During this admission, discussion continued with primary 
oncologist Dr. ___ regarding progression on 
bevacizumab/doxirubicin. Patient met with palliative care as an 
inpatient. At the time of discharge, plan was made for patient 
to have outpatient with DFCI per patients request.

She has a history of type 1 diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), hypertension, and iron deficiency anemia. She was admitted with a fever of 104 and a left toe ulcer, which had been worsening over two weeks. Imaging studies showed vascular calcifications and minimal loss of cortical detail at the level of the terminal tuft of the third toe, which may reflect a component of osteomyelitis. The patient underwent toe amputation and was diagnosed with osteomyelitis. She was treated with antibiotics and discharged on a 6-week course of oral antibiotics.

The patient has allergies to lisinopril and has a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, with an A1C level of 11. She also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III. Her social history is significant for a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's physical examination revealed a regular pulse and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and clear lungs. Her abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended, and her extremities showed no edema. Her neurological examination was normal.

The patient was discharged on a regimen of antibiotics, vitamin D supplements, and sevelamer to control her hyperphosphatemia. She was also advised to follow up with her primary care physician and to monitor her laboratory results. ||endoftext||"

FINDINGS: 
There is about 7 x 6 mm area of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage 
overlying the middle frontal gyrus of the left frontal lobe 
(series 2, image 19), unchanged compared to the outside hospital 
from earlier today. There is an additional equivocal small focus 
of likely subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the post-central 
gyrus of the left anterior parietal lobe (series 2, image 19), 
less conspicuous than on the outside hospital CT scan. No 
additional foci of intracranial hemorrhage are visualized.  
  
No evidence of edema, mass effect or large acute territorial 
infarction.  
Incidental note is made of bilateral basal ganglia 
calcifications. The 
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There 
is an 
aggressive-appearing, lytic lesion in the orbital part of the 
right 
sphenoid/frontal bone(series 3, image 23), concerning for 
metastases in this patient with known lung cancer.  There is 
soft tissue swelling overlying the frontal process of the right 
zygomatic bone (series 2, image 8). No evidence of fractures. 
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear and well 
aerated.   
IMPRESSION:

1. Unchanged small left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No 
increase in 
subarachnoid hemorrhage.   
2. Lytic lesion in the lateral portion of the roof of the right 
orbit 
concerning for metastases, unchanged. 
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 10:15 ___ 

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to ___:   
Lower aspect of the right lateral chest is excluded from the 
examination. In the left lung, one can see vascular congestion. 
On the right, there may be lower lobe or middle lobe collapse 
and moderate right effusion. Heart is top normal size. Thoracic 
aorta is very tortuous but not dilated. No 
pneumothorax. When feasible, I would recommend carefully 
positioned upright chest radiograph, even if conventional views 
are not possible. 
.
CT TORSO W/CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 9:38 AM 
CT OF THE CHEST: There are numerous pathologically enlarged 
mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.  For example, a pretracheal 
node measures 14.7 mm in short axis (3:19). An azygos node 
measures 25.9 mm (3:26). A subcarinal node measures 22.7 mm 
(3:32). The right main bronchus is nearly obliterated by 
extensive lymphadenopathy and possibly an adjacent mass. There 
is substantial volume loss due to post obstructive changes 
involving the right lower and middle lobes. A central hypodense 
component with cavitations is noted within the collapsed lung 
region (3:34), which may represent a cavitating mass or 
infection in post obstrutive lung. There is a moderate pleural 
effusion, measuring 30 Hounsfield units on pre-contrast images, 
suggestive of a possible hemorrhagic component. There are 
diffuse bilateral areas of ground-glass opacities involving 
predominantly lower left lung and the right lung, which may be 
infectious, inflammatory nature, or metastasis. The heart is 
mildly enlarged with small pericardial effusion. There are 
extensive coronary vascular calcifications. The intrathoracic 
aorta is notable for calcified atherosclerotic disease without 
aneurysmal changes.  Otherwise, great vessels are unremarkable. 
There are no pathologically enlarged axillary or supraclavicular 
nodes.  
CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  
The liver is of homogeneous attenuation without focal masses. 
There is a 
calcified focus within the right lobe of the liver, which may be 
due to old trauma or related to prior granulomatous disease. 
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary 
ductal dilatation. The hepatic 
vasculature is widely patent. There are multiple gallstones 
within the 
gallbladder without associated inflammatory changes. The spleen 
appears 
unremarkable. The pancreas enhances homogeneously without ductal 
dilatation.  The right adrenal gland appears normal. The left 
adrenal gland is enlarged with attenuation of 35 Hounsfield 
units on pre-contrast images, concerning for a metastatic focus. 
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without 
evidence of hydronephrosis or renal masses. There are several 
hypodense lesions within the left kidney, which are too small to 
characterize and most likely represent cysts. There are no 
pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph 
nodes. There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen. 
The 
intra-abdominal aorta and its branches are notable for extensive 
calcified 
atherosclerotic disease without aneurysmal changes.   
The small and large bowel are normal in caliber without evidence 
of 
obstruction. 
  
CT OF THE PELVIS: 
The bladder, distal ureters, prostate, and rectum appear 
unremarkable. The 
Foley catheter is in place. There are scattered diverticula 
within the 
sigmoid colon without associated inflammatory changes. There is 
no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.   
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are numerous destructive lesions 
involving both 
appendicular and axial skeleton. There are multiple destructive 
lesions 
involving bilateral ribs, the largest lesion involves the 
posterior right 11th rib. There are lytic lesions involving the 
right scapula and pelvic bones, easpecially the right acetabulum 
with cortical breakthrough. Vertebrae may also have lucent/lytic 
lesions.   
IMPRESSION:   
1. Extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. No distinct 
pulmonary 
masses identified. There is near obliteration of the right main 
bronchus with post-obstructive changes involving the right lower 
and middle lobes. There is a central hypodense component and 
cavitation of the right lower lung, which may represent a mass.  
 
2. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, which may be 
infectious, 
inflammatory in nature, and metastasis cannot be excluded.   
3. Moderate right pleural effusion.   
4. Mildly enlarged heart with small pericardial effusion.   
5. Extensive lytic lesions involving both axial and appendicular 
skeleton, 
c/w metastatic lesions.   
6. Enlarged left adrenal gland concerning for metastatic focus.  
 
7. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.  

CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 3:23 ___ 
FINDINGS: The previously suggested region of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage is not identified overlying the middle frontal gyrus 
on the current film. There is interval increase in size of a 
left subdural hygroma compared to ___ that is causing mild 
mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere. There are no other 
areas of extra- or intra-parenchymal hemorrhage noted. There are 
no obvious masses noted to suggest metastatic disease to the 
brain. No evidence of edema, mass effect or large acute 
territorial infarction.  Again seen is an aggressive lytic 
lesion (2, 13) that is unchanged compared to prior exam. The 
visible paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are all well 
aerated.   
IMPRESSION: 
1. Mildly enlarged right sided subdural hygroma with mild mass 
effect of 
right hemisphere. 
2. No evidence of subarachnoid or intraparenchymal bleed 
3. Unchanged lytic lesion in the lateral portion of the roof of 
the right 
orbit suggestive of osseous metastatic disease. 
4. These findings reported to Dr. ___ at 5:30 ___ ___. 
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 4:04 ___ 
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: As seen on recent CT 
examination, 
there is a right orbital roof lesion measuring 3.1 x 2.0 cm 
(801B:46). This demonstrates enhancement and osseous 
destruction; the latter was better appreciated by CT technique. 
An additional tiny focus of enhancement in the left frontal 
cortex correlates with a gyrus involved in recent contusion and 
thus is likely post-traumatic. No other concerning enhancing 
lesion is seen.  The size of a left subdural collection is not 
increased since most recent comparison. There is no new 
hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, or 
evidence of infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in 
size and configuration for the patient's age. The remainder of 
soft tissues and paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.  
IMPRESSION:   
1. Right orbital roof metastasis with osseous destruction again 
demonstrated; no other concerning lesion. 
2. Unchanged small subdural collection along left convexity and 
sequelae of left frontal contusion. 
.
BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS) Study Date of ___ 6:59 ___ 
AP and frog-leg lateral views of the pelvis plus additional AP 
film of each hip and proximal femur. Osseous structures are WNL 
with no bone destruction.  The hips and SI joints are normal and 
symmetric. Vascular calcifications.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 11:55 AM 
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to ___ and intervening chest 
CT scan on ___:   
Large right pleural effusion has increased. Nevertheless, there 
is still 
rightward mediastinal shift reflecting atelectasis from 
obstructing central tumor. Edema in the small right upper lobe 
could be due to congestion from pulmonary venous occlusion shown 
on the chest CTA ___. Left lung is grossly clear. Heart 
size difficult to assess, but grossly unchanged. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with suspected metastitic lung ca presenting with 4 days 
of confusion, s/p fall, found to have SAH and hypercalcemia  
.  
# SAH/AMS: Pt had several days of declining mental status 
leading to a fall. Thus SAH was likely traumatic, there was 
concern for it being ___ mets but intially could not do MRI b/c 
pt could not tolerate during delerium. Neurosurgery consulted in 
ED, and do not feel an acute surgical intervention was 
necessary. Neuro checks were institued.  Because of hx of heavy 
alcholol use there was also concern for possible w/drawal 
symptoms and pt was placed on CIWA but tried to minimize use of 
benzos to avoid exacerbating delerium and eventually able to d/c 
CIWA. Pt was given ativan and zyprexa for agitation. CT of head 
was repeated as pt had a fall from bed but SAH remained 
unchanged. Based on this, neurosurge felt that there still was 
not surgical intevention indicated.  Pt continued to have AMS 
and then spiked a fever, CXR looked like possible PNA/effusion 
and had coarse lung sounds so was started on vanco/zosyn for 
likely obstructive or aspiration PNA. Fever improved as did the 
pt's calcium. Slowly AMS improved. (see below for additional 
details)
.  
# Hypercalcemia/AMS: Hypercalcemia was likely secondary to 
metastatic disease. Was low PTH but PTHrp eventually returned 
positive.  Pt received bisphosphonate at OSH prior to arrive to 
___. Calcitonin and IVF fluids given. Calcium decreased but 
continued to remain elevated. Lasix, steroids and additional 
dose of pamidronate were also given. Renal was consulted for 
help with managment and medications were able to be stopped. 
Eventually combination of interventions resulted in 
normalization of calcium. However, later in hospital course 
___, calcium increased again which was able to be 
controlled w/lasix, fluids; at this point was also due for 
another dose of pamidornate which he received on ___. 
Continued to monitor and give fluids and lasix as needed.  
Calcium began rising again and pt was redosed w/pamidronated on 
___ and Ca improved w/IVF and lasix.
.  
# R basilar and RUL lung opacity, PNA: On initial presentation, 
there was a R basilar and RUL lung opacity and could not rule 
out superimposed PNA on CXR. Pt was reported as having reported 
chills, ""shaking"" (?rigors), and increased cough at home and had 
recent ""head cold."" Was afebrile on admission. Received one dose 
of levaquin in the ED. Has remained afebrile but had mild 
leukocytosis however pt was on steriods b/c of aggressive 
attempts to treat hypercalcemia. However, pt spiked overnight on 
___ w/worsening respiratory status so was put on 
vanco+zosyn while cultures pending were pending. There was 
concern for likely obstructive PNA but b/c of delerium there was 
also concern for aspiration PNA. Pt's responded well to abx, 
respiratory status improved and eventually mental status 
improved as well. On ___ switched to PO levoquin w/plan for 
additional 14 days (last day on ___. Sputum and blood 
cultures-->NGTD. Pt completed the course of levo which was then 
stopped; however, several days later pt became 
confused/delerious again on ___ and had fever, coarse lung 
sounds w/worsened CXR so restarted levoquin and flagyl to be 
continued and completed at rehab on ___.
.  
# Hypernatremia: likely related to poor PO intake and 
hypercalcemia. IVF switched prn to ___ to help decrease 
sodium, fix free water defecit. Resolved on ___ but on ___ 
had elevated sodium again.  Gave ___ or D5W prn; lytes 
normalized.  
.  
# Hypokalemia: diuresis related. Pt's K was very sensitive to 
administration of 10mg IV lasix; drop to 2.7 after 1 dose. 
Monitored and repleted IV and PO prn; repeated EKG which was wnl 
and kept pt on tele.
.  
# Metastatic lung cancer: Initially difficult to work up given 
AMS. Could not get MRI of head initially b/c pt wouldn't 
tolerate due to agitation and delerium. CT of head was done to 
assess for brain mets as a ___ best study (did not show any 
brain mets but showed known bony met in orbit). As AMS cleared, 
were able to get biopsy which showed NSC lung cancer (squamous). 
Later MRI of brain was obtained which did not show brain mets. 
Given that pt's AMS and clinical status had improved 
substantially, decision was made to try an attenuated course of 
chemo w/Carboplatin and Taxol. Got first course as inpt which pt 
tolerated well w/only mild nausea; was dosed again on ___ 
___. Outpt followup planned w/Dr. ___. Pt will have 
radiation treatment in ___ at ___ 
___. 
.  
# ETOH abuse: Pt has reported heavy history of daily ETOH use. 
Unclear day of last drink. Did not want to give benzos 
unecessarily in state of mental confusion. Pt placed on CIWA to 
assess scoring, watch vitals closely and institute meds only 
when necessary. Did not score on CIWA but did receive small 
doses of zyprexa and ativan for control of agitation. This 
resolved as mental status cleared. MVI, folate, thiamine, B12 
supplement. Social work consult. Pt also was started on 10mg 
celexa as it appeared that pt was likely self treating 
depression w/EtOH (very sad after his wife's death ___ ago 
per family and pt later mentioned). 
.

Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital for management of hypercalcemia. He presented with increased confusion, s/p fall with headstrike, and was found to have a serum calcium level of 17. He has a history of presumed metastatic lung cancer, diagnosed approximately two weeks ago based on imaging studies. He has also had a productive cough for the past year, worsening in the past four days, and has been taking Vicodin at home for pain control.

The patient's past medical history includes a presentation to the emergency department two weeks ago with right-sided chest pain, which was found to be a rib fracture, and he was referred to an oncologist. He was told he likely had metastatic lung cancer and was sent for further testing.

The patient's physical exam revealed a cachetic male with altered mental status, diffuse inspiratory crackles, and poor inspiratory effort. His laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as well as elevated calcium and phosphorus levels.

The patient was given 2L of normal saline and IV Levaquin for possible pneumonia, and was also given zoledronic acid. He was transferred to the hospital's emergency department for further management. ||endoftext||"

The patient is an ___ year-old male with H/O hypertension, 
diet-controlled type II diabetes mellitus, and renal carcinoma 
s/p partial right nephrectomy in ___ who presents with dry 
cough and shortness of breath x ___ weeks. Per OMR, he was seen 
at ___'s office two weeks ago for cough. He was treated with 
Augmentin for 10 days, but it is unclear if he took this. In 
addition, at that time, he had stopped all of his medications 
because he felt he was taking too many. His HR was reported at 
113 at that visit- no mention of regular or irregular rhythm. He 
was explained the need to continue medications.  

On presentation, the patient reported dry cough and shortness of 
breath x ___ weeks with worsening over 1 day PTA. He denied 
coughing anything up, but another note in OMR said he had been 
productive of yellow sputum. Per his family, he has had a 
chronic non-productive cough for several years, but this has 
been worsening over the past month. The patient denies fevers, 
chills. He reports palpitations, nausea when coughing a lot, 
wheezing (unclear for how long or whether he has a history of 
wheezing), decreased appetite, swelling in legs, orthopnea. 
There was no chest pain or pleuritic chest pain, vomiting,  
diarrhea, myalgias, fatigue.  He is unsure about weight loss.  

In the ED, his vitals were T 94.5, BP 139/83, HR 125, RR 24, O2 
sat 94% on RA. He was noted to be in ? SVT v. atrial flutter v. 
atrial fibrillation seen on multiple EKGs. He was given 
diltiazem 10 mg IV x2 and then diltiazem 30 mg PO  x1. He 
continued to have rapid ventricular rate and was placed on a

to the previous tracing of ___ atrial fibrillation is new.

___ CXR
Respiratory motion compromises the study. There is a massive 
cardiomegaly again identified. There is a tortuous aorta. 
Pulmonary vascularity is indistinct which may be in part due to 
respiratory motion, although mild element of underlying edema 
cannot be excluded. Increased density is noted in both lung 
bases, particularly in the retrocardiac left lower lobe. There 
is poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm. No definite right 
effusion is seen. There is no large underlying pneumothorax. A 
levoconcave curvature of the thoracic spine is again identified.

___ CXR (PA & lat): 
Frontal and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate severe 
cardiomegaly. There are bilateral pleural effusions left greater 
than right and pulmonary vascular redistribution suggesting mild 
failure. There is no definite infiltrate.  

CXR (___): Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, worsening 
upper zone vascular redistribution.  Bilateral pleural effusions 
also appear slightly larger.  

ECHO (___):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated. 
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF ___ with severe 
hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and moderate 
hypokinesis of the remaining segments. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic

flow limiting disease in one coronary artery and mild, 
non-obstructive diseaese of 2 other coronary arteries.  The LMCA 
had mild plaquing.  The LAD had mild luminal irregularities with 
a 30% stenosis in a diffusely diseased D1 branch.  The LCx had a 
30% mid vessel stenosis.  The RCA had an 80% distal stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided and 
elevated left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 9 mm Hg and 
LVEDP of 20 mm Hg. PA systolic pressure was normal at 28 mm Hg. 
Mean PCWP was top normal at 12 mm Hg. Systemic arterial 
pressures were normal with aortic systolic pressure of 116 mm 
Hg.  Cardiac index was depressed at 1.93 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed 2+ mitral regurgitation and

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an ___ year-old male with hypertension, type II 
diabetes mellitus (diet-controlled), and renal carcinoma s/p 
right partial nephrectomy in ___ presenting with new atrial 
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cough/dyspnea. 
The patient's symptoms initially were thought to be 
multifactorial with bronchitis (given quality of cough and upper 
airway wheezing without fever or leukocytosis), COPD (given 
extensive smoking history and history of prior cough), and 
diastolic heart failure due to atrial fibrillation with rapid 
ventricular rate. Pneumonia was also considered initially given 
LLL rales. The patient was started on azithromycin/ ceftriaxone/ 
and vancomycin (given + blood culture on day of admission) for 
broad coverage. The patient was also placed on respiratory 
precautions given concern for TB. On ___, the patient was found 
to have acute worsening of respiratory status with tachypnea, 
significant wheezing, and desaturations to 80%'s despite being 
on a non-rebreather. He was transferred to the ICU for further 
evaluation.

Brief MICU course: Upon arrival to the ICU, echo results 
returned showing moderate LV systolic dysfunction with severe 
inferolateral hypokinesis and EF ___ (EF 55% in ___, 4+ 
mitral regurgitation, elevated right-sided pressures, and mild 
LVH. A moderate sized echodense pericardial effusion was noted, 
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements, 
with no evidence of tamponade. The patient underwent diagnostic 
L thoracentesis, which showed transudative properties with 
cultures and cytology negative. The patient was effectively 
diuresed 3 liters during MICU stay with dramatic improvement in 
SOB. He was then transferred back to the floor. Remainder of 
hospital course is by problem, as follows:

# Cough/ SOB: As above, the patient was initially started on 
antibiotics to cover for a possible bronchitis/ pneumonia. He 
completed a course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin for this. 
(Vancomycin was d/c'd as GPC were felt to be contamination.) He 
completed a course of prednisone x 3 days and was started on 
Advair with prn levalbuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for 
potential COPD component. The patient was screened for 
tuberculosis with negative AFB smears x 3. Bilateral LENIs were 
negative for DVTs. Once echo results returned, SOB and cough 
were felt to be most likely cardiac in origin with acute 
systolic and diastolic dysfunction and decompensated valvular 
disease contributing. The  patient was effectively diuresed 
approximately >6 L over his hospital course with resolution of 
symptoms and no further oxygen requirement. Upon discharge, the 
patient was continued on cardiac medications, as below, as well 
as Advair inhaler.

# CAD: The patient had no known CAD on admission. There was no 
evidence of MI with negative cardiac biomarkers x 3 and no ST-T 
wave changes suggestive of ischemia. On ___ catheterization, 
the patient was found to have evidence of 1 vessel disease in 
the RCA as well as diffuse plaquing. There were no interventions 
done during catheterization, and there were no current 
indications for CABG. The patient was continued on medical 
management with ASA, ACE-I, beta-blocker, and statin therapy.

# Rhythm: The patient presented with newly diagnosed atrial 
fibrillation on this admission. Etiology was felt to be due to 
severe systolic as well as diastolic dysfunction and 
decompensated valvular disease. The patient was started on 
several agents for HR control, which were uptitrated to the 
following regimen with HR in mostly ___: metoprolol XL 300 
mg daily, diltiazem SR 120 mg daily (added for rate control 
despite the severe LV systolic heart failure), and digoxin 
(therapeutic at 0.9 on discharge). He was continued on a heparin 
drip for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation; however, upon 
discharge decision was made not to pursue Coumadin therapy as 
patient was felt to be a poor candidate due to history of 
medication noncompliance.

# Congestive heart failure, acute, systolic and diastolic, EF 
25%: As mentioned above, the patient was found to have ___ 
mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, elevated R-sided 
pressures, and systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of 
the basal inferolateral wall and moderate hypokinesis of the 
remaining segments with EF 35% on ___ echo. Cath confirmed 
severe systolic LV dysfunction (global HK), mild diastolic 
biventricular dysfunction, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and LVEF 
25%. The patient was aggressively diuresed, as above, and was 
discharged on standing dose of Lasix. He was continued on 
beta-blocker, ACE-I, and CCB for BP and HR control. He was set 
up with Dr. ___ further ___ of heart failure as an 
outpatient.

# Hypertension: The patient presented with hypertension to 
160s/90s, which improved with diuresis, ACE-I, and uptitration 
of metoprolol and diltiazem. BPs upon discharge were 
100s-120s/50s-60s.

# Decompensated Mitral Valve Disease: ___ echo revealed 4+ 
mitral regurgitation of unclear etiology. The patient was 
treated medically while in house with resolution of symptoms. No 
plan was made for MV repair given that the patient was 
asymptomatic; however, MVR may be an option in the future if 
medical management fails.

# Pericardial effusion: The patient presented with an enlarged 
cardiac silhouette on admission CXR, with ___ echo revealing 
moderate sized effusion with mixed echogenic material. Effusion 
was of unclear etiology - inflmammation vs infection vs 
malignancy vs hemorrhagic. There were no echocardiographic signs 
of tamponade, no pulsus paradoxus on exam, and no evidence of 
tamponade on catheterization. There was no change in effusion 
size on serial echos. Decision was made not to perform 
pericardiocentesis as effusion seemed stable and the patient was 
asymptomatic. Malignant etiology of effusion was considered; 
however, this is less likely as pleural effusion analysis had 
negative cytology.

# Ophthalomology: The patient was blind in left eye (does not 
know etiology of this), and right eye had conjunctival injection 
on admission. Per the patient, injection was secondary to not 
using prednisiolone acetate 1% eye drops. Ophtalmology was 
consulted, and they recommended to use prednisilone acetate 1% 
in R eye QD to prevent rejection of corneal implant.

# Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient has a history of RCC s/p 
right partial nephrectomy in ___. Creatinine remained stable 
throughout hospital course, near baseline of 1.0-1.2. The 
patient is followed by urology as an outpatient with no acute 
issues. As above, pleural effusion cytology was negative for 
malignant cells.

# Hematuria: The patient had brief episode of hematuria upon 
removal of Foley catheter, likely secondary to Foley trauma. He 
was briefly kept on CBI with subsequent resolution of hematuria.

# DMII: The patient has a history of diet-controlled DM, with 
recent HbA1c of 5.8%. He was continued on an ISS while inhouse, 
but demonstrated good glycemic control on a diabetic diet. He 
was discharged with a glucometer to check finger sticks 
regularly.

# BPH: The patient was continued on outpatient finasteride. 
Doxazosin was held due to low BP.

# Code: FULL (confirmed with patient and HCP - ___.

# COMMUNICATION: ___ (c: ___ is the 
first contact and ___ (c: ___ is second 
contact; daughter ___ ___.  ___

IMAGING
-------
RUQ US with Dopplers patent main and R portal veins

CTABD
1. Nonspecific geographic areas of low attenuation throughout 
the
liver are seen with hepatic vasculature seen coursing through. 
Differential considerations include hepatic infarction versus
geographic fat.  Recommend follow-up liver ultrasound to 
evaluate
the hepatic vasculature.  Further evaluation the hepatic
parenchyma should be evaluated with preferably contrast
enhanced liver MRI or multiphasic CT abdomen.
2. Multiple nonobstructing left renal calculi.
3. Interval removal of the gastrostomy tube.
4. No obvious fluid collections are identified within the
confines of a noncontrast enhanced exam.

CXR ___:
Bibasilar opacities, presumably atelectasis.  Possibility of 
infection cannot be entirely excluded.  Otherwise, clear lungs.

G-tube check ___:
16 ___ mic gastrostomy tube in the stomach.

Discharge labs
___

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with complicated past medical history 
including CVA s/p hemicraniectomy, TAC with end ileostomy 
(History of crohns), recent admission to ___ on ___ with 
SBO for which she underwent exlap, LOA, reduction of internal 
hernia c/b abdominal wall soft tissue necrosis/infection 
followed failed abdominal graft (___) who presented from 
___ rehab for G-tube replacement, found to have 
hyperglycemia, ___, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic 
acidosis. She was admitted to the FICU for closer monitoring 
with improvement in her AGMA, resulting in transfer to medicine 
service. Ultimately the end of her hospitalization involved 
adjustments of her insulin and tube feeding regimen in order to 
obtain adequate glycemic control. 

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis
# Respiratory acidosis
# Lactic acidosis
Patient presented with elevated lactate and AGMA. The suspect 
etiology was hypovolemia with improvement in lactate after 4L 
IVF. There was brief increase in lactate to 5 while in ICU but 
this was felt to be a spurious value with improvement after 1L 
of IVF. No evidence of ketones in urine to suggest DKA despite 
elevated glucose on presentation. Patient remained normotensive 
in FICU with improvement in AGMA and downtrend in lactate. Given 
stability, she was transferred to medicine service.  She 
remained stable during her stay. Anion gap closed. 

# G-tube
# Nutrition
G-tube dislodged at outside facility. Surrounding erythema and 
tenderness. Plastic surgery and wound consult evaluated the site 
and were not concerned by its appearance. ___ was consulted for 
G-tube replacement and the existing tube was put back in place.  
Her tube feeds were restarted and advanced to goal.  She was 
able to tolerate a full regular diet before discharge, but not 
quite at goal in terms of nutrition. As such her tube feeds are 
currently running continuous, and as a result her insulin 
regimen, outlined below, needed titration. Initially she was 
also placed on a pureed solid/thin liquid diet however this was 
advanced to soft solids/thin liquids before discharge. Once able 
to take sufficient PO intake, her tube feeds may be changed to 
Glucerna 1.2 @ 60 mL/hr x12hours w/ Juven TID ___ kcal, 50 g 
protein, 1590 mL free water), with monitoring of sodium and 
hydration status; adjust flushes prn. Her insulin will also need 
titration as her tube feeds are adjusted. 

# Concern for aspiration
Several days ago was found to have food in her mouth. SLP 
recommending pureed solids with thin liquids, Meds crushed in 
applesauce via tube, 1:1 feeds. Patient very unhappy with this 
change, SLP re-evaluated and recommended soft solids with thin 
liquids. Hopefully this will help with augmentation of her PO 
intake. 

# Diabetes with hyperglycemia
Glucose in the 500s on presentation. Started on insulin drip in 
ED, transitioned to SC. No ketones on UA, Beta-OH wnl.  She was 
given her home glargine and sliding scale insulin, but had blood 
sugar 300s.  ___ was consulted and increased her home Lantus 
and Humalog. Ultimately, likely due to continuous tube feeding 
rather than cycled, her insulin requirements went up 
significantly. At the time of discharge she is requiring the 
following: 
-lantus 70 units BID
-Humalog q4hrs with scale: 
71-100: 0 units
101-150: 12 units
151-200: 17 units
201-250: 22 units
251-300: 27 units
301-350: 32 units
351-400: 37 units
>400: 42 units
Her sugars have been running in the high 200-low 300s by the 
time of discharge (significantly improved). Anticipate that as 
her PO feeds pick up and tube feeds become night time 
only/cycled, she could go back to her home insulin regimen 
(lantus 50 units BID, Humalog 16 units TIDWM). For now, she will 
need q4hrs Humalog until continuous tube feeds are 
stopped/tapered off.  

# Pyuria
# Urinary tract infection: Endorsed dysuria on admission.  UA 
was positive, but urine culture was negative.  Empiric 
ceftriaxone was started and stopped.

# Abdominal wound
# Abdominal pain
Patient presented with abdominal pain. Exam notable for 
significant erythema surrounding ileostomy site and abdominal 
wound. CT scan without evidence for abdominal pain. At this 
point, suspect that her abdominal pain is related to the skin 
erythema.  Plastic surgery and wound care were consulted and 
provided recommendations for wound care. 

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis recently. Possibly related to hepatic 
infarction (infarction vs geographic fat on CT), but ultrasound 
shows main and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal 
flow. Hepatitis B and C serologies were sent and were negative. 
Plan was to continue to trend LFTs. 

# Acute kidney injury: Likely pre-renal. Improved with IV 
fluids.

# Hypercalcemia: Suspect related to dehydration and immobility. 
Improved with IV fluids. Ca2+ 10.7 on the day of discharge, will 
need monitoring periodically with tube feeding. 

# Hypertension: amlodipine and metoprolol were initially held 
while she was critically ill and as she remained normotensive 
these were not resumed. If/when BP starts to trend up, would 
resume these. HR around the ___, so could consider Metoprolol 
first, but might consider starting at lower doses than she had 
been on before. 

# h/o CVA w/ residual asphasia and right hemiplegia: patient was 
continued on her home baclofen, gabapentin, and lidocaine patch

# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: patient was given 
duonebs and albuterol prn

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin

# Depression: continued amitriptyline

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis recently. Possibly related to hepatic 
infarction (infarction vs geographic fat on CT), but ultrasound 
shows main and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal 
flow.
- hepatitis serologies negative
- abdominal exam benign 
- outpatient follow up 
- LFTs trended down slightly before discharge, will need repeats 
in ___ weeks to ensure stable/trending down 

TRANSITIONS OF CARE
-------------------
# Follow-up: patient will return to rehab and will need 
continued diabetic management. As tube feeding can be 
de-escalated to qhs, insulin regimen should be titrated as well. 
Would suggest close electrolyte monitoring during this 
transition. Ca2+ elevated at 10.7 at the time of discharge, but 
___ resolved by the time of discharge. 
Would also repeat LFTs in ___ weeks as they were mildly 
elevated. 

Time spent: 55 minutes

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent 
hospitalization.  You came to the hospital with a dislodged 
gastric tube.  This was put back in place, and your tube feeds 
were restarted.  You are now being discharged. Your insulin 
regimen was adjusted due to persistently elevated blood sugars 
in the hospital. As you begin to eat more orally, your tube 
feeding regimen can be scaled back to night time only as it had 
been before, and we anticipate your insulin dose will also be 
able to decrease. Since you aren't eating much as of now, we 
recommend keeping your insulin doses higher for now. 

It is important that you continue to take your medications as 
prescribed and follow up with the medical team at your facility 
for further care.

We wish you the best. 

Sincerely, 
Your care team at ___ 

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 ","||startoftext|| The patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for G-tube replacement. She has a complicated past medical history, including a stroke with residual deficits, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and a total colectomy with ileostomy. She was recently readmitted from another hospital for a small bowel obstruction and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, left ostomy, and reduction of internal hernia, but unfortunately, the abdominal graft failed.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient complained of abdominal pain around her ileostomy site and PEG tube site, as well as burning with urination. She was found to have hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic acidosis, with concern for intraabdominal infection. She was started on insulin and antibiotics, and a CT abdomen showed nonspecific areas of low attenuation in the liver, which may be due to hepatic infarction or geographic fat.

The patient underwent several procedures, including G-tube placement and replacement, and was prescribed several medications, including insulin, antibiotics, and pain medication. She was also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was treated with antibiotics.

The patient's physical exam revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness around the PEG tube site and ileostomy site, as well as a left thigh skin wound. Her neurological exam showed residual deficits from her stroke, including right-sided hemiplegia. ||endoftext||"

No failure is present. Costophrenic angles are clear. No 
evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax is present. There has been 
no significant change since the prior film of ___. 
IMPRESSION: No acute process. 
.
COLONOSCOPY ___:
A single pedunculated 6 mm polyp of benign appearance was found 
in the ascending colon. A single-piece polypectomy was performed 
using a cold snare. The polyp was completely removed. Two 
pedunculated polyps of benign appearance and ranging in size 
from 4 mm to 5 mm were found in the descending colon. 
Single-piece polypectomies were performed using a cold snare. 
The polyps were completely removed. A single sessile 5 mm polyp 
of benign appearance was found in the sigmoid colon. A 
single-piece polypectomy was performed using a cold forceps. The 
polyp was completely removed. A single pedunculated 2.5 cm polyp 
was found in the sigmoid colon. After polyp removal, a 2 cm clot 
was seen to form at the site of polypectomy. 7 clips were 
applied to the polypectomy site and hemostasis was achieved. A 
single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare in the 
sigmoid polyp. The polyp was completely removed.  Recommend 
repeat colonoscopy in 3 months due to poor prep.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ woman with a history of severe GERD, CAD, 
paroxysmal afib, and HTN who is admitted for 3 melanotic stools.
.
# MELENA: The patient was admitted to the MICU for further 
management.  Ms. ___ was monitored overnight and remained 
hemodynamically stable, with unchanged hematocrit, and was not 
transfused.  The patient was started on a pantoprazole drip, 
which was changed pantoprazole 40mg BID. Her aspirin, Coumadin, 
and metoprolol were held in the setting of acute bleed.  Patient 
had endoscopy on ___, which demonstrated antral gastritis and a 
pedunculated polyp (likely inflammatory).  However, no obvious 
bleeding source was discovered.  A colonoscopy was performed on 
___, which showed numerous polyps including one large polyp in 
the sigmoid colon, which was thought to be the likely cause of 
bleeding.  Polyp was clipped and patient was observed for 48 
hours.  Patient will need repeat colonoscopy in 3 months as prep 
was very poor.  After colonoscopy, patient had no more episodes 
of bleeding and remained hemodynamically stable.  Her Coumadin 
and aspirin continued to be held in the ___ period.  
These medications can be restarted at the discretion of 
patient's PCP.  Metoprolol was re-started. Patient will have GI 
follow-up as well.
.
# GERD:  Patient continued to complain of GERD-like symptoms 
throughout the duration of her admission.  She had a moderate 
response to ""magic mouth wash"" and Maalox.  She was continued on 
home medication of BID lansoprazole.  (Patient's nurse 
speculated however, that patient is not taking her medications 
properly at home).
.
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Patient continued to be in 
normal sinus rhythm throughout hospital admission.  Her 
Coumadin, aspirin, and metoprolol were stopped in light of GI 
bleed.  Her Toprol XL 50mg BID was restarted on discharge, but 
Coumadin and aspirin were held.  These medications can be 
restarted at the discretion of patient's PCP or cardiologist 
(both of whom were contacted during admission). 
.
# ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY: EF from echo in ___ is ___.  
Lasix was originally held in light of GI bleed, but was 
restarted toward the end of hospital stay.  Patient complained 
of feeling ""swollen"" after missing Lasix for a few days.  
Patient will follow-up with cardiology for further management of 
heart failure.
.
# ELEVATED LFTS/PANCREATIC MASS:  Patient has elevated LFTs, 
dilated CBD, and pancreatic masses as seen on abdominal CT in 
___.  As per radiology report, masses are likely consistent 
with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas 
(IPMN).  According to GI note, there is malignant potential and 
these masses will need to be worked up (possible with MRCP).  
Statin was held in light of elevated LFTs but can be restarted 
at the discretion of patient's PCP.
.
# ___ AND INSURANCE:  Patient's insurance was unable to pay for 
both ___ and home ___.  Patient needs ___ due to a recent fall in 
the bathroom (and ___ could not be canceled).  She will be able 
to reapply for ___ after she finishes with ___.  This can be 
coordinated at discretion of patient's PCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
======================
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
======================
___ year old psychiatrist with a history of obesity, 
hypertension, chronic right thalamic stroke, and achalasia who 
presented to the ___ ED as a transfer from ___ 
urgent care with dyspnea found to have acute HFrEF.

The patient was noted to have globally reduced systolic function 
with an EF of 34%. He received Lasix for diuresis. The patient 
ultimately went for left and right heart catheterization on 
___ which demonstrated normal filling pressures at a weight 
of 96.4 kg (212.52 lb) and 70% LAD lesion that was not thought 
to be contributory to global systolic dysfunction. No 
intervention was done at this time. Heart failure was ultimately 
thought to be secondary to hypertension with possible 
contribution from sleep disorder or stimulant medications. He 
was discharged to rehab and will follow up with Dr. ___ 
___ in cardiology in the coming weeks. 

========================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================

#MEDICATION CHANGES:
[]New medications: Aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg 
nightly, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol succinate 25 mg 
daily, torsemide 20 mg daily
[]Changed medications: Amlodipine decreased to 5mg daily
[]Held medications: Sildenafil

#OBJECTIVE MEASURES:
[]Dry weight was determined to be: 96.4 kg (212.52 lb) -- at 
this weight the patient was euvolemic based on right heart 
catheterization filling pressures
[]Discharge Cr: 1.5

#REHAB:
[]Please continue to monitor weights and uptitrate torsemide as 
needed for goal dry weight as above. If patient weight 
increasing, please call outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___ 
___ at ___ to discuss plan for diuresis.
[]Please check renal function and electrolytes 3 days after 
discharge to confirm they are stable on current 
diuresis/medication regimen
[]Please monitor BPs and titrate antihypertensives accordingly

#PCP:
[]Patient was noted to have ___ breathing during his 
hospital stay, likely indicative of underlying sleep disorder. 
He should have a sleep study done as an outpatient for further 
workup, as this may be the potential contributing factor to his 
heart failure.
[]Please try to wean the patient off of stimulants and other 
psychiatric medications as tolerated as this may also be 
contributing to his cardiomyopathy.
[]Please check BPs, lytes, and renal function at next visit and 
titrate medications accordingly
[]Consider GI referral for ongoing management of achalasia 

#CARDIOLOGY:
[]Consider further workup for global hypokinesis and HFrEF
[]Would recommend outpatient CMR to evaluate for myocarditis or 
other etiology of systolic dysfunction
[]Please continue to titrate medications and consider additional 
medications for guideline directed management as blood pressures 
and renal function allows

==========================
PROBLEM-BASED SUMMARY 
==========================

#Acute HFrEF
Presented with difficult volume exam, but presumed warm and wet, 
with reduced EF in a global pattern which could be hypertensive 
heart disease in the setting of essential hypertension and 
stimulant use. RHC shows patient euvolemic at weight of 96.4kg 
(212.52 lbs). Coronary cath noted 70% LAD lesion not thought to 
be contributory to global systolic dysfunction with some other 
nonocclusive disease, no intervention. As such, ischemic 
etiology unlikely. Pt denies EtOH use. Underlying sleep disorder 
may be a contributing factor. Treated with ASA 81, atorvastatin 
80 for CAD in addition to h/o stroke as below. Could consider 
outpatient Cardiac MR for further evaluation of systolic 
dysfunction including to evaluate for myocarditis or other 
etiologies.
Preload: torsemide 20 daily
Afterload: lisinopril 5mg daily, amlodipine 5mg daily
NHBK: metoprolol succinate 25mg daily

#Hypertension 
-Amlodipine 10mg daily initially held, but restarted at 5mg at 
discharge given persistent hypertension despite new 
antihypertensives
-Metoprolol and lisinopril as above 

___
No recent hypotension, contrast, or new medications. This may be 
a reflection of cardiorenal syndrome vs. progression to CKD from 
uncontrolled hypertension or obstructive uropathy from BPH. Cr 
downtrended to 1.3 on ___. Cr uptrend to 1.8 on ___, since 
improved.

#Right thalamic stroke
Secondary prevention with ASA 81, atorvastatin 80.

#Achalasia 
Suspect that he is aspiration given his history of coughing 
spells with corn or rice. Speech and swallow felt that he was 
otherwise tolerating his diet well without any issues. No 
indication that achalasia has recurred given doing well with 
current diet. Continued to monitor. Consider GI referral as an 
outpatient if this is an ongoing issue. 

#Depression 
-Sertraline 25mg daily 

#Insomnia 
-Triazolam 0.25mg QHS as needed 

#BPH 
-Tamsulosin 0.4mg daily 

#Lumbar disc disease 
#Pain 
-Gabapentin 200mg BID 
-Oxycodone 5mg every ___ hours as needed

___ Stokes breathing, improved
Likely underlying sleep disorder, transitional issue for sleep 
study and nocturnal nasal cannula as needed while in house.
