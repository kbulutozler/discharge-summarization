Discharge Instructions:
It has been a privilege to take care of you ___ 
___.
.
You were hospitalized because your heart was beating very slowly 
because of an abnormality in the electrical wiring system of 
your heart; you have a condition known as complete heart block.
.
You underwent an emergency procedure to implant a pacemaker into 
your chest that provides your heart with a regular electrical 
current to ensure that it beats at the correct rhythm. You 
tolerated the procedure well and the pacemaker is functioning 
correctly. This pacemaker will hopefully help to prevent 
recurrence of the fatigue that you have been experiencing.
.
You should avoid raising your arms above your head, and should 
also avoid heavy lifting, for the next several weeks.  Do not 
remove the steri-strips over the site where the pacemaker was 
placed.

Implantation of a pacemaker is surgical procedure, which is why 
you will require antibiotics to prevent infections. The 
following is your antibiotic regimen:
# START: Clindamycin 300 mg every 6h for 1 day
.
Otherwise, your heart regimen is unchanged. Your current heart 
regimen is the following:
# CONTINUE: Torsemide 60 mg twice daily
# CONTINUE: Lisinopril 10 mg daily
# CONTINUE: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual tablet as needed for 
CP
**Take up to 3 tablets 5 minutes apart then call ___ if pain 
does not resolve.**
# CONTINUE: Cholestyramine 4 gram packet daily
# CONTINUE: Ezetimibe 10 mg daily
.

History of Present Illness:
History is obtained from the medical record and from the patient 
with her son serving as interpreter. Please see also OMR notes 
by Dr. ___ ___ ___ for 
additional information. Briefly, Ms. ___ is a ___ year old 
___ woman who has multiple medical problems including 
diet-controlled type II diabetes, hypertension, chronic joint 
pain (osteoarthritis and seronegative RA vs. PMR), and recent 
visual problems with ocular discomfort. She has had recent 
complaints of chest pain and progressive dyspnea on exertion (to 
the point where she has had to crawl up stairs and sit down 
while shopping) for which she has been evaluated by Dr. 
___. 
.
In terms of her chest pain and DOE, she describes both as 
occurring together. The chest pain is present constantly, 
ranging from severity of ___ to ___ and is worse with 
movement, pressure to the chest wall, deep breathing, or 
exertion. The shortness of breath is only with activity and does 
not occur at rest. She describes the chest pain as pressure-like 
in quality and occuring in the center chest to beneath the left 
breast. She has had these symptoms for several months but feels 
that they have been getting worse recently. She has had a cough 
for about the last two months which is occasionally productive 
of ___ sputum; she initially thought that this was due to a 
cold and had some associated runny nose, though now feels cough 
is not due to URI as it has persisted.
.
She underwent echocardiogram in ___ which showed mild LVH 
with preserved ejection fraction (> 55%) and was otherwise 
unrevealing in terms of etiology for her dyspnea. In addition, 
she has had periodic complaints of heart palpitations for which 
she was been monitored by ___ of Hearts; 7 symptomatic episodes 
revealed sinus rhythm at rate ___ with occasional APBs and 
atrial bigeminy.  She did undergo stress test back in ___ by 
___ which was negative for ischemia, but has had no 
further stress testing since that time. Currently, she is 
awaiting ophthalmologic procedure for her eye discomfort, and 
her ophthalmologist at ___ Eye & ___ has recommended complete 
cardiac work up prior to this procedure (details unclear as 
notes are out of our system; however, per Dr. ___ 
note from ___ it is ""non urgent""). In addition, per Dr. 
___ from ___, cardiac catheterization is 
indicated to evaluate for left main disease prior to surgery 
requiring monitored anesthesia care, as well as to further 
evaluate for coronary artery disease given her multiple risk 
factors for atherosclerosis.  She had cardiac catheterization 
planned recently, although this procedure was cancelled given 
her aspirin allergy and the possible need for intervention. The 
patient was given the option of waiting for allergy appointment 
to further evaluate this allergy or for CCU admission for rapid 
desensitization, and chose the latter.
.  
On review of systems, she denies any recent fever, chills, 
nightsweats or rigors. She denies prior history of stroke, TIA, 
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time 
of surgery. No PND or clear orthopnea (must sleep on her side 
secondary to back/spine pain). She does have swelling of the 
ankles which has been stable, as well as swelling in the knees 
from her arthritis (L > R). She has had palpitations for which 
___ has worn ___ monitor as above. She has multiple myalgias and 
joint pains for which she is followed in ___ clinic; 
these are stable. Cough as per HPI with no hemoptysis. No 
N/V/D/C, no abdominal pain, no changes in bowel habits (last BM 
this morning, normal), no black stools or red stools. She has 
had several episodes of LH over the past several days, most 
recently two days ago when she felt lightheaded after getting 
out of a car and had to sit and hold her head. No syncope. No 
dysuria or hematuria. All of the other review of systems were 
negative.

CXR (___):
In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung 
volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse 
diameter of the heart. There is fullness of indistinct pulmonary 
vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, 
beyond that which would be expected with poor inspiration on a 
portable examination. 

Cardiac Cath (___): 
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed 
no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LMCA 
was free 
from angiographic disease.  The LAD had mild plaquing. The 
ostial 
diagonal branch demonstrated 60% focal stenosis.  The LCx was a 
small 
vessel giving rise to a large OM1 (functionally a ramus 
intermedis) and 
four other tiny OMs.  The RCA was a large dominant vessel with 
mild 
plaquing. 
  
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided 
filling 
pressures with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and LVEDP of 18 mm Hg. There 
was 
moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 
52 mm Hg. 
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.17 L/min/m2.  There was 
significant 
systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP 181 mmHg.  
Diastolic 
blood pressures was 82 mm Hg. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 
___ F with multiple medical problems and recent complaints of 
worsening dyspnea on exertion who presents for planned CCU 
admission for aspirin desensitization prior to cardiac 
catheterization for further work up of DOE.  
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# Diastolic CHF: Pt has diastolic CHF based on cardiac cath, and 
given the absence of coronary disease, this is likely the cause 
of her exertional dyspnea. This is consistent with her 
longstanding history of HTN. She was diuresed with IV lasix and 
her home lasix was increased to 20mg po daily. She was also 
started on metoprolol succinate 50 mg qday and lisinopril 2.5mg 
po qday. At the time of discharge she was asymptomatic and her 
weight was 64.5kg.  
.
# Pulmonary HTN: Pt has significant pulmonary HTN (PA pressure 
52/___) based on cardiac cath, and this is likely also 
contributing to exertional dyspnea. This is likely ___ her left 
sided diastolic CHF, but given history of bronchiectasis, cannot 
rule out a primary pulmonary component to her elevated PA 
pressures. She was discarged on ACEI, diuretic and beta blocker 
per above. 
.

1. CXR (___)
Lungs are well expanded, with linear opacities at the lung 
bases, most likely representing atelectasis. However, 
curvilinear opacity could also represent scarring. Heart is 
normal in size, 
and there is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement. Soft tissue 
and bony structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSIONS: Atelectasis 
versus scarring at the left lung base. No acute 
abnormalities. 
2. CT Head w/o Contrast (___)
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, mass 
effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major 
vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are normal 
in caliber and configuration. Visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are well aerated. Osseous structures are 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Loss of Consciousness:
Most likely this was due to hypovolemia given pt's history of 
diarrhea, decreased PO intake and orthostatic symptoms. BP was 
also low on admission. Other concern on admission was for 
cardiogenic syncope.  EKG showed ST-T wave changes with T wave 
inversions in V1-V4 which were unchanged from prior ECGs.  
Troponins and CK were cycled and showed a Troponin of 0.08 which 
did not rise and was likely due to her kidney disease.  Pt had 
no signs of congestive heart failure and an echo was done which 
was normal.  She had no clinical signs of PE.  Has a history of 
seizures and migraines; however no seizure activity was 
observed. TIA/CVA is also unlikely with normal neuro exam. Pt 
also had a history of hypothyroidism and TSH was check and was 
>100.  Free T4 was low at 0.28. Pt has been non-compliant with 
meds in the past but stated that she had not missed any of her 
thyroid medication.  Pt's home pharmacy was called and stated 
that the prescription had last been filled in early ___ but 
had not been filled prior to this.  TSH was checked in the past 
___ and ___ and was elevated at this time as well.  Pt also 
had symptoms of hypothyroidism with weight gain, weakness, 
fatigue, headache and dry skin. Pt was also reported to be 
hypoglycemic on presentation and this could have been a 
contributing factor to syncope with poor oral intake. 
.
On admission, pt was due for dialysis and did undergo HD with 
2.3L removed. On arrival to the floor, BP was low at 80/40.  Pt 
required 2.5L of fluid resuscitation to bring BP to 100s.  She 
was asymptomatic during this time without chest pain, 
lightheadedness or dizziness.  Blood and urine cultures were 
sent and negative.  A urine tox was negative.  Orthostatic BPs 
were checked after fluid resuscitation and were normal.  An 
echocardiogram was done which was normal with an EF of 55%.  Pt 
did well clinically during admission and experienced no other 
symptoms of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.  Her 
anti-hypertensive medications were held in light of her low 
blood pressure.  She was given Levothyroxine at 100mcg/day given 
her low levels of T4 (was previously supposed to be taking 
75mcg/day).
.
The patient experienced no further symptoms of syncope during 
admission.  Telemetry showed no arrhythmias and echocardiogram 
was normal.
.
2. Hypoglycemia:

45 at ___. Fingersticks were checked throughout admission and 
blood sugars with in the low-normal range of ___.  LFTs 
were checked for possible causes for hypoglycemia and were with 
AST 45 and ALT 27.
.  
3. Diarrhea: 
Pt stated that diarrhea symptoms had been present prior to 
admission and continued through hospital stay.  Stool cultures 
and ova and parasites were negative.  Likely cause was viral 
gastroenteritis vs. narcotic withdrawal.
. 
4. Substance Abuse: 
Pt was on 120mg methadone daily per ___ clinic.  On date 
of admission, she did not receive this and began to experience 
withdrawal symptoms of anxiety and agitation.  She was given 
120mg of Methadone daily for her hx of narcotic abuse and 
withdrawal symptom prevention. She was given Trazadone 50 qhs as 
per home dose.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is an ___ lady, speaking only ___, with 
___ gastric cancer (diagnosed ___, currently on ramucirumab 
alone (held following surgery) and arthritis, who presented with 
a hip fracture after a fall from standing height.  

===ACUTE ISSUES=== 
#Hip fracture:  
#s/p Fall:  
Presented after a fall from standing height and found to have a 
right intertrochanteric hip fracture with varus angulation. CT 
head with subgaleal hematoma but no intracranial hemorrhage, and 
CT C spine negative for traumatic injury. Fall appears to be 
purely mechanical secondary to underlying neuropathy and 
progressive weakness with possible acute decompensation in the 
setting of pneumonia. She had no LOC, but may have an 
orthostatic component as well contributing to lightheadedness 
given poor PO intake. Troponins obtained for pre-op workup were 
slightly elevated x3 (max 0.03). Likely ___ slight ___, EKGs w/o 
e/o MI. 

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service with 
a right hip fracture. The patient was taken to the operating 
room on ___ for right hip ORIF, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given ___ antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient worked with ___ who 
determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
weight-bearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity, and 
will be discharged on ___ for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough discussion was 
had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or 
return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The 
patient was also given written instructions concerning 
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care. 
The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

 
#LLL pneumonia: CXR obtained on pre-op workup showed LLL 
opacity. Unclear if she had a true clinical pneumonia given she 
so did not have symptoms of pneumonia, but fall could be due to 
weakness in the setting of infection. Did not meet criteria for 
HAP. Treated with five day course of ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin. 
 
===CHRONIC ISSUES===
#Gastric cancer: 
Diagnosed ___. Treated with 5 cycles on folfox, followed by 
taxol/ramucirumab for 5 cycles (C5 D1 and ___. Seen by 
oncologist Dr. ___ on ___ who recommended stopping 
taxol and proceeding with ramucirumab alone due to concerns that 
the taxol was causing worsening neuropathy and interfering with 
her quality of life. Of note, ramucirumab was held following her 
operation. Will need outpatient evaluation and discussion of 
goals of care to determine further treatment course. In 
addition, patient had therapeutic paracentesis while inpatient 
on ___.

#GERD: Continued home omeprazole BID.  
#Hypertension: Held spironolactone given elevated creatinine at 
___ initially, restarted on ___.
#Depression: Held home citalopram for prolonged QTc. Lower dose 
may be safer for age.  
#Overactive bladder: Held home fesoterodine as was 
non-formulary.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ F with history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis 
c/b diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension and 
encephalopathy currently on transplant list, IDDM, HTN and HLD 
who was directly admitted from home for acute renal failure.
  
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr < 1.5. Admitted with 
creatinine of 2.0, FeNa on admission 0.28% indicating pre-renal 
state. No evidence of infection on admission without fevers, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, suprapubic tenderness or dysuria, UA 
with epis and does not indicate UTI. Patient received albumin 
1g/kg (62.5grams) on HD 1 and morning after creatinine improved 
to 1.7. On HD 2 H/H was low so instead of albumin patient was 
volume challenged with 1 unit PRBCs and 25grams of albumin (1 
unit PRBCs=25 grams albumin). Diagnostic paracentesis ruled out 
SBP. Creatinine worsened after initial volume challenge and did 
not respond to second round of 1g/kg albumin. After failed 
improvement diagnosis of hepatorenal synrome was made and 
midodrine/octreotide were started and uptitrated without 
improvement in creatinine.  Cr steadily continued to rise, 
patient became oliguric and was volume overloaded.  The renal 
team was consulted.  Initially, plan was for pt to have HD line 
placed in ___ and start dialysis.  However, given active bleeding 
(see below), she was trasferred to SICU and started on CVVH.
       
# Cirrhosis: Chronic, related to schistosomiasis complicated by 
diuretic refractory ascites, chronic renal failure, portal 
hypertension, thrombocytopenia, prior SBP and encephalopathy. 
MELD 20 on admission with Childs Class C. Without evidence of 
encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation or asterixis on 
admission. Continued Rifaximin 550mg PO BID and Lactulose TID 
for HE prophylaxis. Continued Ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. 
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed and ruled out SBP. No GI 
endoscopy in our system but patient being evaluated for 
transplant, cannot be on transplant list without endoscopy so 
presumably completed somewhere. MELD rose to >30 in setting of 
hepatorenal syndrome and patient was listed for ABO incompatible 
liver. As HRS progressed, MELD score was at 40 on transfer to 
the SICU.

# Pulmonary edema: Pt w/ pulm edema on CXR on ___ and mildly 
symptomatic. Initially, pt subjectively some SOB, but O2 low to 
mid ___ on RA.  After 2 days, developed O2 requirement.  
Overload most likely in the setting of rapidly deteriorating 
renal function.  Less likely cirrhosis induced cardiomyopathy.  
Last TTE ___ with normal EF.  Repeat TTE with still normal EF 
but new moderate PA systolic HTN. Attempted to diurese with 
Lasix 20 iv then 80, put out very small amt of urine, 
incontinent.   In setting of rapidly progressive HRS, pt became 
oliguric and was unable to mobilize fluid.  Plan was made for 
dialysis as above.

# Hard palate bleed:  On ___ at ~6am, pt developed bleed right 
hard palate.  This was likely ___ mild oral trauma in the 
setting of coagulopathy--INR 3.6, platelets 75.  Initially, 
attempted to stop by applying pressure, unsuccessful.  Per 
discussion with ENT and OMFS, attempted to stop the bleed with 
afrin soaked gauze, topical thrombin, silver nitrate, 
aminocaproic acid.  Also transfused with platelets, FFP, and 
RBCs (as hct was 22 down from 25 at last check). Held continuous 
pressure for ~3 hours.  As soon as pressure was released, active 
bleeding was visualized.  Tamponaded bleed for ~10 minutes, but 
again continued to have uncontrollable bleed and was transferred 
to SICU on the transplant surgery service for elective 
intubation and packing.  The lesion was cauterized and the 
bleeding was controlled.  She was initially successfully 
extubated at transferred to the floor. 

# Hyponatremia: Hypervolumic hyponatremia from cirrhosis. Did 
not diurese patient given ___. Albumin and PRBCs given for 
intravascular volume and patient kept on 1.5L fluid restricted 
diet. She remained hyponatremic so fluid restricted further to 
1.2L with improvement in Na.
    
# Acute anemia: Patient with chronic anemia related to cirrhosis 
though with acute drop on HD 2. Unclear etiology without GIB 
during admission. Unknown if patient has varices without 
endoscopy in our system and is not on beta-blocker so presumably 
none on prior endoscopy. Possible hct drop was in setting of 
volume challenge overnight and dilutional effect though WBC and 
platelets unchanged. She was transfused 1 unit PRBCs both for 
anemia and volume challenge. Hct remained stable following 
transfusion.
     
# DM: Insulin Dependent, Type II. Hyperglycemic during admissin. 
Continued Glargine 12 units qHS and HISS
    
# HLD: Chronic, stable, continue zetia 
   
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Continue holding diuretics
- Recommend tracking down endoscopy report, unknown where 
completed

ICU Course ___ to ___, date of death)
Ms ___ was transferred to the surgical ICU the morning of 
___ after developing worsening melena. She had an EGD the day 
prior for the purpose of Dobhoff feeding tube placement, and 
during that EGD a duodenal polyp was noted and biopsied. Of 
note, she had an INR of 2.5 and fibrinogen of 59 prior to the 
procedure so snare removal of the polyp was deferred. The 
evening following the EGD, she had several episodes of melena 
thus prompting transfer to the ICU to facilitate repeat emergent 
EGD. The EGD ___ showed a lot of old blood around the polyp, but 
no active bleed from the stalk. 
The first few days in the SICU she remained HD stable, but 
continued to have melena with an unstable hematocrit. We 
transfused RBC, FFP, platelets and cryo to goal Hct of 30 and 
correct her coagulopathy. We were unable to completely correct 
her, and she began having significant oral bleeding. By ___, 
she was coughing blood, had an increased oxygen requirement. She 
remained encephalopathic and was not protecting her airway 
sufficiently so she was intubated. After intubation she had a 
pressor requirement which remained until time of death. She was 
started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/mica) and a CT 
torso showed severe pneumonia with very little residual aerated 
lung volume. 
On ___ she was begun on CVVH for acidosis and had increased 
pressor requirement with the addition of vasopressin. We 
continued to transfuse RBC/FFP/cryo to maintain blood levels.
On ___ she had increased pressor requirement and markedly 
increased oral bleeding. It was estimated she bleed 600cc 
periorally this day. Transfusions continued and she remained on 
high dose levo/vaso, though her pressor requirement was slightly 
less than the day prior. A family meeting was held. It was 
decided she would not want to be on full life support for more 
than 5 days. As it had been 3 days to this point, we decided to 
make a final decision ___ unless she acutely worsened.
On ___, the day of her death, she acutely worsened during the 
day. She became hypotensive despite increasing her pressor 
doses. Melena and oral bleeding increased and she grew 
increasingly tachycardic. She was not responding hemodynamically 
to significant product transfusion, and her ventilator settings 
were increased with more oxygen needed. Another family meeting 
was held and we discussed that she was decompensating rapidly 
and likely had an unsurvivable condition. The family present was 
receptive and understanding. She was transitioned to comfort 
care at 7pm, though the endotracheal tube was left in to prevent 
aspirating blood which we felt would cause her too much 
discomfort. She was started on a morphine drip. Her heart rate 
and blood pressure gradually declined and asystole occured at 
9:28pm. She was declared at 9:30pm. The family declined an 
autopsy.

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 69-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure. She has a history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and encephalopathy, and is currently on the transplant list. She was recently discharged from another hospital where she was admitted for abdominal distension, and was directly admitted to this hospital for acute renal failure. The patient's past medical history includes schistosomiasis complicated by cirrhosis and ascites, hypertension, IDDM, dyslipidemia, and nephrolithiasis.

The patient's allergies include aspirin. She has a history of bleeding, including a recent episode of hematochezia and melena, and has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome. She has also been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and has required oxygen therapy.

The patient's medications at discharge include midodrine and octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome, and rifaximin and lactulose for prophylaxis against hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient underwent several procedures during her hospital stay, including a diagnostic paracentesis, which ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and an EGD with feeding tube placement and duodenal polyp biopsy. She also underwent a TTE, which showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, including ALT, AST, and LDH, as well as elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Her creatinine level was elevated at 2.0 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was elevated at 28 mg/dL. Her albumin level was low at 3.7 g/dL, and her calcium level was elevated at 9.8 mg/dL.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was complicated by her underlying liver disease and acute renal failure, and she required multiple interventions to manage her symptoms and stabilize her condition. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Urinary retention - POD1 foley removed and patient unable to 
void, straight cath x 1, failed voiding trial again, foley 
replaced POD1 eve and removed again on POD3, voising trial 
pending.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the 
surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without 
erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.
 
She is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness and incoordination
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endobronchial biopsy of right and left lung nodules

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with a history of
prostate CA s/p radiation, hyperlipidemia, cervical spine
disease, and longstanding tobacco use who presents with left
sided weakness and incoordination over the last 10 days. He
reports that he had ""the flu"" about 6 weeks ago with URI 
symptoms
and muscle aches. This resolved, but then about 2 weeks ago he
began to have muscle aches again that felt very similar. These
started in his left quadriceps and then spread over the next
several days to involve his bilateral quadriceps, calves, and
triceps as well. He saw his PCP ___ ___ for his annual physical
and then again on ___ due to the persistent myalgias. At that
point he had also begun to experience intermittent vertigo as
well. This was only present with movement such as turning his
head or standing up to walk and resolved completely at rest. He
describes it as a brief sensation of spinning or movement 
lasting
seconds. CK and ESR were checked due to the myalgias and were
negative. His vertigo was felt to be most likely peripheral.
Basic labs were all normal and he was advised to monitor his
symptoms. 

However over the next week his vertigo persisted, still only
brought on by movement, and he also began to notice weakness in
his left arm and leg. He initially attributed this to the muscle
aches, which ultimately resolved on the right but have still
persisted a little in his left quad and triceps. However over 
the
last week he has also noticed that it is more difficult to
control his left arm and leg. He says they feel weak but also
clumsy, and his arm ""flops around"" when he tries to use it. His
wife says he also veers toward the left when he walks, and his
left leg has ""given out"" on him a couple of times. He has fallen
twice in the last week, once when getting out of the car and 
then
again yesterday when he was trying to help his wife make up the
bed. Both times his left leg just seemed to buckle and he fell 
to
the ground, sustaining some scrapes but no significant injuries.
Last night he was playing cards with his friends, which he has
done for ___ years, and realized that he couldn't hold the cards
or shuffle with his left hand. At this point he became 
concerned,
as he says one of his other friends in the group had a stroke a
few years ago with very similar symptoms. He therefore went back
to Dr. ___ this morning, and on exam he was found to
have left sided weakness and ataxia and was sent to the ED for
further evaluation.

In addition he also reports one episode of headache last week on
___, around the time that he first noticed the left sided
weakness. He describes the headache as bifrontal pressure with 
no
other associated symptoms. This was a bit unusual for him as he
does not typically get headaches but it resolved on its own and
has not recurred. He also noticed brief blurring of vision in 
his
left eye around the same time which also lasted for about a day
and then resolved. He denies any diplopia or loss of vision. He
reports that he has chronic tingling in his left arm and hand 
due
to an ulnar nerve injury many years ago, but this has seemed a
bit more prominent lately than usual. He denies any numbness or
tingling in his face or leg. He denies any problems with his
speech.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, diplopia, 
dysarthria,
dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech. No bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills (since his flu-like illness 6 weeks ago).  No night 
sweats
or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of 
breath.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

PATHOLOGY: 
- Lung biopsies (___): ***PATHOLOGY PENDING***

STUDIES: 

- NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT (___): Findings concerning for multiple 
intracranial lesions which raises suspicion for metastatic 
disease.  Correlate with history of malignancy. MRI would be 
helpful for further evaluation. 

- CTA HEAD/NECK (___):  
1. Three distinct heterogeneously-enhancing parenchymal lesions, 
with cystic necrosis, within the superior cerebellar vermis, and 
the left frontal and parietal lobe, worrisome for metastatic 
disease. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
2. Mild effacement of the left ambient cistern. 
3. 2.7 cm soft tissue mass within the azygos lobe with an 
associated 3.2 cm necrotic precarinal lymph node which may 
represent primary bronchogenic neoplasm with metastatic 
lymphadenopathy. 
4. Patent vasculature. No aneurysm, dissection, or stenosis. 

- MRI BRAIN W/WO GAD (___): 
1. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior frontal and left 
medial 
occipital regions, which may be leptomeningeal or superficial 
cortical, 
without significant mass effect. Punctate left superior frontal 
cortical 
metastasis adjacent to the larger left frontal metastasis. 
2. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior cerebellar vermis 
and left 
cerebellar hemisphere. The dominant metastasis in the left 
cerebellar vermis effaces the left ambient cistern with 
deformation of the left inferior colliculus. It also partially 
effaces the fourth ventricle without obstructive hydrocephalus. 
3. 4 mm enhancing lesion in the superior right aspect of the 
occipital bone, corresponding to a lytic lesion with erosion of 
the outer table on the prior CT, indicating an osseous 
metastasis. 
  
COMMENT: The appearance of the intracranial and calvarial 
lesions is more suggestive of metastatic disease from the right 
apical pulmonary mass seen on the preceding CTA, than from 
prostate cancer, but tissue diagnosis is needed. 

CT ___ W CONTRAST (___):  
1. Multiple enlarged low-attenuation mediastinal lymph nodes and 
right hilar lymph node. A 1.4 cm subpleural nodule in the right 
upper lobe. Adjacent to/contiguous with the necrotic right upper 
paratracheal lymph node. Multiple pulmonary nodules identified 
measuring up to 5 mm. Findings are suspicious of pulmonary and 
nodal metastases. The mediastinal lymph nodes are amenable for 
biopsy via bronchoscopy. 
2. A 1.5 cm and 1.6 cm hypodense lesions in segment 2 and 4B 
nonspecific but suspicious for hepatic metastasis, especially 
segment 4B lesion. 
3. 3.5 cm solid lesion identified posterior to the left psoas 
muscle, 
suspicious for metastasis. This lesion is amenable for biopsy 
under CT 
guidance, if necessary. 
4. Enlarged necrotic lymph nodes at the left external iliac and 
left common iliac chain, suspicious for nodal metastases. 
5. Cholelithiasis. Small hiatal hernia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo RH M with a history of prostate CA s/p radiation, 
hyperlipidemia, cervical spine disease, and tobacco use who 
presents with left sided weakness and incoordination over the 
last 10 days. In the ED, head CT showed 3 lesions with central 
hemorrhage/necrosis and vasogenic edema in the left frontal 
lobe, left parietal lobe, and most notably in the left 
cerebellar vermis coming close to impinging on the ___ 
ventricle, with no hydrocephalus. CTA head/neck incidentally 
revealed a mass in the right upper lung with adjacent necrotic 
lymph nodes. The findings were highly concerning for metastatic 
cancer. 

# HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Neurology service for 
further workup. MRI brain confirmed presence of hemorrhagic 
metastases in the left frontal and parietal lobes and left 
cerebellar hemisphere with small amount of vasogenic edema. CT 
torso revealed multiple lesions concerning for metastatic cancer 
-- enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, 1.4cm RUL nodule and 
multiple other pulmonary nodules, 2 liver lesions, solid lesion 
posterior to the left psoas, and enlarged necrotic left iliac 
lymph nodes. Given his smoking history and distribution of the 
lesions, findings were highly suspicious for metastatic lung 
cancer. 

The next day an endobronchial biopsy of the right lung and LNs 
was obtained by Interventional Pulmonology (results pending on 
discharge). Hematology-Oncology, Neuro-Oncology, Neurosurgery 
and Radiation Oncology services consulted for workup and 
planning. Given the size of the cerebellar mass and its close 
proximity to the ___ ventricle, it was felt that patient would 
need whole brain radiation (fractionated radiotherapy to the 
area would cause too much swelling and thus hydrocephalus, and 
surgical resection would be unsafe given his age and 
comorbidities). After much debate, it was decided that he needed 
EVD placed before beginning whole brain XRT since risk for 
subsequent edema and hydrocephalus was still high. This will be 
performed one week after discharge, on ___ -- 
patient will be called beforehand with time and name of 
neurosurgeon doing the procedure. Following EVD placement, he 
will see Radiation Oncology (Dr. ___ in clinic to begin 
planning for whole-brain radiation. They anticipate beginning 
XRT one week after surgery in order to allow superficial wound 
healing. 

Patient was started on Dexamethasone 4mg qAM (with GI 
prophylaxis) in the hospital for additional for additional 
protection against vasogenic edema. He was also given oxycodone 
on discharge for left hip pain caused by metastases to the area, 
which cause him significant discomfort. 

At the time of discharge, results of the lung biopsy are still 
pending. Once they return, Heme-Onc will coordinate follow up 
and planning for systemic therapy in the appropriate clinic 
(most likely Thoracic Oncology, given high suspicion that this 
is lung cancer). 

Patient was seen by Social Work in the hospital to address 
coping with his new diagnosis and for assistance obtaining 
long-term disability and transportation to future appointments 
at ___. 

====================

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Masses in brain, lungs, liver and inguinal lymph nodes 
concerning for metastatic cancer 

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Neuro exam = dysmetria on left FNF, incoordination of fine

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for new clumsiness and 
weakness on the left side of your body. An MRI of your brain 
showed 3 masses concerning for metastatic cancer, one of which 
was in an area called the CEREBELLUM and carries a high risk for 
causing brain cancer (HYDROCEPHALUS). A subsequent CT scan of 
your torso showed masses in your lymph nodes, lungs and liver 
also concerning for cancer. A lung biopsy was performed, results 
pending. 

The next step in your care will be to start whole brain 
radiation. Before this, you will need a ventriculo-peritoneal 
(VP) shunt. This will be done on ___. You will 
be called by the Neurosurgery apartment with the name of the 
surgeon who will perform the operation and the time of surgery. 

Approximately 3 days after shunt placement, you should attend 
your follow-up appointment with Radiation Oncology. They will 
coordination your radiation plan, as well as your follow-up 
appointments with Neuro-Oncology (___). You will be 
called by them to schedule this appointment in the next few 
days.

You are scheduled for an outpatient with Medical Oncology (Dr. 
___ on ___ to discuss the results of your lung 
biopsy, which should have returned by them. See below for more 
info. They will plan your systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or 
radiation) once the lung biopsy results have returned. 

We made the following changes to your medications: 
1. STARTED Dexamethasone (Decadron) 4mg by mouth in AM -- this 
is to treat swelling of the brain due to cancer. 
2. STARTED Famotidine 20mg twice daily -- this is to prevent 
acid reflux caused by Decadron. 
3. STARTED Oxycodone 2.5-5mg every 6 hrs as needed for pain -- 
side effects include nausea and constipation. Can take over the 
counter laxative as needed.
4. STARTED Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg every 8 hrs as needed for 
nausea -- if experienced as side effect of oxycodone. 
 
Followup Instructions:

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ male with history of renal transplant in ___ who 
presents with subacute kidney injury.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury - 
The patient was admitted with a Cr of 5.3. Renal U/S showed 
moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis, which had worsened over the 
past year. FeNa was 5.5%. Urine culture negative on two 
occasions. The patient had good urine output. A Cudet foley 
catheter was placed with good return. Both Urology and 
transplant nephrology were involved in the case. The etiology of 
the renal failure was thought to be multifactorial: ATN ___ 
recent illness with significant nausea/vomiting during which 
time he continued to take Lasix and losartan with obstructive 
component because the patient had stopped taking terazosin. The 
patient's Cr did not improve during ___ hospitalization. His K, 
which was intially 5.2 responded to Kayexelate and his potassium 
was stable throughout the admission. A repeat renal ultrasound 
showed progression of the hydronephrosis despite a foley 
catheter in place with good return. Cystogram showed a dilated 
collecting system but no ureteral stricture. The patient was 
discharged with a foley in place and urology follow-up the 
following week. He was also discharged to have his renal lytes 
rechecked and with close nephrology follow-up. Terazosin was 
restarted. Lasix and losartan were stopped with the patient to 
take lasix only every ___ day. 
.
# Hypertension- The patient had persistent hypertension during 
this admission. Losartan was held given acute kidney injury. The 
patient was continued on his home diltiazem and nadolol. 
Hydralazine 25 mg tid was started with good response. 
.
# S/p renal transplant- The patient's immunosuppressive regimen 
with prednisone 4 mg qday and imuran 50 mg qday was contiued as 
was calcitriol.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin. 
.
# GERD
- continude PPI
.
# BPH- Thought to have contributed to acute kidney injury. 
Terazosin 3 mg bid was started to be uptitrated as an 
outpatient. The patient was discharged with a foley in place and 
urology follow-up. 
.
# ___- patient has had over 4000 lesions removed. Outpatient 
follow-up with dermatology
.
# DVT prophylaxis with subQ heparin. The patient remained full 
code throughout this admission. Contact was with the patient's

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___ - 
___ was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for acute kidney failure. We 
placed a foley to help decompress your bladder and kidney 
collecting system. We performed 2 ultrasound studies of your 
kidneys, which both showed swelling and dilation of your kidney 
collecting system. We also performed a cystogram, that did not 
show any damage to the connection between your kidney and 
bladder. Your renal failure was likely caused by a combination 
of medications, dehydration from your recent illness, and 
possibly from an enlarged prostate. You will go home with a 
foley catheter from the hospital and will see a urologist next 
___ to have this foley removed. You will see Dr. ___ 
___ ___. We also started you on a medication to treat your 
enlarged prostate.

We made the following changes to your medications: 
We changed Lasix to 40 mg every ___ day. 
We changed Gabapentin (Neurontin) to 300 mg each day because of 
your renal function
We STOPPED Cozaar (Losartan). You may be told to restart this 
medication once your kidney function returns to normal. 
We STARTED terazosin 3 mg twice per day for your prostate.
We STARTED hydralazine 25 mg three times per day for high blood 
pressure (this will likely be stopped once you can restart 
Cozaar). 
We STOPPED ciprofloxacin.
. 
It is also very important that you have your renal function labs 
performed on this ___ to be sure there is no

SUMMARY STATEMENT
====================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with PMHx High grade lymphoma 
with burkitt's features s/p cycle 6 R-EPOCH, HTN, HLD, DM, and 
gout who presents with abdominal bloating and weight loss at 
home, found to have refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
confirmed on gastric biopsy, initiated on RICE therapy. His 
course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, ___, and one 
episode of hematuria. Problems addressed during his 
hospitalization are as follows:

#Recurrent Burkitts-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
Patient with high grade lymphoma with Burkitt like features 
refractory to 6 cycles of EPOCH-R therapy last given ___. 
Previously had IGH/MYC rearrangement and no evidence of BCL2 or 
BCL6 rearrangements. Initially presented with weight loss and 
abdominal bloating, CT AP demonstrating gastric thickening s/p 
EGD with biopsy demonstrating high grade B-cell lymphoma (CD20, 
CD10 positive; CD5 negative; ___ ISH negative; Ki-67 
proliferation index near 100%). Subsequent FISH and cytogenetics 
demonstrating pending. Initiated ICE therapy Cycle 1 
___ with rituximab administration ___. 
Received filgrastim ___. Initiated acyclovir for 
prophylaxis. Developed ___ likely in setting of Ifosfamide 
administration (see ___ below), otherwise tolerated with no 
issues. 

#Febrile neutropenia:
Tmax ___, otherwise remained afebrile, no source of 
infection identified. No localizing symptoms other than nasal 
erythema suspicious for HSV which he has had in the past, 
however on acyclovir, improved. CXR clear, elevation in alk phos 
(most likely medication effect), PICC line without suspicion for 
infection, no evidence of cellulitis, fungal markers negative, 
blood and urine cultures negative. Completed 7 day course of IV 
cefepime, discontinued when ___>500 over 3 days.

___:
Cr elevated over several days (Cr peak 2.1; baseline 1.1-1.2). 
Etiology most likely ATN supported by urine with fragmented 
granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells. Likely 
developed kidney injury from large volume autodiuresis (up to 
-3.5L over 24H) and medication effect causing tubular injury 
(Ifosfamide). Cr normalized with IVF to keep net fluid balance 
even. Given sodium bicarbonate for acidosis. Of note, in ___ 
developed tumor lysis syndrome at outside hospital (Cr peak 8.4, 
UA 515), renal biopsy with ATN/AIN requiring temporary dialysis. 


#Hematuria with blood clots:
Reported blood clot in urine x1, otherwise asymptomatic. UA 
unremarkable with no evidence of hematuria x2. Resolved 
spontaneously with no intervention. Possibly from ifosfamide 
administration, of note also has bladder mass on CT performed at 
___.

#Guaiac positive stool:
Intermittent melena on admission, resolved with initiation of 
PPI. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#Anemia:
Hg ___, likely due to lymphoma and bone marrow suppression from 
chemotherapy. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#HTN:
In setting of ATN and large volume autidiuresis, reduced home 
labetalol(decreased from 300 to 200 BID) and home amlodipine 
(decreased from 10 to 5 QD). Remained normotensive with this 
dose reduction.

#Gout: 
Continued home allopurinol

#DM:
Continued home NPH 7 qAM, and ISS, held home glyburide

#Moderate malnutrition:
On presentation reported 3.6% weight loss over 2 weeks. Received 
glucerna BID in between meals.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
[] continue to monitor weight [weight at discharge: 68.3 kg, 
weight at admission: 71.35 kg]
[] continue to monitor hematuria, melena 
[] consider initiation of SSRI

The patient is a ___ year old gentleman with a history of AVR and 
aortic aneurysm repair, L CFA-axillary bypass graft ___ and R 
femoral to axillary bypass PFTE graft ___ admitted with right 
groin wound dehiscence and S. anginosus and MSSA bacteremia with 
course c/b rupture of a mycotic aneurysm at his femoral graft 
site. 

VASCULAR: Right groin wound was packed, and patient was started 
on vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl and admitted to the vascular 
surgery service. Admission blood cultures grew strep anginosus 
and wound swab was polymicrobial including MSSA and e Coli. CT 
angiogram was concerning for infection at the site of bypass 
graft anastamosis with the femoral artery. ID was consulted, who 
recommended transition to Zosyn. Pt was then pre-oped and 
consented for surgery for infected right femoral axillary 
bypass. Coumadin was stopped in preperation of surgery. He was 
on a heparin drip for his mechanical valve. 

CTA: 
  
1. Widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with 
minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the 
bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site. Although, 
no drainable 
fluid collections or abscesses are seen, this would be 
concerning for 
infection in the presence of clinical symptoms. 
  
2. Stable appearance of the ascending thoracic aortic graft and 
widely patent 
left axillary to femoral bypass graft. Normal appearance of the 
abdominal 
aorta and its major visceral branches. 
  
3. Unchanged appearance of an isodense right lower pole renal 
lesion and 
multiple indeterminate left renal lesions since the earlier 
study. These can 
be further evaluated by renal CTA protocol if this has not 
evaluated before. 

He was taken to the OR after developing several small bleeds 
from his operative site concerning for herald bleeds from a 
ruptured aneurysm. In the OR on ___ he was found to have fresh 
clotted blood at his femoral graft site with concern for a 
disrupted femoral anastomosis. He was found to have inflammatory 
changes in his retroperitoneum and a large inflammatory phlegmon 
at his rectus. The distal portion of his axillofemoral graft was 
detached and a saphenous vein graft was placed. 

___ - Exploration of right groin, control of the external iliac 
artery via a retroperitoneal exposure, excision of distal 
portion of the axillary-femoral bypass,
and vein patch repair of the femoral artery with saphenous vein 
patch.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

Due to his massive bleeding and transfusion requirements, he 
developed abdominal compartment syndrome overnight and was taken
