who presents with cough and shortness of breath
.  
#  Cough- Patient was recently admitted with similar symptoms at 
___ and was discharged with a course of augmentin and 
doxycycline for CAP, which she completed.  However, prior to 
admission, she developed cough associated with shortness of 
breath so she presented to ___.   In the ED, she was febrile 
with possible early pneumonia on CXR, so she received a dose of 
ceftriaxone.  Given that her WBC was normal, and cough was 
non-productive, the patient was not initially treated for HCAP.  
In addition, she has presented like this in the past and was 
treated for a COPD exacerbation.  On admission, she was started 
on azithromycin, prednisone 60mg daily and nebulizers.  Her 
symptoms improved and oxygen requirement was decreasing.  
However, she developed a fever on ___ so she was started on 
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, given recent hospital 
discharge.  She was weaned off oxygen and worked well with 
physical therapy.  Urine legionella was negative.  Blood and 
urine cultures were negative.  Sputum culture was contaminated 
with normal respiratory flora.  The patient completed an 8 day 
course of antibiotics- vancomycin 1gm q48hours, Cefepime 1g q24 
hours via ___ line.  She is being discharged on a prednisone 
taper starting at 30mg daily.  On discharge, cough, shortness of 
breath and oxygen requirement had resolved.  She was able to 
ambulate with no shortness of breath.  The patient was afebrile 
from ___ until discharge, had a normal WBC count and looked 
well.  
.  
#  Fever- Likely secondary to pneumonia.  She lacked other 
symptoms of influenza (myalgias, etc).  Patient's cultures were 
negative.  UA was negative for UTI.  
.
#  COPD- Patient improved with azithromycin, nebulizers and 
steroids.  She was weaned off oxygen and is being discharged on 
a prednisone taper, starting at 30mg daily for 14 additional 
days of therapy
.  
#  Atrial fibrillation- Continued home amiodarone and 
metoprolol.  Heart rate was regular and was well-controlled.  
Her INR trended up to 4.3 so she was cut down from 2mg 3x/week 
to 0.5 or 1.0mg daily (pending INR) given that she is on 
antibiotics and amiodarone.  As mentioned, her INR peaked at 4.3 
but then trended down.  We resumed her at 2mg daily on ___ 
when INR was 1.7.  Subsequent trend was 1.7 -> 1.5 -> 1.6.  She 
received 2mg of coumadin on ___.  We have 
instructed her to resume her prior regimen on discharge meaning 
she will take 2mg on ___ and 1mg on ___.  We also asked the 
patient to have an INR check on ___ and to please fax the 
results to her PCP for instruction on management of coumadin 
dosing.  
.  
#  Diastolic CHF- The patient has a known history of chronic 
diastolic heart failure.  On admission, there were no signs of 
fluid overload on exam.  Her oxygen requirement was attributed 
to pneumonia and COPD exerbation.  Given her elevated creatinine 
on admission, her lasix and lisinopril were initially held.  Her 
creatinine improved so we resumed her lisinopril at 20mg daily.  
By discharge, we resumed home dose of lisinopril.  Once 
creatinine stabilized, home dose of lasix was resumed and 
patient's creatinine remained stable.  She was discharged on 
home dose of lasix 20mg daily and has ___ with Dr. ___ 
on ___.
.
#  CAD- The patient did not present with chest pain.  Her EKGs 
were consistent with prior.  She was continued on her home 
statin and beta-blocker.  
.
#  Hypertension- As mentioned above, her lisinopril was 
initially held given ___ but was resumed at home dose by 
discharge.  She was continued on the remainder of her home 
medications- imdur 30mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg daily.  BP's were remained stable. 
.
#  Numbness- On the last day of admission, patient revealed to 
us that she had been experiencing numbness in her fingertips 
(all of them).  Exam did not demonstrate any sensory or motor 
deficit as patient has ___ strength in all 4 extremities with 
intact sensation bilaterally.  She is not a diabetic.  Other 
possible etiologies include b12 deficiency, radiculopathy, or 
vasculitis.  Given that her symptoms are in both hands with only 
the DIP joint affected, a cervical radiculopathy is unlikely.  
She has no other systemic symptoms suggestive of vasculitis 
(skin changes, fever, chills) and her labwork is benign.  No 
indication for imaging as remainder of neurological exam is 
intact, including gait.  This also could be due to a medication 
as she received IV antibiotics.  B12 level checked and pending 
at the time of discharge, but, given description of symptoms, 
will likely not be the etiology behind this numbness.  We ask 
that the patient's PCP ___ on this issue when she sees the 
patient on ___.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ y/o M with extensive vascular history who 
presented with chest pain and anemia. Transferred to MICU due to 
concern of demand ischemia in setting of LGIB.  

#Chest Pain - The patient has an extensive coronary history. His 
present episode of chest pain ocurred in the setting of 
tachycardia to the 160s (reported by EMS) and a hematocrit below 
his baseline. Given pt's EKG and clinical picture, the elevated 
troponin was most likely demand ischemia. He was given packed 
RBCs to increase oxygen supply for increased demand.   A CHF 
exacerbation despite an elevated BNP, but unclear likely given 
clear lungs and no fluid overload on CXR.  Other etiologies 
including PE was considered but his INR was supratherepeutic and 
pt was not hypoxic. Cardiology was consulted and did not believe 
that this was ACS and did not recommend coronary angiography.

# Anemia - The patient has a long history of anemia and has 
known history of gastric erosions, but no ulcers, and 
diverticuli. CT Abdomen this month has no evidence of 
malignancy. Pt is presently on iron supplementation. Guaiac (+) 
stool in ED and on the floor. Pt was transfused several units of 
RBCs (followed by lasix) to maintain a goal of hct>30 for demand 
ischemia. 
 
# A. Fib - CHADS2 score of 4. The patient presented in afib with 
a rate in the 110s, and hemodynamically stable. Pt may have had 
an episode of NSVT with EMS before arriving to ED since he had 
SVT during last admission. No SVT episodes during ICU course. Pt 
was continued on metoprolol with rates maintained below 100, 
until the patient developed the GI bleed.  Metoprolol was held 
given blood pressures in 90/50 and his heart rate was well 
controlled without it.  Given his GI bleed, his coumadin and 
metoprolol were held at the time of discharge.

#. C.diff colitis- The patient was found to have C. diff colitis 
and started on metronidazole on ___.  He will need to 
complete 14 days of metronidazole.
 
# PVD - Patient with PVD leading to ulcerations. Patient with 
stent placed recently and it was of high priority that he 
continued anti-platelet and AC with plavix and warfarin at 
present. With pt's GI bleed, vascular team was amenable to 
discontinuing Plavix. Wound care team followed pt throughout 
course.

# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease - Cr elevated to 2.0 on 
admission. Also with BUN elevation to suggest pre-renal state. 
___ also be due to renal vein congestion in the setting of CHF. 
After receiving blood products, his Cr improved and was 1.4 at 
the time of discharge.

# sCHF/CAD - Worsening EF thought to be due to progressive CAD. 
It was imperative to give blood/fluid slowly and diurese as 
needed. CXR and lungs presently clear with absent JVD on my 
exam. Pt's home torsemide was held.  The statin and ACE 
inhibitor were restarted by the time of discharge.  The patient 
should follow up with his cardiology within ___ weeks after 
discharge to assess the need to restart his torsemide.
 
# Delirium - Had difficulty with sundowning on prior admission. 
Seen by ___ consult and was started on zyprexa PRN agitation at 
night.

# DMII: Pt's home metformin was hekd and BG were monitored four 
times a day.  He was discharge on an Insulin sliding scale.

Transitional issues:
- Reassesment regarding restarting Coumadin, metoprolol and 
torsemide
- F/u with his PCP ___ 1 week of discharge from rehab
- F/u with his cardiology within ___ weeks of discharge from the 
hospital

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for 
chest pain.  We don't believe you had a heart attack, but the 
chest pain was likely related to lower oxygen to your heart.  
You are now chest pain free after receiving blood.  

We also found that you had a bleed within your gastrointestional 
system.  You underwent endoscopy, in otherword we looked with a 
camera at your gastrointestion system, which did not find the 
source of your bleeding.  We have stopped your plavix and 
currently stopping your coumadin after discharge.  We have also 
stopped your torsemide and metoprolol given lower blood 
pressure.  You should follow up with your cardiology and 
determine if you should restart the torsemide, metoprolol, and 
coumadin.  

We also found that you had an infection of your colon caused by 
a bacteria, clostridium difficle.  You will need to take 
antibiotics to treat this infection.

Finally, it is important that you rebuild your strength after 
discharge at the rehab extended care facility.

We are stopping your torsemide and metoprolol given your recent 
GI bleed.  Please talk with your cardiology about restarting 
metoprolol, torsemide and coumadin within ___ weeks of 
discharge.  Also, please see your primary care doctor within 1 
week of discharge from rehab.

Imaging:

R Ankle XR ___:
IMPRESSION: 
 
Extensive chronic, partially postoperative changes without 
definite evidence
of osteomyelitis.  Please note that MRI is more sensitive for 
early
osteomyelitis.
No evidence of hardware failure.

CT RLE ___:
IMPRESSION: 
 
1.  Findings worrisome for calcaneal ulcer with associated 
phlegmon.  Doubt
drainable fluid collection.  However, no IV contrast was 
administered to
confirm the presence of a fluid collection.
2.  No CT findings pathognomic for osteomyelitis, but the 
presence of early
osteomyelitis in the setting of these advanced bony changes 
would be difficult
to exclude.
3.  Status post hindfoot fusion and resection of the distal 
fibula.  No
hardware loosening or failure detected in the hindfoot.  The 
anterior portion
of the talus is absent and a fibular graft is noted in the 
resection bed.
4.  Advanced bony disruption in the midfoot, compatible with 
Charcot
osteoarthropathy.  Of note, bony fragments are seen in the 
region of the
tarsal tunnel.
4.  2 pins within distal first metatarsal osteotomy.  Status 
post osseous
fusion of first IP joint, with screw across the joint.
5.  Diffuse subcutaneous edema along dorsum of foot.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  If persistent concern for osteomyelitis 
consider tagged
WBC and sulfur colloid study for further evaluation.  Of note MR 
is more
sensitive in the detection of acute osteomyelitis however given 
adjacent
hardware MR evaluation will LIKELY be limited.

Pathology of Bedside bone bx ___: 
Fibro-purulent exudate with associated fragments of necrotic 
bone. 

CXR ___:
In comparison with study of ___, there again are low lung 
volumes that
accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette seen on the 
image from an
outside facility.  No definite vascular congestion or acute 
focal pneumonia.
There is an placement of a right subclavian PICC line, the tip 
of which is
very difficult to identify.  Oblique view or a repeat radiograph 
using
abdominal technique could be obtained to ascertain the position 
of the tip.

CXR ___:
FINDINGS: 
 
The right PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There 
is no focal
consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or 
pneumothorax.  The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Right PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  No acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

Thank you for choosing to receive your care at ___. You were 
admitted for an infection in the bone of your R food. You were 
started on antibiotic therapy to treat this infection. You 
underwent exploratory surgery on the foot, which confirmed the 
infection but was unable to remove any hardware present in your 
foot. We took a sample of the infected bone, which may help us 
tailor your antibiotics moving forward. In the meantime, while 
those results are coming back, you should continue to take IV 
antibiotics at a rehab facility. 

You should otherwise continue to take your medications as listed 
below, and attend the follow up appointments listed below. 

We wish you the best with your ongoing recovery

Sincerely, 

Your ___ care team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with ankle swelling and drainage. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, colon cancer, cirrhosis, and atrial fibrillation. He was previously admitted to another hospital for the same condition and was discharged home with plans to follow up in clinic. However, he developed increased swelling and low-grade fever, and was referred to the current hospital for admission.

The patient's allergies include erythromycin base. He has a history of MRSA infection and was previously treated with vancomycin and doxycycline. He was prescribed lasix to increase his dosage due to swelling, and also took a leftover prescription of dicloxacillin at home.

The patient's diagnosis is mixed bacterial flora, including Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to oxacillin, erythromycin, and other antibiotics. He underwent bedside bone biopsy, which showed fibro-purulent exudate with associated fragments of necrotic bone.

The patient underwent imaging studies, including X-ray and CT scans, which showed chronic changes in the ankle without evidence of osteomyelitis. However, the CT scan did show findings worrisome for calcaneal ulcer with associated phlegmon.

The patient's medications at discharge include lasix and other antibiotics. ||endoftext||"

IMAGING:

___ CT head without contrast
1.  Left temporal bone fracture spares the otic capsule but 
extends 
posteriorly to involve the left occipital bone.   Underlying 
left occipital epidural hematoma containing several foci of air. 

2.  Bilateral subdural hematomas (left greater than right) and 
anterior 
parafalcine subdural hemorrhage. 
3.  Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
4.  Left temporal and probable anterior inferior left frontal 
contusions. 
5.  3 mm right-sided shift of normally midline structures. 

___ CT chest, abdomen, pelvis with contrast
1.  Hemoperitoneum adjacent to the posterior and inferior edge 
of the liver with high-density stranding in the gallbladder 
fossa and the porta hepatis.  Although hypoattenuating linear 
streak artifact from the right arm limits evaluation, linear 
hypodensity in the periphery of segment IVb is suspicious for a 
laceration.  The study can be repeated with the right arm up if 
more detail is desired. 
2.  Two small subcentimeter hypodensities in the periphery of 
the inferior edge of the spleen with adjacent small amount of 
blood are suspicious for small lacerations. 
3.  Acute right anterolateral ___ through 7th rib fractures. 
4.  Mild compression deformities of T11 and T12 vertebral bodies 
are likely chronic. 

___ CT head without contrast
1.  Left occipital epidural hematoma underlying the calvarial 
fracture is 
stable in size.  Small, left greater than right subdural 
hematomas are stable in size. 
2.  Left greater than right subarachnoid hemorrhage has 
increased in extent.  
There is no associated increase in mass effect. 
3.  Complex, comminuted left temporal bone fracture, which 
extends into the tegmen tympani and middle ear cavity.  Middle 
and inner ear structures may be better assessed by dedicated 
temporal bone CT.  The fracture also extends into and widens the 
temporal/occipital and occipital/parietal sutures. 

___ Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is 
a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function with 
mild resting outflow tract obstruction. No significant valvular 
disease.  

___ ECG
Marked sinus bradycardia competing with a junctional escape. No 
previous 
tracing available for comparison.  
  
  Intervals Axes 
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 
44 124 96 490/462 54 21 56 
 
___ KUB
Multiple distended loops of small bowel are present, 
particularly 
in the mid abdomen, with maximal transverse ___ of up to 
5.4 cm.  Air is also observed throughout non-distended loops of 
colon.  On the decubitus view, multiple air-fluid levels are 
seen in both large and small bowel.  Observed findings could 
potentially represent an ileus, but short-term followup 
radiographs are recommended to exclude early or partial 
small-bowel obstruction.  Tip of nasogastric tube terminates in 
the proximal stomach, but a side port could potentially be above 
the GE junction, and a dedicated chest x-ray may be helpful to 
better determine the location of the side port if warranted 
clinically. 

___ LUE films
SHOULDER:  There are no signs for acute fractures or 
dislocations.  There are degenerative changes of the AC and 
glenohumeral joints.  There are healed left fourth and fifth rib 
fractures. 
  
LEFT HUMERUS:  No acute fractures or dislocations are seen.  
Mineralization is normal. 
  
LEFT FOREARM:  There is a fracture plate in the distal radius 
shaft.  There are no signs for acute fractures.  There is a 
corticated density adjacent to the lateral aspect of the distal 
humeral epicondyle.  This may represent sequela of old trauma or 
a supracondylar spur.  A lucency is seen at the base of the 
spur.  There is no elbow joint effusion.  There is spurring 
about the olecranon at the triceps tendon attachment. 
  
LEFT WRIST:  There are no acute fractures or dislocations.  
There are severe degenerative changes of the first CMC, 
triscaphe, and radiocarpal joints. Distal radioulnar joint 
demonstrates spurring.  Peripheral IV catheter is identified.  
There is a well-corticated density at the radial aspect of the 
wrist joint. 
  
___ ___ Doppler Study
Left basilic vein thrombus.  The basilic vein is a superficial 
vein.

___ Renal U/S
Limited views of the bilateral kidneys demonstrate the right 
kidney measures 
12 cm, and the left kidney measures 12.3 cm.  There is no 
evidence of 
hydronephrosis or large renal mass bilaterally.  No perinephric 
fluid 
collections are present.  There is no evidence of renal stones 
bilaterally.  
Renal echogenicity and corticomedullary architecture is within 
normal limits.  
  
  
Due to the limited nature of this study secondary to patient 
motion, 
acceleration times and peak systolic velocities of the main 
renal arteries are not well evaluated, however there is 
demonstration of bilateral renal vascular flow with diastolic 
flow. Resistive indices on the right range from 0.47 to 0.56 and 
on the left range from 0.61 to 0.7.  The main renal arteries are 
patent bilaterally. The renal veins are patent bilaterally.   
Prior CT shows left renal artery stent. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
Motion limited study. Arterial flow to both kidneys, as above.  
  
___ CT head without contrast
1. Multiple new hypodense areas is scattered throughout the 
brain concerning for embolic infarcts, possibly subacute. 
Recommend MRI for further evaluation. 
2. Expected evolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage which is now 
less dense 
compared to the prior study. Stable left occipital epidural 
hematoma and 
parafalcine subdural hematoma. No new hemorrhage.  

___ MRI brain w/o contrast
1. Combination of right watershed and right MCA territory 
infarcts, the latter both cortical and basal ganglia in 
distribution.  Considered in conjunction with diminished flow in 
right ICA, findings are most consistent with severe proximal 
stenosis likely due to unstable atherosclerotic plaque. 
2. Stable extra-axial hemorrhage as described above. 
3. Left frontal and temporal lobe contusions. 
4. Mastoid air cell and middle ear cavity fluid, consistent with 
known 
temporal bone fracture. 

___ EEG
EEG is recorded from 19:20 on ___ through 7 AM on ___. 
CONTINUOUS EEG: Background is slow and disorganized, with no 
posterior 
dominant rhythm or anterior-posterior gradient of frequencies. 
Predominant background activity is moderate voltage polymorphic 
theta and delta activity. There is continuous focal slowing over 
the left hemisphere, higher voltage polymorphic delta activity, 
most prominent in the left parasagittal region. 
SLEEP: No normal sleep architecture is present. 
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations. 
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are frequent automated spike 
detections, 
predominantly for electrode and movement artifact. There are no 
epileptiform discharges. 
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There is one automated seizure for 
electrode and movement artifact. There are no electrographic 
seizures. 
QUANTITATIVE EEG: Trend analysis is performed with Persyst Magic 
Marker 
software. Panels include automated seizure detection, rhythmic 
run detection and display, color spectral density array, 
absolute and relative asymmetry indices, asymmetry spectrogram, 
amplitude integrated EEG, burst suppression ratio, envelope 
trend, and alpha delta ratios. Segments showing abnormal trends 
are reviewed, and show diffuse delta activity, more prominent on 
the left. 
CARDIAC MONITOR: Shows a generally regular rhythm with an 
average rate of 
60-70 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of moderate diffuse background slowing, much worse on 
the left. These findings are indicative of moderate diffuse 
cerebral dysfunction, as well as focal cerebral dysfunction in 
the left hemisphere, and are consistent with the multiple 
regions of brain injury from trauma and multiple infarcts. No 
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present. 

___ CXR
In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much 
better inspiration.  Although the cardiac silhouette remains 
mildly enlarged and there is tortuosity of the aorta.  The 
pulmonary vascularity has substantially improved with only mild 
elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. 
The nasogastric tube is not well visualized.  No evidence of 
acute focal 
pneumonia. 

___ MRA neck w/ and w/o contrast
Marked irregularity and multifocal narrowing of the right 
internal carotid artery as well as the right vertebral artery

bilateral subdural and sub arachnoid hemorrhages (small) a left 
occipital epidural hematoma. His repeat head CT stable. Upon 
admission he was intubated and sedated, though he had a reported 
GCS of >8 in the field. On ___ the patient was extubated. 
Following extubation, he was increasingly agitated and started 
on PRN haldol for his agitation. On ___ the patient had a repeat 
head CT to evaluate for his diminishing mental status. 
Immediately following extubation he had been agitated though he 
would not open his eyes, he was moving all four extremities 
spastically, and he verbalized unintelligible speech. By ___ he 
would no longer verbalize at all, though he would open his eyes, 
he also rarely moved his extremities. The CT scan revealed 
possible subacute embolic infarcts. Neurology work-up including 
multiple imaging of cerebral vasculature revealed a large 
filling defect of R ICA extending to skull base He was started 
on ASA 325mg per neuro recs. Vascular surgery consulted re R ICA 
occlusion and advised that there no indication for CEA at this 
time. On ___ and ___ the patient appeared much more alert than 
previous exams. He would open his eyes spontaneously and was 
oriented to person and place (with some receptive language 
delay.

Cardiovascular:  
The patient was hypertensive throughout his hospital stay. He 
had a goal SBP<160 which was attained with a labetalol drip 
which was transitioned to PO labetalol once he was tolerating 
PO.

Pulmonary:  
He was intubated upon admission to ensure airway protection. He 
was weaned to CPAP and then successfully extubated before his 
transfer to the floor.

GI/FEN:  
He was made NPO upon arrival because of his inability to 
coordinate swallowing around the ET tube. Electrolytes were 
repleted as necessary, IV fluids were stopped once he was 
tolerating gtube feeds. a PEG was placed ___ and he started PEG 
tube feeds on ___. Which he tolerated.

MSK:  
He presented with right ___ rib fractures, he worked with ___ and 
OT to transition his care.

Endocrine:  
In the ICU he was maintained on an insulin sliding scale with a 
goal blood glucose between 150 and 100.

Mr. ___ was transferred to the inpatient ward on ___.  He 
was continued on tube feedings via his PEG tube, which he 
continued to tolerate well.  A speech and swallow evaluation was 
conducted on the day of discharge, ___.  Due to inability to 
follow commands, a true swallow evaluation could not be 
completed.  He had little to no swallow reflex to the one or two 
ice chips he did consume.  Mr. ___ was therefore kept NPO and 
his swallowing will have to be reassessed in the future while at 
rehab.  The patient continued on his anti-hypertensive regimen, 
where he continued to be hemodynamically stable with a SBP of < 
160mm Hg.  

At the time of discharge, Mr. ___ was afebrile,

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed male with a history of
focal epilepsy (probable temporal) who recently established care
with Dr. ___ in ___ who presents with increased seizure
frequency. 

History obtained from patient and medical record. He first saw
Dr. ___ in ___ with complaints of amnesia. At that time
he reported discrete ___ minute episodes of confusion (not
remember what day it was, repeating himself) which would resolve
and he would go back to feeling completely normal. He never had

Please see Dr. ___ note from ___ regarding
the details.   

Dr. ___ his history was consistent with epilepsy (focal,
probably temporal) and he was started on Keppra 500 mg BID at
that time (___). He also had a 48 hour ambulatory EGG which
showed ""bitemporal independent and  occasional bitemporal
synchronous slowing along with relatively infrequent 
bursts of more generalized but centrally predominant theta
activity. These  findings are relatively nonspecific and may
represent underlying multifocal  subcortical pathological
abnormalities, vascular disease or sequela of 
traumatic head injury. No seizure activity was acquired during
the recording sessions. No interictal epileptic activity was
noted.""

Since he saw Dr. ___ in ___, he reports full compliance with
his Keppra. He has not been sick recently and has had no 
interval
head trauma. He has trouble remembering the details of what
brought him to the hospital today but thinks it was because of

cannot be reached as he cannot remember their numbers (but he
says he would not usually remember them). Mr. ___ thinks he
did not have any seizures up until his recent episode which
brought him to the hospital. He reports that he cannot remember
what happened but he thinks he had a seizure at church
(___). He does not remember the interval history but
reports that he feels back to his normal self. 

Review of limited ___ records indicate that his family
brought him to the hospital on ___ with concern for increased
seizure frequency. He reportedly was having staring episodes and
repeating himself for ___ days leading up to presentations. The
episodes were more frequently and lasting longer so they finally
took him to the hospital. At ___, he was having episodes of
staring into space and repeating himself. This was of unclear
duration. He was given Ativan 2 mg IV x1 and Keppra 1 g x1. WBC

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Epilepsy service on ___ in the 
setting of increased seizure frequency. He was placed on 
continuous video EEG. He was initially kept on his home Keppra 
but this was then held from ___ in an effort to capture 
seizures. Mr. ___ did not have any clinical or 
electrographic seizures and there were no epileptiform spikes on 
his EEG. In coordination with the family, his medication was 
restarted 24 hours prior to discharge. Therefore his diagnosis 
remains epilepsy that is likely temporal lobe epilepsy based on 
semiology and family history however the EEG is non-diagnostic. 
As part of his evaluation for new onset epilepsy, an LP was 
performed on ___ which had 0 WBC, 1 RBC. An autoimmune 
encephalitis panel was sent out and is pending at the time of 
discharge. HSV PCR was negative. Otherwise, Mr. ___ remained 
on his home diabetes regimen with stable blood sugar 
measurements and continues his levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

IMAGING:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___  FINDINGS:  The position 
of the right-sided PICC line is unchanged.  Heart appears 
enlarged.  Trachea is midline.  There is some widening of 
mediastinum, mainly on the right side of the carina suggestive 
of a loculated pleural effusion.  This does not appear to be 
significantly changed from the prior study.  A small left 
pleural effusion is stable.  There is some improvement of the 
right-sided atelectatic changes.  No pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Marginal improvement of the right lung atelectatic 
changes 
compared to the previous study, otherwise unchanged.
 
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of ___  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis. 
2.  Hepatosplenomegaly. 
3.  Minimal ascites and small right pleural effusion. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___  
There is interval progression of right lower lobe pleural 
effusion and right lung consolidation highly concerning for 
interval development of infectious process.  There is also 
additional involvement of left mid lung opacity, concerning for 
infectious process as well.  Small bilateral pleural effusions 
cannot be excluded.  Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid 
SVC.  The 
heart size and mediastinum are stable. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New peribronchiolar nodular opacities are visualized in the 
posterior 
segment of the right upper lobe as well as in the non-collapsed 
portions of the superior segment of the right lower lobe and are 
suggestive of an 
infectious process. 
2.  Mild interval decrease in dominant loculated right lower 
hemithorax 
pleural effusion/empyema as well as the second large 
paramediastinal right pleural effusion. 
3.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is stable. 

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of ___  4:12:26 ___ 
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Lateral 
ST-T wave 
flattening. No major change from the previous tracing. 
 
CXR ___: IMPRESSION: 1.  Right subclavian PICC line remains 
unchanged in position.  There has been interval worsening of 
consolidation which now involves the right upper lobe and left 
upper and mid lung.  There has also been progression at the left 
lung base.  The right mid and lower lung continues to be stably 
consolidated.  These findings are concerning for worsening 
pneumonia with the differential also including hemorrhage or 
leukemic infiltrates given the patient's history of leukemia.  
Clinical correlation is advised.  The heart remains stably 
enlarged.  There is fullness to the mediastinal contours, some 
of which correlates with a loculated right pleural effusion seen 
on the CT study dated ___.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence 
of pulmonary edema. 

EKG ___: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 
Poor R wave progression, probable normal variant. Low amplitude 
QRS complexes in the limb leads. Non-specific lateral ST-T wave 
changes. Compared to the previous tracing  of ___ QRS 
voltage in the limb leads has decreased further. One aberrantly 
conducted beat versus a ventricular premature beat is seen.

admitted for neutropenic fever and pneumonia, and transferred to 
___ for respiratory distress requiring BiPAP treatment; pt 
stabilized, transferred back to the floor.

Active issues:
#Refractory biphenotypic leukemia: Pt is s/p hyperCVAD, ___, decitabine, MEC ___, several more cycles decitabine last 
___, followed by Dr. ___, now on hydroxurea. Patient is 
neutropenic, thrombocytopenic and anemic.  He will not be 
receiving further chemotherapy.  Patient received supportive 
care with transfusions of red cells and platelets as needed.   

#Neutropenic fever: Patient presented with rhinorrhea developing 
into sorethroat, cough and fever.  A chest x-ray was unchanged 
from previous admission.  The patient was placed on oxygen and 
blood cultures were drawn.  He was continued on voriconazole for 
history of disseminated fusarium and linezolid for history of 
VRE empyema.  Ertapenam was changed to Cefepime given history of 
E. coli bacteremia in order to broaden for possible Pseudomonas. 
 The infectious disease team was consulted, who recommended 
switching cefepime to meropenem.  A respiratory culture was done 
and the patient was found to be positive for parainfluenza.  The 
patient's respiratory status declined over the course of the 
next week. A CT was done on ___ which showed new 
peribronchiolar opacity in right upper and right lower lobe 
compatible with infection.  On ___ antibiotics were changed to 
voriconazole, cefepime, metronidazole, linezolid and levaquin.  
The patient was supported with albuterol nebulizers and 
ipratropium for obstructive lung disease along with cough 
suppressants.  Respiratory status declined acutely on ___ 
the patient desaturated to 84% and was placed on a 
non-rebreather briefly and then transitioned to a mask on 6 
liters.  An arterial blood gas revealed a PO2 of 43 and PCO2 of 
48.  The patient and family wished to persue BiPap and the 
patient was transferred to the ICU for continued care. While in 
the ICU, pt was briefly on BiPaP overnight but was soon able to 
be on shovel mask. He was gently diuresed and his respiratory 
status remained stable on shovel mask O2. Pt was transferred out 
of the ICU and onto the ___ floor. While on the floor he 
received a prednisone taper (40mg x2days, 30x2days, 20x2days, 
10x2days). He also received 10g IVIG.  Pt was switched to 
xopenex from albuterol nebs due to tachycardia. Pt's respiratory 
status slowly improved and he remained stable on ___ NC. His IV 
antibiotics were taken off and he remained afebrile for several 
days prior to discharge.  

Chronic issues:  
# Atrial fibrillation: History of paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation. Rate control has previously been difficult with 
hypotension on beta blockade. Patient was continued on 
metoprolol 50 mg BID, digoxin 12mcg daily and diltiazem in 
fractionated doses.  His rates were in the low 100's to 110's 
and systolic blood pressures were mostly in the 90's, consistent 
with prior admissions.  In the ICU, his rates were increased to 
the 130's, and his metoprolol was increased to 50 mg PO TID.  He 
tolerated this well. He was continued on this regimen upon 
transfer to the floor.

# Hepatitis B: Patient has known hepatitis B and was continued 
on Lamivudine 100mg po daily.

# Anxiety: The patient was continued on home lorazepam 0.5mg 
tabs q4hrs as needed.  
  
Transitional issues:
# Goals of care: Per most recent clinic note, Pt has a 
___ Care form at home. He is DNR/DNI but does 
want antibiotics, blood products, and admission if he becomes 
ill.  Pt does not want additional ICU admissions or Bipap.
# Pt will need close follow up and continued platelet and blood 
transfusions

She was previously treated with Lovenox and was admitted to the hospital with an arterial bleed into her thigh, which required embolization of the left medial femoral circumflex artery. The patient's bleeding resolved with the application of Surgicel and direct pressure, but she experienced recurrent bleeding when she got up to use the bathroom. A CT scan revealed a fluid collection with surrounding stranding, consistent with an abscess. The patient was treated with antibiotics and was advised to remain non-weightbearing. She was also prescribed medications including acetaminophen, furosemide, levothyroxine, and valacyclovir.

The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, hypothyroidism, COPD, and prior DVT. She also has a history of breast cancer, asthma, and ocular herpes. Her social history is significant for a motor vehicle accident in which she believes part of her skull was removed.

The patient's physical examination revealed a firm hematoma in her left upper thigh, as well as a chronic appearing wound with no active bleeding.

Brief Hospital Course:
Key Information for Outside Providers: 
___ is a ___ year old female with history of ESRD on HD, 
peripheral vascular disease status post RLE BKA, admitted 
___ with sepsis secondary to MRSA bacteremia, now status 
post removal and replacement of her tunneled HD line able to be 
discharged home with planned course of vancomycin to be 
continued at HD

# MRSA Sepsis secondary to
# Acute blood stream infection 
# Suspected Acute bacterial Endocarditis 
# L lateral heel ulcer 
Patient with history of MRSA line infection ___ who 
presented with MRSA bacteremia presumed ___ line infection. 
Patient's TTE was concerning for possible vegetation on 
tricuspid valve.  She was seen by ID consult service who 
initially recommended TEE, but patient declined this and was 
able to verbalize her understanding.  Source of bacteremia felt 
to be line-related, although ID also recommended MRI of L heel, 
where she had an unhealed ulcer that was debrided by podiatry.  
Given need for IV contrast, patient declined study due to 
chronic risks associated with MRI contrast in patients who are 
ESRD.  Patient had HD catheter removed on ___, then had a 
line replaced on ___.  Patient treated with IV vancomcyin 
with clinical improvement.  Last positive blood cultures were 
drawn on ___. Because endocarditis and/or osteomyelitis 
could not be definitively ruled out, ID consult service 
recommended completion of 6-week course of Vancomycin, dosed at 
HD.  

# Difficult access 
___ initially tried to place a new line on the left side, to 
preserve the right-sided vasculature for a future AV graft. 
Unfortunately, a L IJ and L subclavian line was unable to be 
placed due to sclerosis and or thrombosis of the L IJ and L 
subclavian, likely secondary to multiple access attempts. The 
patient refused femoral access and was able to verbalize 
understanding of clinical situation.  Per discussion with Renal 
and ___, the decision was made to place R IJ line as above. 

# Behavioral Issues 
Patient often refused medications during this admission. In 
speaking to the patient, she believes that many medications 
make her sick. In speaking to her HCP, her brother ___ 
___, he reports that she often refuses medications at home as 
well.  Inpatient psychiatry consult team saw patient for 
assessment regarding capacity to make medical decisions 
relating to medications and inpatient managemetn.  She was felt 
to not pose a danger to herself, and in discussions with team 
was able to demonstrate understanding of her decisions and 
their impact on her health.  She was recommended for outpatient 
follow up with psychiatry and counseling. Of note, per review 
of prior records, does have history of concussion as child. 
Evaluated by Cognitive Neurology in ___. Found to have 
significantly low IQ and learning deficits, although masked by 
verbal fluency. Her ability to handle new and complex info is 
impaired.  During this admission extra time was spent 
counseling patient to ensure she understood clinical situation, 
team recommendations and risk/benefit as it related to her 
clinical state.

# Gastroparesis
Initial presentation notable for nausea and vomiting. No 
evidence of acute abnormality on CT A/P and abdominal exam 
reassuring.  Felt to represent gastroparesis flare.  Treated 
with supportive care with resolution of symptoms.  She was able 
to tolerate a regular diet. 

# ESRD: On HD TThSa. Pt declined sevelamer/nephrocaps as she 
reported they worsen her chronic symptoms of nausea. 

# Hyperphosphatemia: Pt declined phosphate binders this 
admission. 

# Mild Intermittent Asthma
Continued home flovent. 

# DM type 2
Held glipizide while inpatient, restarted upon discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, he underwent a deceased donor liver transplant from 
a ___ yo DBD. Piggyback, PV-PV, CHA-CHA, BD-BD with internal 
biliary stent (No extra vessels, 740 cellsaver, 5 PRBC).  
Surgeon was Dr. ___. Please refer to the operative 
note for details.  Postop, he transferred to the SICU intubated, 
and was taken back to the OR on POD 1 for concern for IVC 
obstruction. There was no evidence of obstruction, the diaphragm 
was plicated to prevent the liver from falling over the IVC and 
obstructing flow. He was transferred to the SICU and then 
eventually the floor for post-operative care. 
.
He was kept intubated and sedated immediately post-operatively. 
Sedation was complicated by intermittent agitation that required 
treatment with antipsychotic medication. He was extubated on 
___, and then was intermittently confused, requiring 
scheduled seroquel for management of his agitation at the time 
of transfer to the regular hospital floor. The Seroquel was 
weaned to off, and mental status was markedly improved. Patient 
did very well with medication teaching.
.
He developed afib with RVR while in the SICU - this did not 
respond to to metoprolol IV push or amiodarone loading. The 
patient was given a loading dose of digoxin and transitioned to 
propanolol with satisfactory rate control but remained in atrial 
fibrillation at the time of transfer to the floor. He remained 
hemodynamically stable with the exception of a brief pressor 
requirement immediately post op. 
Surface echo was performed on ___ per cardiology 
recommendation for Afib follow up. This echo showed a new 
moderate loculated pericardial effusion. Repeat echo two days 
later showed large/increased pericardial effusion with s/o 
tamponade. On ___, thoracic performed a pericardial window 
with drain placement with 200cc drained. A drain was left in the 
pericardial space. Fluid was sent for culture and was negative. 
Right atrial collapse was no longer present. Biventricular 
function remained preserved. Postop CXR was stable without 
pneumothorax. Postop ekg demonstrated aflutter with rate in ___. 
Cardiology recommended continuation of digoxin and propranolol 
with repeat TTE on ___ that demonstrated trace pericardial 
effusion. The drain was removed on ___. The propranolol was 
discontinued on ___. Digoxin was continued for rate control..
Pulmonary: He had a brief acute ventilator dependent respiratory 
failure immediately post-operatively. He was given furosemide 
for presumed volume overload, and he successfully extubated on 
___. He was weaned to room air with intermittent nasal cannula 
requirement at the time of transfer to the floor.
.
GI: Initially, he was kept NPO with a NG tube. Trickle tube 
feeds were started. During an episode of agitation, pt 
self-discontinued the NGT. Clear liquids were started then 
advanced to regular diet, which he tolerated. LFTs continued to 
decrease. On ___, the sub-hepatic drain became bilious despite 
stable LFTs. An ERCP was done noting bile anastomosis site 
extravasation and a ___ stent was placed. He tolerated this 
procedure well and was given Cipro that was to continue until 
___. JP drains were removed when non-bilious and output was 
decreased ___ and ___. 

GU/FEN:Foley catheter placed in  OR was removed. Urine output 
was appropriate throughout SICU course. Intermittent doses of 
furosemide were needed. Weight was done to 99.7kg on ___, down 
from preop 102.5kg.  

.
ID: He had low grade temps to 100-101. At the time of transfer 
to the floor, these had resolved. All cultures have been 
negative. On ___, WBC increased to 18. Abdominal CT showed a 
larger, poorly defined collection.  On ___, he underwent 
CT-guided placement of an ___ pigtail catheter into the mid  
abdominal fluid collection.  120 cc of bilious fluid was 
aspirated and samples were sent for microbiology. These cultures 
were negative. Fluid had a t.bili of 1.4. Incision appeared 
intact (staples removed ___ redness or drainage. 
.
HEME: CBC was closely watched for signs of bleeding, of which 
there was none.
.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

He was given induction immunosuppression that consisted of 
Cellcept 1 gram and solumedrol. Solu-medrol was tapered to 
prednisone and will further taper per pathway. Cellcept 1 gram 
twice daily was started postop. However, he developed diarrhea 
(C.diff negative)and was this was changed 500 qid without much 
change. Cellcept was later changed to myfortic with decreased 
stooling. Tacrolimus was started on postop day 1. Doses were 
adjusted per daily trough level. Most recent doses were as 
follows:

 
___ FK 1.5/1.5 (8.7)
___ FK 1.5/1.5 (9.0)  
___ FK 1.5/1.5 (10.1) 
___ switched to myfortic 360 QID
___ FK ___  
___ FK 1.5/1.5(13)
___ FK ___ (9.5)

He was initially evaluated by ___ and rehab was recommended. 
However, he progressed and was declared safe for home upon ___ 
reassessment. ___ services were arranged to follow him as he 
went home with the drain in the mid abdominal collection.

Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.

___ TTE
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed 
(LVEF= ___ %) with akinesis of the basal to mid inferior and 
inferolateral walls and global hypokinesis of the remaining 
segments. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular

function are normal. The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no 
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is 
likely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic 
regurgitation. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___,

ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricle is not well 
seen. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild 
to moderate (___) central aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) central mitral regurgitation is

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted due to worsening fatigue. After some testing, 
it was determined that this was due to worsening of your atrial 
fibrillation. For that reason, we treated you with a 
cardioversion to get you back into a normal sinus rhythm. We 
also started a medication called amiodarone to help keep you in 
a normal rhythm. It will be important to follow up with your 
cardiologist for management of this medication. We also 
decreased your metoprolol to 50mg, stopped your digoxin, and 
decreased your simvastatin to 20mg. We decreased your lasix to 
40mg per day. Please stop taking your glipizide and lisinopril 
until you see your primary care doctor to ensure you kidney 
function is ok. It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Best of luck,
Your ___ medical team

He has a history of coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has also had recurrent deep vein thrombosis and has been on warfarin. His past medical history is significant for a previous myocardial infarction, stent placement, and cardiac catheterization. He has been experiencing worsening fatigue and was admitted to the hospital for diuresis.

The patient's physical exam revealed mild jugular venous distension, bilateral lower extremity edema, and bibasilar crackles. His laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and creatinine levels. His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed atrial fibrillation and normal axis.

The patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. He was started on digoxin and furosemide during his hospital stay.

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and his physical exam revealed no acute distress. He was prescribed medications including aspirin, digoxin, and furosemide. His laboratory results showed improvement in his troponin and BNP levels, and his creatinine level was stable. ||endoftext||"

Social History:

Family History:
Father was an alcoholic.  
 
Physical Exam:
___ well known to ___ for multiple alcohol related admissions, 
BIBA for ___ unresponsive on a park bench. 

 

The patient states that today he got back together with his 
long-term girlfriend/wife who brought him a family sized bottle 
of Listerine in the mall and then layed on bench and became 
unresponsive.  He states that they began to fight and then she 
beat him about the head and chest with his own cane.  She left 
and at a time distant to the assault he passed out on a park 
bench.  He states that he drank more of the listerine, ""being 
the bigger man.""  

 

EMS arrived and finger stick was found to be in the 150's. In 
the ER he opened his eyes and was able to communicate 
appropriately despite slurred speech. He adamantly claimed that 
he only drank listerine, and no other drugs.  Initial vitals 
were 99.1 100 144/78 20 100%. 

.

Plan was for CIWA and observation until sober re-evaluation.  
However after several hours in observation he began to withdraw 
and score on CIWA for tremulousness and tachycardia.  Given his 
seizure history and requirement of 6mg Ativan over an hour he 
was transferred to the ___.

.

 

On arrival here, he is alert, interactive and asking for pain 
meds

.

Of note Mr ___ has had multiple recent admissions as 
follows:

- ___ ICU w/ d/c AMA on ___ for presumed isopropyl alcohol 
intoxication and admission from ___ to ___ for presumed 
aspiration pneumonia on cefpodoxime/azithromycin 

- ___ ___ for fevers, CP, and productive cough cough.  

.  

- ___ ICU from ___ to ___. Patient was visiting his wife 
___ in the ICU when he was noted to become unresponsive.

- Durring his hospitalization ___ he called his ___ PCP and 
complained of not getting enough pain meds, he then told his PCP 
___ ""if he didnt give him more pain meds he would put him in as 
much pain as he (___) was already in.""  This resulted in the 
patient being banned from ___ clinic, patient relations 
involvement and an agreement by which Mr. ___ is not 
allowed to get any outpatient prescriptions from ___.

___ 06:15AM BLOOD Osmolal-___ with complicated social situation and multiple ___ 
admission for ingestions of alcohol and its related denatured 
counterparts.

.

Listerine Ingestion: 

Per the ingredient list Listerine is 40% etoh and also includes 
a salicylate.  Mr ___ ETOH level on admission to the ICU 
was 85 while his salicylate level was negative.  It is likely 
that ETOH was driving all of his assorted issues.  This likely 
explained his lowish anion gap metabolic acidosis on admission.  
Using the formula that ETOH is corrected for in the osmolar gap 
by dividing by 3.8, his osmolar gap is accounted for by his ETOH 
level, making coingestion with isopropanol or ethylene glycol 
much less likely.  He scored only once on CIWA, over 18 hours 
ago, and currently has normal vital signs.  We will plan for 
discharge. 

- Per prior agreement he will not be discharged with 
prescriptions for any medications
.
Hypoxia:
Suspect medication induced hypoventilion c/b splinting leading 
to increased CO2 and thus increased CO2 admixture via the 
alveolar gas equation, stably in the low 90's overnight while 
asleep. Resolved morning of discharge.
.
Pain control:
This patient is a terrible candidate for opiates, and refuses 
nsaids, we used low dose tylenol and would not give opiates in 
any situation if possible.  Despite sleeping easily, he 
continued to request fioricet/fioranol for his migraines when he 
awakened, but this medication was not in his medication discarge 
list.  He was given tylenol.
.
Rib Pain:
No hct drop to raise c/f splenic rupture, no fractured ribs, no 
ptx
.
Multiple Psychiatric diagnoses:
Patient was continued on his home regimen, he should continue 
with his home supply at home.
.
?Seizure d/o history:
.
Doctor ___ recent note calls into question his seizure 
history; however, the patient comes in with a positive 
barbiturate level.   Given his lack of seizure disorders and 
previous plans, we will discharge him without a prescription for 
phenobarb.

.

Dicharge planning:

Please refer to the below note from Chief Resident ___ 
regarding his rules for discharge.
.  
"" After discussion with the patient and his consulting services, 
we will not provide prescriptions for any of his reported home 
medication including clonazepam, carbamazepine, amitriptyline, 
olanzapine or mirtazapine. At this time, the risk of significant 
toxicity including death, in the setting of his ongoing 
substance abuse is greater the risk of any potential withdrawal 
symptoms.
.
After discussion with neurology we will provide the patient with 
a short duration of phenobarbital with planned Neurology Access 
Clinic follow up.""

attributable to Sweet's, although interestingly flares of the 
two seem to co-occur. Complained of worsening joint pain ___ 
with rising CRP, for which rheumatology was consulted. U/S 
performed at rheum's requests showed evidence of 
synovitis/tenosynovitis of the R MCP/PIP joints without 
effusions. Rheum recommended
increasing prednisone to 30mg x 3d followed by taper to 20mg 
daily and outpatient f/u for consideration of DMARD. She will

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ F with history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis 
c/b diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension and 
encephalopathy currently on transplant list, IDDM, HTN and HLD 
who was directly admitted from home for acute renal failure.
  
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr < 1.5. Admitted with 
creatinine of 2.0, FeNa on admission 0.28% indicating pre-renal 
state. No evidence of infection on admission without fevers, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, suprapubic tenderness or dysuria, UA 
with epis and does not indicate UTI. Patient received albumin 
1g/kg (62.5grams) on HD 1 and morning after creatinine improved 
to 1.7. On HD 2 H/H was low so instead of albumin patient was 
volume challenged with 1 unit PRBCs and 25grams of albumin (1 
unit PRBCs=25 grams albumin). Diagnostic paracentesis ruled out 
SBP. Creatinine worsened after initial volume challenge and did 
not respond to second round of 1g/kg albumin. After failed 
improvement diagnosis of hepatorenal synrome was made and 
midodrine/octreotide were started and uptitrated without 
improvement in creatinine.  Cr steadily continued to rise, 
patient became oliguric and was volume overloaded.  The renal 
team was consulted.  Initially, plan was for pt to have HD line 
placed in ___ and start dialysis.  However, given active bleeding 
(see below), she was trasferred to SICU and started on CVVH.
       
# Cirrhosis: Chronic, related to schistosomiasis complicated by 
diuretic refractory ascites, chronic renal failure, portal 
hypertension, thrombocytopenia, prior SBP and encephalopathy. 
MELD 20 on admission with Childs Class C. Without evidence of 
encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation or asterixis on 
admission. Continued Rifaximin 550mg PO BID and Lactulose TID 
for HE prophylaxis. Continued Ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. 
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed and ruled out SBP. No GI 
endoscopy in our system but patient being evaluated for 
transplant, cannot be on transplant list without endoscopy so 
presumably completed somewhere. MELD rose to >30 in setting of 
hepatorenal syndrome and patient was listed for ABO incompatible 
liver. As HRS progressed, MELD score was at 40 on transfer to 
the SICU.

# Pulmonary edema: Pt w/ pulm edema on CXR on ___ and mildly 
symptomatic. Initially, pt subjectively some SOB, but O2 low to 
mid ___ on RA.  After 2 days, developed O2 requirement.  
Overload most likely in the setting of rapidly deteriorating 
renal function.  Less likely cirrhosis induced cardiomyopathy.  
Last TTE ___ with normal EF.  Repeat TTE with still normal EF 
but new moderate PA systolic HTN. Attempted to diurese with 
Lasix 20 iv then 80, put out very small amt of urine, 
incontinent.   In setting of rapidly progressive HRS, pt became 
oliguric and was unable to mobilize fluid.  Plan was made for 
dialysis as above.

# Hard palate bleed:  On ___ at ~6am, pt developed bleed right 
hard palate.  This was likely ___ mild oral trauma in the 
setting of coagulopathy--INR 3.6, platelets 75.  Initially, 
attempted to stop by applying pressure, unsuccessful.  Per 
discussion with ENT and OMFS, attempted to stop the bleed with 
afrin soaked gauze, topical thrombin, silver nitrate, 
aminocaproic acid.  Also transfused with platelets, FFP, and 
RBCs (as hct was 22 down from 25 at last check). Held continuous 
pressure for ~3 hours.  As soon as pressure was released, active 
bleeding was visualized.  Tamponaded bleed for ~10 minutes, but 
again continued to have uncontrollable bleed and was transferred 
to SICU on the transplant surgery service for elective 
intubation and packing.  The lesion was cauterized and the 
bleeding was controlled.  She was initially successfully 
extubated at transferred to the floor. 

# Hyponatremia: Hypervolumic hyponatremia from cirrhosis. Did 
not diurese patient given ___. Albumin and PRBCs given for 
intravascular volume and patient kept on 1.5L fluid restricted 
diet. She remained hyponatremic so fluid restricted further to 
1.2L with improvement in Na.
    
# Acute anemia: Patient with chronic anemia related to cirrhosis 
though with acute drop on HD 2. Unclear etiology without GIB 
during admission. Unknown if patient has varices without 
endoscopy in our system and is not on beta-blocker so presumably 
none on prior endoscopy. Possible hct drop was in setting of 
volume challenge overnight and dilutional effect though WBC and 
platelets unchanged. She was transfused 1 unit PRBCs both for 
anemia and volume challenge. Hct remained stable following 
transfusion.
     
# DM: Insulin Dependent, Type II. Hyperglycemic during admissin. 
Continued Glargine 12 units qHS and HISS
    
# HLD: Chronic, stable, continue zetia 
   
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Continue holding diuretics
- Recommend tracking down endoscopy report, unknown where 
completed

ICU Course ___ to ___, date of death)
Ms ___ was transferred to the surgical ICU the morning of 
___ after developing worsening melena. She had an EGD the day 
prior for the purpose of Dobhoff feeding tube placement, and 
during that EGD a duodenal polyp was noted and biopsied. Of 
note, she had an INR of 2.5 and fibrinogen of 59 prior to the 
procedure so snare removal of the polyp was deferred. The 
evening following the EGD, she had several episodes of melena 
thus prompting transfer to the ICU to facilitate repeat emergent 
EGD. The EGD ___ showed a lot of old blood around the polyp, but 
no active bleed from the stalk. 
The first few days in the SICU she remained HD stable, but 
continued to have melena with an unstable hematocrit. We 
transfused RBC, FFP, platelets and cryo to goal Hct of 30 and 
correct her coagulopathy. We were unable to completely correct 
her, and she began having significant oral bleeding. By ___, 
she was coughing blood, had an increased oxygen requirement. She 
remained encephalopathic and was not protecting her airway 
sufficiently so she was intubated. After intubation she had a 
pressor requirement which remained until time of death. She was 
started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/mica) and a CT 
torso showed severe pneumonia with very little residual aerated 
lung volume. 
On ___ she was begun on CVVH for acidosis and had increased 
pressor requirement with the addition of vasopressin. We 
continued to transfuse RBC/FFP/cryo to maintain blood levels.
On ___ she had increased pressor requirement and markedly 
increased oral bleeding. It was estimated she bleed 600cc 
periorally this day. Transfusions continued and she remained on 
high dose levo/vaso, though her pressor requirement was slightly 
less than the day prior. A family meeting was held. It was 
decided she would not want to be on full life support for more 
than 5 days. As it had been 3 days to this point, we decided to 
make a final decision ___ unless she acutely worsened.
On ___, the day of her death, she acutely worsened during the 
day. She became hypotensive despite increasing her pressor 
doses. Melena and oral bleeding increased and she grew 
increasingly tachycardic. She was not responding hemodynamically 
to significant product transfusion, and her ventilator settings 
were increased with more oxygen needed. Another family meeting 
was held and we discussed that she was decompensating rapidly 
and likely had an unsurvivable condition. The family present was 
receptive and understanding. She was transitioned to comfort 
care at 7pm, though the endotracheal tube was left in to prevent 
aspirating blood which we felt would cause her too much 
discomfort. She was started on a morphine drip. Her heart rate 
and blood pressure gradually declined and asystole occured at 
9:28pm. She was declared at 9:30pm. The family declined an 
autopsy.

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 69-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure. She has a history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and encephalopathy, and is currently on the transplant list. She was recently discharged from another hospital where she was admitted for abdominal distension, and was directly admitted to this hospital for acute renal failure. The patient's past medical history includes schistosomiasis complicated by cirrhosis and ascites, hypertension, IDDM, dyslipidemia, and nephrolithiasis.

The patient's allergies include aspirin. She has a history of bleeding, including a recent episode of hematochezia and melena, and has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome. She has also been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and has required oxygen therapy.

The patient's medications at discharge include midodrine and octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome, and rifaximin and lactulose for prophylaxis against hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient underwent several procedures during her hospital stay, including a diagnostic paracentesis, which ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and an EGD with feeding tube placement and duodenal polyp biopsy. She also underwent a TTE, which showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, including ALT, AST, and LDH, as well as elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Her creatinine level was elevated at 2.0 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was elevated at 28 mg/dL. Her albumin level was low at 3.7 g/dL, and her calcium level was elevated at 9.8 mg/dL.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was complicated by her underlying liver disease and acute renal failure, and she required multiple interventions to manage her symptoms and stabilize her condition. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
___ man with DM type 1 and end-stage renal disease presents for 
initiation of hemodialysis given worsening nausea, vomiting, 
pruritis x 10 days.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#. End-stage renal disease: 
Recent symptoms were most likely due to increasing uremia in the 
setting of end-stage diabetic nephropathy. Infection was thought 
unlikely given this patient's lack of fevers, symptoms of upper 
respiratory infection (cough, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain) or 
GI infection (diarrhea, hematochezia). On admission, patient's 
labs were notable for BUN 97, Cr 14.8, and phosphate 6.4; on 
discharge these improved to BUN 44, Cr 9.4, and phosphate 5.2; 
the patient noted a marked improvement in his symptoms and 
overall well-being.
.
Hepatitis serologies were negative for Hepatitis C (antibody) 
and Hepatitis B (hep B core Ab, surface Ab, surface Ag, Hep C 
Ab), indicating lack of Hep C infection and either 
non-vaccination for Hep B or loss of immunity. Patient was 
advised to check his vaccination status with his PCP with 
regards to his Hep B
.
PPD was placed on ___ and read as negative 48 hours later, 
on ___.
.
#. Hypertension: stable on home regimen of carvedilol and 
furosemide, with a baseline SBP of ~145 (per patient), up to 
200's at ___ immediately prior to dialysis sessions, gradually 
decreasing to baseline after conclusion of each session. This 
was most likely partially due to anxiety before dialysis (per 
pt. report), and is expected to improve as patient gets used to 
the procedure. 500cc of ultrafiltrate was withdrawn during the 
first 2 sessions. Patient's home regimen of furosemide 40mg was 
continued; his carvedilol dose was increased to 6.25mg BID, and 
Losartan, which had been previously stopped due to declining 
renal function, was re-started at 50mg qD per the recommendation 
of the Renal service.
.  
INACTIVE ISSUES
#. Anemia: likely due to chronic kidney disease; Fe deficiency 
and low ferritin stores noted during workup in ___. Now 
treated with Epoetin alfa; last dose received ""several days 
before"" admission (per patient). Blood clots in vomitus were 
felt most likely representative of ___ tears. Hct 
stable at ___: 26.2 on admission, 26.4 on discharge.
.
#. Diabetes: long-standing, type 1; HbA1c 8.0 ___ stable 
on home insulin regimen (lantus 31U qHS) with sliding scale 
based on carbohydrate counting by the patient.
.
#. Bone/mineral: labs on ___ show Ca 8.4, Mg 2, and 
Phosphate improving to 5.2 on discharge. Renal team stated that 
the patient's Phosphate levels should normalize with dialysis; 
meanwhile, Sevelamer was continued TID with meals.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
Discharge: Patient was advised to follow-up with his PCP, ___ 
___, MD; an appointment was scheduled for ___ at 1:40 ___.  In addition, he was placed in an outpatient 
___ facility, started thrice-weekly sessions on 
___ at 11:30 am. at the ___ ___, ___. It was 
felt, in discussions with the in-patient Renal Dialysis 
attending that the patient would be okay hemodynamically and 
electrolyte-wise to wait until that ___ for repeat 
hemodialysis after discharge post-hemodialysis on a ___ 
prior.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the ___ for initiation of hemodialysis 
for treatment of your nausea, vomiting, and other recent 
symptoms related to your chronic kidney disease. On admission, 
your vital signs were normal and stable, with the exception of 
very high blood pressure (213/109); your lab values on admission 
were notable for anemia and elevated blood urea nitrogen, 
creatinine, and phosphate, which are all signs of impaired 
kidney function.  Your hemodialysis sessions went well; we also 
re-started you on a blood pressure medication Losartan and 
increased your Carvedilol. Your blood pressure slowly normalized 
to your normal value (systolic blood pressure 145).
.
You had a PPD placed, which is a test to screen for 
tuberculosis. This is done for all patients who start 
hemodialysis at facilities where there are many other end-stage 
renal disease patients. This was negative for tuberculosis. You 
also had your hepatitis serologies checked and your Hepatitis B 
tests were all negative. This means you either have never been 
immunized or your immunity has worn off. Please discuss with Dr. 
___ the ___ B vaccine series or getting a Hep B 
booster. 

Please continue to take your medications according to the 
instruction given to you by your prescribing physicians.

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 
The patient is an ___ year old female with a history of actively 
treated C. diff colitis, pneumobilia, CAD, hypertension, and 
hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED from her nursing home 
with diarrhea, worsening mental status, and low blood pressure.  
Per nursing home records, she had been having loose stools for 
the last 4 days.  She was being actively treated for C. diff 
colitis with Flagyl 500 mg PO TID, receiving her last dose on 
___ evening. She then began having low BPs, cold lower 
extremities, weakness, and poor appetite.
.
She initially developed C diff after a right hip fracture s/p 
right hip hemiarthroplasty on ___, which was complicated by 
a UTI and pneumonia.  She was on antibiotics for the pneumonia 
and subsequently developed C diff colitis.  She was admitted to 
___ from ___ to ___ for treatment of her C diff, and 
improved rapidly after IV fluids, Vancomycin PO, and Flagyl IV.  
She was discharged on a course of Flagyl PO.  Her current course 
of Flagyl was started on ___.  It is unclear if she has 
needed additional courses between her last admission and today.
.  
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 102.8, BP 135/77, HR 140, RR 
29, SpO2 92% on 2L NC.  Initial labs were notable for WBC 54.0 
(0% bands, 2% metas, 1% myelos), Hct 48.0, INR 1.8, creatinine 
1.2 (recent baseline 0.4-0.6), and Lactate 5.6.  Her UA showed 
WBC 6, many bacteria, small leuk esterase, and negative nitrite. 
 CXR was markedly suboptimal showing low lung volumes, bibasilar 
opacities likely atelectasis, moderately enlarged heart 
unchanged, and large hiatus hernia.  
.
CT abdomen showed a large stable hiatal hernia, pneumobilia, and 
diffuse colonic wall edema and stranding.  Surgery consult was 
called and did not feel that there were any acute surgical 
issues.  The pneumobilia was noted to be present on prior CTA 
chest from ___, though not commented upon in the radiology 
report.  Surgical consult felt that this may be postsurgical 
from prior cholecystectomy or sphinterotomy.
.
IV access was obtained with 18g x2 and 20g x1 peripherals IVs.  
She was treated with Vancomycin 1000 mg IV (not PO), Flagyl 500 
mg IV, and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV.  Because of her Lactate 5.6 
and tachycardia, she was given a total of 8L IV fluids in the 
ED, with her lactate decreasing to 2.0 afterwards.  Given the 
severity of her infection and continued tachycardia despite IV 
fluids, she was admitted to the ICU for further management.  
Vitals prior to transfer were T 103 rectally, HR 124, BP 114/58, 
RR 22, and SpO2 96% on 2L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she was fatigued but easily rousable and 
conversant.  She was oriented to person, ""hospital"", and ___. 
 She reported fever, abdominal discomfort, and generally feeling 
unwell, but was unable to describe her symptoms further.  She

Imaging:
CXR ___: Markedly suboptimal radiograph due to positioning. 
With this 
limitation in mind there are low lung volumes and bibasilar 
opacities at the lung bases, could be atelectasis. Moderately 
enlarged heart and large hiatus hernia are chronic. 

CT Abd + Pelvis ___: 
1. Large hiatal hernia. 
2. Pneumobilia. Surgical clips at the gallbladder fossa, status 
post 
cholecystectomy. 
3. Diffuse colonic wall edema and thickening with moderate 
extensive fat 
stranding in keeping with severe Clostridium difficile colitis. 
4. Stable T11 old compression fracture. 

CXR ___: Bilateral lower lobe collapse is stable on the right, 
worse on the left, now accompanied by increasing moderate left 
pleural effusion. Pulmonary edema is cleared. Large cardiac 
silhouette is unchanged. Left PIC line ends in the region of the 
azygos insertion in the SVC. No pneumothorax. Clinical service 
notified by telephone at the time of dictation.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman, with a history of actively treated C. diff 
colitis, pneumobilia, CAD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who 
was admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to C. diff 
colitis, c/b aspiration, tachycardia, parotitis, hypernatremia 
and a possible GI bleed.

# C diff Colitis: The patient presented with profuse diarrhea.  
Of note, she has a history of C. diff colitis diagnosed in 
___, for which she was actively being treated with 
Flagyl prior to admission.  Upon presentation to the ICU, she 
had a markedly high white count, and her C. diff toxin tests 
returned positive.  A CT scan on ___ revealed inflammation of 
the colon, but no perforation of the bowel.  She was treated 
aggressively, at first with Flagyl 500 mg IV q8h, vancomycin 500 
mg PO q6h and vancomycin 500 PR q6h (retention enema), to which 
tigecycline 100 mg IV, followed by 50 mg IV BID was added on 
___, per advice of the Infectious Disease team.  She was 
evaluated by surgery, but deemed to be a poor surgical candidate 
for colon resection.  Despite aggressive treatment, her WBC rose 
to a peak of 73.4, and remained elevated in the ___ thereafter.  
Her diarrhea continued, but lessened in volume.  Additionally, 
her abdomen became less tender over the course of her stay.
     She can continue her IV tigecycline and Flagyl at her 
nursing home, as she was prior to her hospital admission.

# Severe Sepsis: Upon admission, the patient showed evidence of 
organ dysfunction (kidneys andliver) with a source of infection 
(C. diff), meeting the criteria for severe sepsis.  She received 
IV fluid boluses to make up for her GI losses with diarrhea and 
to maintain good urine output.  Although initially hypotensive, 
she responded well to IVF and was subsequently normotensive for 
the rest of her admission.  Her liver enzymes showed improvement 
of perfusion, her INR responded to Vitamin K 5 mg x1, and her 
kidney function improved.  She was given IVF to maintain good 
urine output, and antibiotics for her source of infection.

# Aspiration: The patient had an acute episode of tachypnea on 
the afternoon of ___, which occurred after having some ice 
chips.  She subsequently had a Speech and Swallow evaluation, 
which determined that she would need to remain NPO, as she is at 
high risk for more aspiration.  If she and her family decide to 
pursue comfort feeding, it would be very appropriate for her.

# Sinus Tachycardia: Confirmed to be sinus tachycardia on 
EKG,likely multifactorial due to sepsis, volume depletion, 
withdrawal of beta blockers, anxiety and pain.  The patient was 
monitored on telemetry.  Her tachycardia was treated with fluid 
boluses and metoprolol.  It responded well to metoprolol 
succinate 50 mg PO BID.

# Parotitis: Patient developed tenderness and swelling in her 
right parotid on ___, which was treated with warm compresses.

#Hypernatremia: Most likely iatrogenic secondary to NS fluid 
boluses, with some element of her being unable to take in free 
water.  Sodium was corrected by giving free water IVF.

# GI bleed: The patient had melanotic stool on ___, with a 
stable hematocrit.  She was monitored for further signs of 
bleeding.  This likely occurred secondary to her colitis.

# Urinary Tract Infection: On admission, She had a mildly 
positive UA in the ED with WBC 6, many bacteria, small leuk 
esterase, and negative nitrite.  She denies any current urinary 
symptoms.  She received Levofloxacin 750 mg IV.  Culture was 
positive for Enterococcus, but the infectious disease team 
believed this may have been a contaminant.  A repeat urine 
culture is pending.

# Depression: She continued her home doses of Citalopram and 
Bupropion. 

# Goals of care: The ICU attending and team met with the 
patient's family to discuss goals of care.  They elected to 
transfer the patient back to the nursing home so that she can be 
more comfortable and happy.  They will continue antibiotics, and 
make further decisions about care as they arise.

IMAGING:

ECG on admission: Sinus bradycardia. Tiny inferior Q waves could 
represent recent or prior inferior myocardial infarction. Right 
ventricular conduction delay not meeting full criteria for right 
bundle-branch block. J point elevation in the lateral leads. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the findings are 
similar. 

Cardiac catheterization ___ preliminary: 
COMMENTS:      
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 

demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary 
artery 
disease.  The LMCA was a very short vessel with no 
angiographically 
apparent diseas.  The LAD and LCx were both large caliber 
vessels with 
no angiographically apparent disease.  The RCA had minimal 
luminal 
irregularities. 
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided 
filling 
pressures with an LVEDP of 27 mmHg.  There was no aortic 
stenosis noted 
on pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta. 
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a normal ejection fraction 
with no 
wall motion abnormalities.  There was no mitral regurgitation. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery 
disease. 
2. Normal ventricular function. 
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressure. 
4. No aortic stenosis. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
change.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male who presented to ___ for acute 
chest pain at rest, was transferred for code STEMI with mild ST 
elevations in inferior leads and T wave inversions in 
anterolateral leads, and was found to have positive cardiac 
biomarkers and mild luminal irregularities in the coronaries on 
catheterization.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Chest pain/elevated troponin: Unclear etiology of pain, but 
unlikely to be coronary artery disease given that patient denies 
angina symptoms, only cardiovascular risk factor is remote 
tobacco use, and there is no evidence of coronary artery disease 
on catheterization. It is possible that polycythemia ___ could 
have precipitated thrombosis in a distal branch not noted on 
catheterization.  Vasospasm is also a possibility, but there is 
no report of cocaine abuse.  Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy was 
considered unlikely given normal left ventriculogram, and 
unlikely to be myocarditis given patient does not have symptoms 
of congestive heart failure and URI symptoms only started 2 days 
ago with a normal echocardiogram.  Another possibility could be 
pulmonary embolus as patient did have hypoxia on presentation, 
however patient was not tachycardic, Wells score was 0 and 
D-dimer was normal.  Cardiac biomarkers were trended, showing 
elevations in troponin and CK-MB, which were trending down at 
the time of discharge.  Patient was started on aspirin 325 mg 
daily and metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.  Cardiac MR was 
ordered for outpatient workup to further delineate a cause of 
the patient symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.  He was chest 
pain free at the time of discharge.  Close follow-up was 
arranged with a cardiologist, as well as the patient's PCP.  
  
# Pump function: patient appeared euvolemic on exam, with no 
prior history of heart disease.  Echocardiogram revealed no 
abnormalities in heart function.  
.  
# Heart rhythm: Patient was in normal sinus rhythm with 8 beats 
of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight that was 
asymptomatic.  

# Polycythemia ___: patient is currently getting phlebotomy 
every 2 weeks.  He was arranged for outpatient hematology 
follow-up upon discharge.
  
TRANSITION OF CARE
------------------  
Code status: patient is confirmed full code  

Follow-up: patient will require a cardiac MR upon discharge, and 
is scheduled up for follow-up with cardiology.  His cholesterol 
panel returned after discharge and should be followed up by the 
outpatient cardiologist.   He will require follow-up with his 
outpatient hematologist for his polycythemia ___.  He also has 
scheduled follow-up with his PCP.

infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH of DM2, HCV, pancreatic cancer, presenting with 
worsening calf pain and abdominal pain after starting 
gemcitabine/abraxane three days ago.

#Abdominal pain: Patient had worsening pressure-like abdominal 
pain on admission. The most likely cause of the patient's pain 
is his increasing ascites from his pancreatic cancer. He had a 
soft but distended abdomen on physical exam. Ascites was seen on 
bedside ultrasound in the ED but they were unable to find a 
pocket to tap. The patient had never had a paracentesis before 
but he was scheduled for one as an outpatient next ___. 
Though the patient denied subjective fevers, there was concern 
for an infectious process as the patient was febrile to 100.8 
when he arrived to the floor. There is also concern for a 
biliary process as his bilirubin is 2.1 up from 1.0 three days 
ago, but he has no right upper quadrant tenderness on exam. His 
pain could be an adverse effect of his gemcitabine/abraxane, 
which he began three days prior to admission. 

The patient's abdominal ultrasound on ___ showed a known 
portal venous thrombosis. The patient had a diagnostic and 
therapeutic paracentesis on ___ where one liter of fluid was 
removed. His abdomen felt somewhat better after. 

#Fever/healthcare-associated pneumonia: Though the patient 
denied subjective fevers, the patient was febrile to 100.8 when 
he arrived to the floor. Infection or aspiration could not be 
ruled out on his CXR in the ED. Atelectasis was also a possible 
cause. There was also concern for an intra-abdominal cause of 
his fever given his increasing abdominal pain, but he had no 
localizing findings on physical exam. The patient's flu swab was 
negative. A urine culture was negative. Blood cultrues were 
drawn and pending at the time of discharge.

Of note, the patient had elevated WBCs in his ascites from his 
paracentesis. The patient had one dose of empiric ceftriaxone in 
the ED. Given the patient's CXR findings, we started the patient 
on levofloxacin ___ to cover community-acquired pneumonia 
with some HCAP coverage given that the patient has had recent 
chemotherapy. We did not give further coverage for his elevated 
ascites WBC given our low suspicion for intra-abdominal 
infection. The patient was discharged on a 5-day course of 
levofloxacin.

#DVT/Calf pain: On admission the patient complained of chronic 
calf pain that had gotten worse in the prior three days. This 
could have been be an adverse effect of his 
gemcitabine/abraxane, which he began three days prior to 
admission. He had no swelling on exam. There was concern for 
DVT, especially given the patient's malignancy. The patient had 
LENIs on admission that showed bilateral DVTs. He was started on 
a heparin drip and converted to lovenox on ___. The patient 
was discharged with a prescription for lovenox and received 
lovenox training with a ___ interpreter present prior to 
discharge on ___. Of note, the patient already injects his 
insulin and filgrastim at home.

#Anemia: The patient's Hb was 7.1 on admission, down from 8.3 on 
___. There was low suspicion for active bleeding. Hemolysis 
was possible given elevated bilirubin. Anemia could also be 
related to his gemcitabine/abraxane. His haptoglobin was 211 
which suggested that he did not have gemcitabine-induced 
hemolysis. The patient was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs on two 
separate occasions, ___ and ___.

#Hyponatremia: Sodium is 126 on admission, down from 132 on 
___. Possibly due to generalized fluid overload. The 
patient's urine sodium was 77 and osmolality was 635, which 
suggested that he was volume replete. The patient's serum sodium 
remained 127 at discharge.

#Pancreatic cancer: Patient initially on FOLFIRINOX 
chemotherapy, but CA ___ doubling time has significantly 
increased in the weeks prior to admission and there had been 
evidence of progression on imaging and clinically with abdominal 
distension, so the patient was recently started on 
gemcitabine/abraxane by Dr. ___ (C1D1 ___. On the day of 
discharge the patient had a chest CT at the request of Dr. 
___ further staging. During this admission we continued 
the patient's home filgrastim and creon. We continued his home 
supportive medications of oxycodone, ondansetron, and 
prochlorperazine, and loperamide PRN. We also continued his home 
protonix. He was discharged with a follow-up appointment with 
Dr. ___ in the process of being arranged.

#T2DM: The patient has been followed by ___. His chemotherapy 
course has been complicated in the past by hyperglycemia 
requiring adjustments in his insulin regimen. The patient was 
continued on his home lantus 10U QHS and his metformin was held 
and replaced with an insulin sliding scale. He did have some 
hyperglycemia during this admission requiring an extra dose of 
insulin. He was discharged back on his home antidiabetic 
regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital with pain in your legs and 
abdomen. We found that there were blood clots in your legs. We 
started you on a medication to treat the blood clots. This 
medication needs to be injected twice a day. We showed you how 
to do this before you went home.

You had a fever and your chest xray was concerning for a 
pneumonia, so we started you on antibiotics. We are giving you a 
prescription for antibiotics to continue after you go home.

edema.  There is compression and narrowing of the fourth 
ventricle, with prominence of the bilateral lateral ventricles 
suggesting mild/moderate obstructive hydrocephalus.  No 
additional enhancing lesions are identified.  The appearance and 
location of this lesion suggests a possible 
medulloblastoma(desmoplastic variant) in this age group or 
hemangioblastoma.  Another possible etiology of an enhancing 
cerebellar lesion is metastasis.

Surgery
You underwent surgery to remove a brain lesion from your 
brain. 

Frozen preliminary was: Medulloblastoma
Please keep your incision dry until your staples are removed. 
You may shower at this time but keep your incision dry.
It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, 
or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment.
You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your 
activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. 
___ try to do too much all at once.
No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 
No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
***Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

What You ___ Experience:
You may experience headaches and incisional pain. 
You may also experience some post-operative swelling around 
your face and eyes. This is normal after surgery and most 
noticeable on the second and third day of surgery.  You apply 
ice or a cool or warm washcloth to your eyes to help with the 
swelling. The swelling will be its worse in the morning after 
laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. 
You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from 
the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be 
easier during this time. 
Feeling more tired or restlessness is also common.
Constipation is common. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and 
eat a high-fiber diet. If you are taking narcotics (prescription 
pain medications), try an over-the-counter stool softener.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo F with a history of triple negative BRCA1+ 
breast cancer diagnosed in ___. She underwent bilateral 
mastectomy and chemotherapy at that time. She has been generally 
lost to follow-up but was hospitalized recently for shortness of 
breath and found to have recurrence of her cancer.  
 Body imaging showed extensive probable metastases in the thorax 
with adenopathy and numerous pulmonary nodules as well as some 
left lung segment collapse. She did not have large pleural or 
pericardial effusions. The abdomen was benign including the 
liver. Bone scan, however, showed numerous abnormalities 
suggesting skeletal metastases. Widespread skeletal involvement 
is somewhat uncommon in triple-negative cancers, but the bone 
scan compared to prior scans does show a marked change. Her 
tumor marker is mildly elevated. She has some hoarseness, which 
likely reflects left recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement given 
the high concentration of disease in her left upper chest.  

 She now comes in because reports that she has had a severe 
headache and nausea for the past 48 hours. She reports that she 
has been waking up with a headaches every morning this week; 
however, this headache has persisted since yesterday and has not 
resolved. She reports she has been feeling nauseous and has not 
been able to each much. Reports that today she ""vomited up 
bile."" She denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope. 
Reports that she has had difficulty seeing out of her L eye and 
""can only see half a word"" when she reads.  

 In the ED, she had a head CT that showed:  
 There are multiple intracranial metastatic lesions. A lesion in 
the right occipital lobe best seen on series 602 B image 31 
measures approximately 3.1 x 3.1 cm and is complicated by a 
small amount of intralesional hemorrhage. There is associated 
vasogenic edema. Additional lesions are seen, for example and 
extra-axial lesion on series 2, image 23 abutting the inner 
table of the frontal bone in a left para falcine location. A 
small hyperdense lesion at the left parietal vertex is seen on 
series 2, image 25. A lesion abutting the  
 frontal lobe is seen on series 2, image 13 measuring 
approximately 1.4 x 3.7 cm. There is no midline shift or 
downward herniation though there is asymmetric effacement of 
right cerebral sulci compared to the left.  
 She was evaluated by neurosurgery who recommended Keppra, 
Dexamethasone, keeping SBP<140, and MRI scan.  
 
 On arrival to the floor, patient is tired, but otherwise well 
appearing.  
 REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 10 point ROS was performed and was 
otherwise negative.  
 
Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY  
She initially presented in early ___ with a multicentric 
high-grade triple-negative left breast cancer. The largest focus 
of invasive cancer was 5 cm. There was no lymphovascular 
invasion and her four sentinel lymph nodes sampled at the time 
of mastectomy in ___ were negative. The contralateral 
prophylactic right mastectomy was negative pathologically.  
 BRCA testing showed a BRCA1 mutation.  
 Thus, she had an advanced left breast cancer which was 
multifocal but no lymph node spread while the right breast was 
negative. Following recovery from her mastectomy and her 
bilateral ___ flap reconstructions, a port was inserted and she 
began dose-dense cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in early ___. She received four doses of dose-dense cyclophosphamide and 
doxorubicin followed by weekly paclitaxel. Dr. ___ was 
consulted, but did not feel that she required post mastectomy 
radiation therapy based on free margins, the absence of 
lymphovascular invasion and the absence of nodal involvement.  
 Following her chemotherapy there was no additional systemic 
therapy given because of her triple-negative status. We did 
strongly encourage her to have a prophylactic bilateral BSO, but 
she opted to defer that following completion of her other 
therapy. In fact, this was never done and she had a long 
interval where she did not ___ for routine followup here.  
 She was recently seen for shortness of breath. Re-staging 
showed recurrent disease.

EUS
EUS was notable for a 20 cm area of walled off pancreatic 
necrosis
Successful EUS guided cystgastrostomy using an Axios stent with 
placement of two ___ Fr x 5 cm double pigtail stents into the 
cyst cavity

EKG: sinus brady with LAD

CT Abd/Pel notable for
- Necrotizing pancreatitis with a pancreatic fluid collection 
measuring 14.3 x 6.1 x 6.1 cm, slightly larger since ___, consistent with walled-off necrosis.  There is a large 
amount of air within the necrotic pancreas which is likely 
secondary to cigastrostomy vein communication with the stomach, 
however superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
- Poor visualization of the proximal SMV.  Although this may 
simply represent poor opacification due to mass effect from 
large pancreatic fluid collection, proximal vein thrombosis 
cannot be excluded. 

- Inflammatory change and free fluid tracks along the greater 
omentum and 
pools along the superior aspect of the transverse colon, 
measuring up to 5.9 x 1.6 x 2.6 cm.  The adjacent colon appears 
unremarkable. 

- Areas of normally enhancing pancreas are seen in near the 
pancreatic head, body, and tail, as detailed above. 

- Known chronic splenic vein thrombosis. 

Mesenteric Angiogram performed for noted blood in pancreatic 
cyst cavity on follow-on EGD, the angiogram revealed the 
following:
Celiac arteriogram demonstrates irregular appearance of the 
gastroduodenal 
artery without evidence of pseudoaneurysm or active 
extravasation. 

Gastroduodenal artery arteriogram in 2 projections demonstrates 
slightly 
irregular appearance of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, 
but with no evidence of active bleeding. 

Dorsal pancreatic artery arteriogram demonstrates an 
approximately 5 mm 
pseudoaneurysm arising from a branch of the dorsal pancreatic 
artery. 

Dorsal pancreatic artery branch #1 arteriogram demonstrates 
filling of the 
pseudoaneurysm. 

Dorsal pancreatic artery branch #2 arteriogram demonstrates 
filling of the 
pseudoaneurysm. 

Embolization of 2 branches of the dorsal pancreatic artery and 
post 
embolization arteriograms demonstrates no filling of the 
pseudoaneurysm post embolization. 

Splenic artery arteriogram demonstrates no active extravasation 
and no 
retrograde flow to the area of the pseudoaneurysm. 

Superior mesenteric arteriogram demonstrates no active 
extravasation. 
  
Overall Imression:  
  
Pseudoaneurysm arising from a branch of the dorsal pancreatic 
artery 
successfully treated with coil embolization. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  If the patient develops further bleeding, 
repeat 
angiography can be considered, to evaluate for refilling of the 
pseudoaneurysm. Additional angiography can also be performed of 
the 
gastroduodenal artery, which was slightly irregular in 
appearance, but did not have active extravasation on today's 
study. 

Repeat EGD for repeat necrosectomy after embolization: stable 
without evidence of recurrent blood accumulation in cyst sac

Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Co-management by Renal Transplant team.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure to participate in your care.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
You were admitted to the hospital because you had several fevers 
after your recent chemotherapy, and your white blood cell count 
(often a marker of infection) was high.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS HERE?
You had a large investigation into why you were having fevers, 
and were started on antibiotics.  We were unable to find a 
source for this fever, and you did not have additional fevers. 
Your antibiotics were stopped, we watched you for 24 hours, and 
you continued to be stable.  

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GET HOME?
You should continue to take your medications as prescribed, and 
monitor for any fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, 
abdominal pain, diarrhea, or rashes. 

We wish you the best!
Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

IMAGING:
==========
Chest PA/lat ___
1. No pneumonia.
2. Opacity in the left lower lung base is likely due to nipple 
shadow,
however, a focal mass cannot be excluded.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Although likely due to nipple shadows, 
re-imaging with conventional chest radiographs are recommended 
for further evaluation of left lower lung opacity.

Paracentesis ___
Technically successful ultrasound-guided therapeutic 
paracentesis, with
removal of 5 L of straw-colored fluid.

Chest Portable ___
nterval extubation.  Decreased lung volumes with patchy 
bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Crowding of 
the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large 
effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal 
contours are likely stable given differences in patient 
positioning and inspiratory effort.

RUQ US ___:
1.  The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.  
2. The liver has a cirrhotic morphology.  No focal lesions seen. 
 
3.  Large volume ascites. 

CXR ___:
___ to ___.  Increasing retrocardiac opacity, 
suggestive of 
pneumonia or aspiration.  Stable right basal atelectasis.  
Moderate 
cardiomegaly persists.  In the interval, the patient has been 
intubated the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 
approximately 6 cm above the carinal. 

CXR ___:
No acute intrathoracic abnormality. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ EtOH cirrhosis MELD 17 complicated by resistant ascites 
requiring q2wk para, 3 cords of grade I varices ___ who is 
actively drinking presented to the ED with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, s/p endoscopy and banding and management of 
abdominal pain.

#Abdominal Pain: likely from ascites on admission, with 
diagnostic paracentesis completed showing no signs of SBP, 
followed by ___ guided therapeutic paracentesis. Abdominal pain 
controlled initially with oxycodone as needed, and then 
transitioned to tramadol. Her hospital course was then notable 
for a rising bilirubin.
Infectious workup was repeated with blood culture, CXR, and 
peritoneal culture which were all unrevealing. She was 
discharged to complete an antibiotic course for SBP prophylaxis 
in the setting of her variceal bleed as well as for her 
enterococcal UTI. She is discharged with instructions for blood 
work within 1 week  and a follow up with her primary 
hepatologist.

# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive at baseline 90/50's. On 
presentation to ED 80/40's; likely from acute blood loss in 
setting of hematemesis and possible GI bleed versus 
decompensated cirrhosis; patient also has ascites on exam 
concerning for an SBP.  Peritoneal fluid w/ 32 WBCs. Patient was 
transfused 4u on ___ and 1u ___ and maintained on levophed 
initially.  Prior to transfer to medicine floor, she was started 
on 10mg TID midodrine. 

# Upper GI Bleed: patient presented with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, tarry stools, with a history of 
varices/gastropathy/GAVE. Differential diagnosis includes PUD 
vs. variceal bleeding vs. bleeding from GAVE.  Patient was 
started on SBP prophylaxis with ceftriaxone and started on 
octreotide and PPI gtts. On ___, on admission to ICU, EGD was 
performed; banded 2 grade II/III varices during ICU admission. 
She was treated with Octeride gtt, PPI gtt, SBP with 
ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone was continued for 7 day course. Repeat 
blood counts remained stable and she was asymptomatic with 
orthostatic testing. As her hospital course stabilized, she was 
resumed on furosemide and spironolactone. 

# Urinary Enterococcus: Asymptomatic though in setting of 
hypotension concerning for infection. Patient received empiric 
IV vancomycin (___-), which was continued for a 7 day course 
for complicated UTI (last day ___. 
 
# Cirrhosis: MELD 17 ___ C. ___ be decompensated now 
given worsening BPs. Complicated by ascites, varices, 
encepholpathy, abdominal pain. No history of SBP. On 
lactulose/rifaxmin at home although unclear compliance. Diarrhea 
at baseline. Recent cold, no reversal of sleep/wake. Not 
encepholopathic. Actively drinking; therefore not a transplant 
candidate. Patient was continued on lactulose, rifaximin.  
Patient underwent thepareutic paracentesis in the ICU with 
removal of 3L. The Lasix/sprinolactone in the setting of her 
recent active GI bleeding and hypotension, resumed later on the 
hospital course, along with lactuose and rifaximin.

# Coagulopathy: INR 1.4. Plt 77. Around baseling. Likely 
secondary to liver disease and poor nutrition. 

# Alcohol abuse: About a bottle of wine daily. Last drink day 
prior to admission. Tachycardic and tremulous on exam.  Patient 
was placed on CIWA scale, treatment dose IV thiamine was 
initiated along with IV folate and multivitamin.

-Patient to complete enterococcal UTI course on ___
-Patient discharged on tramadol for her chronic abdominal pain, 
repeated paracentesis did not reveal evidence of SBP
- Patient discharged on sucralfate until she is seen in clinic 
follow up
- Patient ordered for CBC, Chem, LFTs to be collected on 
___ and faxed to the liver transplant clinic

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ male with history of renal transplant in ___ who 
presents with subacute kidney injury.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury - 
The patient was admitted with a Cr of 5.3. Renal U/S showed 
moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis, which had worsened over the 
past year. FeNa was 5.5%. Urine culture negative on two 
occasions. The patient had good urine output. A Cudet foley 
catheter was placed with good return. Both Urology and 
transplant nephrology were involved in the case. The etiology of 
the renal failure was thought to be multifactorial: ATN ___ 
recent illness with significant nausea/vomiting during which 
time he continued to take Lasix and losartan with obstructive 
component because the patient had stopped taking terazosin. The 
patient's Cr did not improve during ___ hospitalization. His K, 
which was intially 5.2 responded to Kayexelate and his potassium 
was stable throughout the admission. A repeat renal ultrasound 
showed progression of the hydronephrosis despite a foley 
catheter in place with good return. Cystogram showed a dilated 
collecting system but no ureteral stricture. The patient was 
discharged with a foley in place and urology follow-up the 
following week. He was also discharged to have his renal lytes 
rechecked and with close nephrology follow-up. Terazosin was 
restarted. Lasix and losartan were stopped with the patient to 
take lasix only every ___ day. 
.
# Hypertension- The patient had persistent hypertension during 
this admission. Losartan was held given acute kidney injury. The 
patient was continued on his home diltiazem and nadolol. 
Hydralazine 25 mg tid was started with good response. 
.
# S/p renal transplant- The patient's immunosuppressive regimen 
with prednisone 4 mg qday and imuran 50 mg qday was contiued as 
was calcitriol.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin. 
.
# GERD
- continude PPI
.
# BPH- Thought to have contributed to acute kidney injury. 
Terazosin 3 mg bid was started to be uptitrated as an 
outpatient. The patient was discharged with a foley in place and 
urology follow-up. 
.
# ___- patient has had over 4000 lesions removed. Outpatient 
follow-up with dermatology
.
# DVT prophylaxis with subQ heparin. The patient remained full 
code throughout this admission. Contact was with the patient's 
wife, ___ ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___ - 
___ was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for acute kidney failure. We 
placed a foley to help decompress your bladder and kidney 
collecting system. We performed 2 ultrasound studies of your 
kidneys, which both showed swelling and dilation of your kidney 
collecting system. We also performed a cystogram, that did not 
show any damage to the connection between your kidney and 
bladder. Your renal failure was likely caused by a combination 
of medications, dehydration from your recent illness, and 
possibly from an enlarged prostate. You will go home with a 
foley catheter from the hospital and will see a urologist next 
___ to have this foley removed. You will see Dr. ___ 
___ ___. We also started you on a medication to treat your 
enlarged prostate. 
. 
We made the following changes to your medications: 
We changed Lasix to 40 mg every ___ day. 
We changed Gabapentin (Neurontin) to 300 mg each day because of 
your renal function
We STOPPED Cozaar (Losartan). You may be told to restart this 
medication once your kidney function returns to normal. 
We STARTED terazosin 3 mg twice per day for your prostate.
We STARTED hydralazine 25 mg three times per day for high blood 
pressure (this will likely be stopped once you can restart 
Cozaar). 
We STOPPED ciprofloxacin.
. 
It is also very important that you have your renal function labs 
performed on this ___ to be sure there is no 
worsening of your kidney function and to be sure that your 
potassium is still within a normal range. These labs can be 
drawn close to home and should be faxed to your primary care 
doctor at ___#: ___ at fax#

infection. She was initially treated with IV meropenem and then 
narrowed to cipro based on sensitivities. Blood cultures from 
___ were the only cultures that were positive; ID evaluated her 
and felt she should continue antibiotics with cipro (BID) for 
total course 14 days from first negative blood cx (___). 
Starting on ___, patient should be on PO cipro 500mg q24hrs to 
continue for SBP prophylaxis indefinitely.

IMAGING:
- CXR ___: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiac 
abnormalities

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o HTN, diabetes, and asthma presents with cough, sore 
throat and sensation throat swelling x1 day. 

# Airway swelling: Patient given decadron, diphenhydramine and 
famotidine at OSH for concern of angioedema and upper airway 
swelling, transferred here for ENT and anesthesia evaluation 
should intubation be required. Receieved nebulized racemic 
epinephrine in the ED here. Upon arrival to the MICU the patient 
was subjectively improved. The etiology of his angioedema was 
unclear, but there was concern for contribution of symptoms from 
ACEi. As a result, his ACEi was discontinued while in the MICU, 
and was not restarted upon discharge. He was treated with 
steroids, benadryl, and famotidine. ENT evaulation on the 
morning of discharge revealed resolution of edema and he was 
discharged home from the MICU. 

# Cough/Rhinorrhea: Patient's complaints of cough and rhinorrhea 
recently were most likely due to URI. CXR was without evidence 
of PNA. He was treated with saline nasal spray while in the 
MICU. 

# Tachycardia: Likely in the acute setting of receiving IV 
steroids and epinephrine. Appears to be sinus tachycardia on 
monitor. Troponin from the ED was negative.

# Asthma: Upon arrival to the MICU he was noted to have diffuse 
wheezes on exam. He was given Albuterol nebulizers as needed.

# Diabetes: No active issues. He was discharged on his home dose 
of metformin. 

# HTN: Lisinopril was discontinued upon arrival to the MICU. His 
blood pressure remained within the normal range. He was not 
restarted on any additional anti-hypertensive medications prior 
to discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient will likely need treatment with alternative 
antihypertensive medication, given discontinuation of 
lisinopril. MICU team elected to defer to PCP on this decision.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

 It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization.  You were admitted because of swelling in your 
throat (angioedema) that was causing difficulty breathing.  You 
were admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit so we could 
closely monitor your breathing.  You did very well overnight and 
were treated with steroids, benadryl, and famotidine 
(anti-histamines) which helped to reduce the swelling.  We think 
this swelling was a side effect of your lisinopril.  You should 
not take lisinopril or other medicines in this class (ACE 
inhibitors) ever again as the swelling could happen again 
causing difficulty breathing.  You will need to talk to your PCP 
about starting ___ different blood pressure medicine.  You should 
also talk to your PCP about seeing an Allergy specialist to 
determine if there is another reason for the swelling you had.
  You were also wheezing when you were admitted.  This was 
because of your asthma.  You improved after a treatment with 
albuterol.  Your asthma can be better controlled if you take 
your Flovent inhaler every day - this helps control asthma 
symptoms.  We will give you a prescription for an albuterol 
inhaler that you should only use when you are having symptoms 
from your asthma.

Discharge Instructions:
It has been a privilege to take care of you ___ 
___.
.
You were hospitalized because your heart was beating very slowly 
because of an abnormality in the electrical wiring system of 
your heart; you have a condition known as complete heart block.
.
You underwent an emergency procedure to implant a pacemaker into 
your chest that provides your heart with a regular electrical 
current to ensure that it beats at the correct rhythm. You 
tolerated the procedure well and the pacemaker is functioning 
correctly. This pacemaker will hopefully help to prevent 
recurrence of the fatigue that you have been experiencing.
.
You should avoid raising your arms above your head, and should 
also avoid heavy lifting, for the next several weeks.  Do not 
remove the steri-strips over the site where the pacemaker was 
placed.

Implantation of a pacemaker is surgical procedure, which is why 
you will require antibiotics to prevent infections. The 
following is your antibiotic regimen:
# START: Clindamycin 300 mg every 6h for 1 day
.
Otherwise, your heart regimen is unchanged. Your current heart 
regimen is the following:
# CONTINUE: Torsemide 60 mg twice daily
# CONTINUE: Lisinopril 10 mg daily
# CONTINUE: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual tablet as needed for 
CP
**Take up to 3 tablets 5 minutes apart then call ___ if pain 
does not resolve.**
# CONTINUE: Cholestyramine 4 gram packet daily
# CONTINUE: Ezetimibe 10 mg daily
.
We decreased the dose of your Gabapentin to 300mg daily. This 
dose is based on your kidney function levels.  You can discuss 
the dosing with your primary care doctor next week.

Please continue to take all of your other medications as 
previously prescribed. 
.
Please attend the follow-up appointments detailed below.

===imaging/other data===

XR Abdomen ___:
There is no bowel obstruction or dilated bowel loops.  Moderate 
too severe 
amount of stool within the colon, and rectosigmoid, indicate 
constipation. 

XR hand ___:
No fracture or dislocation is seen.  Mild degenerative changes 
are seen 
involving the distal interphalangeal joints of the second and 
fifth finger as well as the proximal interphalangeal joints of 
the third fourth and fifth fingers.  No bone erosion or 
periostitis is identified. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic 
lesion is identified. No soft tissue calcification or 
radio-opaque foreign bodies are detected.

MRI/MRA Head and Neck ___:
loss FLAIR and diffuse atrophy. 
2. FLAIR hyperintense deep white matter and periventricular 
lesions are 
nonspecific, but likely represent sequela of chronic small 
vessel ischemic 
disease. 
3. Moderate to severe atherosclerotic narrowing at the origin of 
the internal carotid arteries, left greater than right.  No 
additional flow limiting stenosis, thrombosis, dissection or 
aneurysm greater than 3 mm. 
4. Cutaneous lesion at the right inferior occipital scalp 
suggestive of 
sebaceous cyst.

CT TORSO ___:
1. Findings suggestive of left pectoralis muscular injury/tear 
with evolving intramuscular hematoma.  Less likely 
considerations include myonecrosis or abscess. 
2. No evidence of acute fracture. 
3. Obstruction of lingular bronchi by mucous plugging.  Diffuse 
airway wall thickening compatible with bronchitis. 
4. Thickened and hyperemic bladder wall with diverticula 
suggestive of chronic outlet obstruction, perhaps from an 
enlarged prostate.  Correlation with urinalysis, however, is 
recommended to exclude active infection. 
5. Moderate diffuse colonic stool load with a large rectal stool 
ball. 
6. Small hiatal hernia.  Fluid-filled esophagus suggests 
esophageal 
dysmotility.  Enteric tube tip in stomach. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo M with history of intellectual disability, 
HTN, HLD, who presented to the hospital with facial bruising and 
had first time seizure in the ED >15 minutes, and required 
Ativan, keppra, and intubation with propofol drip to resolve. He 
was found to have a UTI which likely contributed to the seizure, 
and had decreased brain volume and atrophy on MRI which lowers 
seizure threshold. He will continue on keppra for seizure 
treatment. 

#Seizure/encephalopathy
The patient was admitted to the NeuroICU on midazolam gtt and 
fentanyl. No further seizure like activity was noted. He was 
continued on Keppra 500 mg BID. He was initially continued on 
broad spectrum coverage for meningoencephalitis, though 
antibacterials were discontinued with an LP showing 1 WBC. He 
was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR negative on ___. 
MRI showed global brain atrophy, without acute lesions or other 
structural problems. EEG showed generalized slowing in the ___ 
hz range with no seizures or epileptiform dischages. He was 
weaned to extubate on hospital day 3. Urine culture from 
admission turned positive, showed >100k CFU EColi, he was 
started on ceftriaxone, however sensitivities showed CTX 
resistance, and he was switched to IV Unasyn on ___. He was 
discharged on augmentin 875mg BID for a total 10 day course 
(ends on ___.

#Hypotension
Home BP medications were held as he had SBP90s while intubated 
on sedating medications. His SBP ran in the 100-110 range after 
extubation, so home medications continued to be held.

# Constipation
On ___ he vomited dinner, and again vomited breakfast on ___. He 
had benign abdominal exam with KUB that showed large amount of 
stool. He received Miralax, bisacodyl, lactulose, milk of 
magnesia, and fleet enema x 2 and had multiple bowel movements. 
He was able to tolerate PO prior to discharge back to nursing 
facility. He was discharged on new medications for constipation.

# Pectoralis tear: CT chest showed an incidental finding of a 
left pectoralis muscular injury/tear with evolving intramuscular 
hematoma. Patient denied pain at that site and had full range of 
motion of the shoulder. Orthopedics was consulted who 
recommended nonoperative management with rest, ice, and pain 
control.

.
IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in position. 
Bilateral
pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Left base opacity 
may represent combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, 
although underlying consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.
.
CT Head ___:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
TTE ___:
.
CXR Portable ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tip of left IJL abuts wall of the upper SVC.
2. Worsening mild to moderate congestive heart failure.
.
EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG study since 
the
background was disorganized and slightly slow consistent with a 
mild
diffuse encephalopathy of non-specific etiology. Superimposed 
frontally
predominant delta activity was seen with stimulation during 
bedside care
and likely represents a pattern of arousal. No epileptiform 
discharges
or electrographic seizures were recorded. This EEG show a 
significant
improvement compared to previous day's recording as background 
frequency
is faster at 7.5 Hz (compared to 5 Hz on the previous day) and 
some
normal sleep morphologies were also noted.
.
Chest Portable ___:
There is new almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe. 
There is no
pneumothorax. Small right and moderate left pleural effusions 
are unchanged. Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left 
side. Left IJ catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC.
.
EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG study. 
Background
was markedly attenuated and slow with admixed faster frontal 
rhythms
that were interrupted by brief periods of marked suppression. 
These
findings are indicative of an underlying moderate encephalopathy 
most
likely related to the effect of sedative medications. The 
background
was reactive in response to physical stimulation. No 
epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures were present.
.
CXR Portable ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube appropriately retracted to 5 cm above the 
carina.
2. Resolution of pulmonary edema.
3. Stable moderate left greater than right bilateral pleural 
effusions.
4. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
.
CXR Portable ___:
.
The feeding tube, left IJ catheter and endotracheal tube are 
unchanged in
position. There is persistent cardiomegaly. There is unchanged 
left
retrocardiac opacity. There are no signs for overt pulmonary 
edema. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion as well. 
Overall, these findings are stable.
.
CXR Portable ___:
The endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right IJ central venous 
catheter are stable in position. There is again seen 
cardiomegaly and left retrocardiac opacity, which is unchanged. 
There are no pneumothoraces or signs for overt pulmonary edema. 
A small right-sided pleural effusion is also present.
.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ___:
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: A video oropharyngeal swallow study 
was
performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow team. 
Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered. The patient could not 
fully
cooperate due to mental status, although limited swallows of 
nectar and
honey-thickened liquids showed no obvious aspiration. Please see 
speech and
swallow note in OMR for complete details.
.
Arterial Duplex Extremity Exam ___:
FINDINGS: Focal exam in the area of trauma was performed. There 
is a large
area of flow interpose between the arterial and venous 
anastomosis. This most likely represents an aneurysmal 
dilatation arising off the draining vein rather than any 
disruption of the anastomosis. There is persistent flow with 
expected waveforms throughout the draining vein up through to 
the subclavian vein. Findings were transmitted to the referring 
physician at the time of initial performance of this scan.
.
CXR PA/LAT ___:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
Small left pleural effusion has decreased substantially since 
___.
Small right pleural effusion or more likely right pleural 
scarring, unchanged. New transvenous right ventricular pacer 
defibrillator lead in standard placement. Moderate cardiomegaly, 
unchanged. No pulmonary or mediastinal vascular engorgement. No 
pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Lungs are grossly clear.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with history of HTN, IDDM, NiCMY, nonobstructing 
CAD, and ESRD on HD admitted after cardiac arrest with cooling 
protocol found to be hypokalemic with chronic prolonged qtc and 
polymorphic VT now extubated and s/p placement of single chamber 
ICD.
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# Cardiac arrest s/p ICD placement: Pt had VT to Vfib arrest at 
dialysis center assessed as being the result of baseline 
prolonged QT interval (chronic per old EKG's obtained from ___) 
in the setting of electrolyte shifts during dialysis, most 
notably hypokalemia. Our thinking was that hypokalemia 
predisposed her to early after depolarizations with R on T 
phenomena making her more likely to have a degenerating rhythm 
due to her long QT. She had a long and eventful hospital course 
including undergoing arctic sun cooling and re-warming, 
successful extubation following prior failed attempt (she 
required re-intubation due to mucous plugging), and gradual 
recovery of her baseline mental status. She required frequent 
work with ___ and speech and swallow to resume PO intake. She was 
dialyzed in-house by the renal team who recommended she be 
dialyzed using a high K bath in the future to maintain her K 
around 5. Additionally, EP was consulted and after a significant 
amount of consideration and deliberation it was determined that 
she would benefit from a single chamber ICD which was placed 
despite concerns regarding her multiple comorbidities. She had 
evidence of significant ectopy on telemetry throughout her 
hospitalization including frequent PVC's and occasional runs of 
NSVT. She was discharged to rehab for continued recovery of her 
physical function. ICD dressing was removed on ___ and steri 
strips should stay in place until after her ICD check on 
___. 
.
# ESRD ON HD: Stable. She was maintained on her MWF dialysis 
schedule with high K buffer with goal K of 5. She did not have 
any significant arrythmias during dialysis but during one 
session she rolled onto the dialysis needle and punctured her 
graft. Doppler study was obtained which demonstrated her graft 
was intact and vascular surgery evaluated and stated it was okay 
for further dialysis. She has a large resolving hematoma 
proximal to the fistula. 
.
# Poor PO Intake/Severe Physical Deconditioning: Pt worked with 
speech and swallow almost daily to enhance her ability to take 
in nutrition by mouth. She was also seen by the nutrition 
service as it was felt she would be aided in her physical 
recovery with improved nutritional status. She was discharged to 
a rehab facility to aid in recovery of her physical functional 
status.
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.
# Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: Stable. She was managed 
in-house on a combination of long acting and humalog sliding 
scale. She is very sensitive to insulin and has had episodes of 
hypoglycemia. 
.
# HTN: Stable. On admission she had an unconventional 
antihypertensive regimen including significant doses of 
clonidine and hydralazine. She was gradually tapered off her 
regimen and it was replaced with carvedilol and lisinopril.
.
# CAD:  History of nonobstructive CAD but without ischemic 
changes on EKG's and without positive cardiac enzymes. She was 
treated with aspirin and atorvastatin as well as her blood 
pressure regimen above.
. 
# Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:  History of 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45%. Her TSH was wnls and 
her HIV negative. She was treated with a heart failure regimen 
including carvedilol and lisinopril.
.  
# Hypothyroidism: Her TSH was wnl's on admission. Her home 
synthroid was held as her history of hypothyroidism was 
questionable and it was unclear if it played any role in her 
cardiac excitability and subsequent cardiac arrest. Following 
her recovery, her TSH was checked once again and was found to be 
3.0 and she was re-started on her home synthroid.
.
# Chronic back pain: Pt with hx of chronic low back pain on 
narcotics as a home med but was oftentimes very somnolent, 
especially when taking these medications so they were 
discontinued. She infrequently complained of pain which was 
treated conservatively with tylenol and ibuprofen. 
.
# Questionable History of Epilepsy: Pt with questionable history 
of epilepsy on keppra as a home medication. She underwent EEG 
testing for >24 hours without any epileptiform discharges and 
there was concern that prior episodes of syncope (cardiogenic or 
otherwise) had been misinterpreted as epilepsy. Her keppra was 
held given her initially cloudy mental status and she did not 
have any seizure-like activity during her lengthy admission. 
Keppra was restarted at discharge but pt should see a 
neurologist in follow up to assess if this medication is truly 
needed. 
.
# Anxiety: Pt described significant anxiety related to her 
medical condition and trivial things such as fear of the dark. 
She was seen by the psychiatry team who recommended small 
standing doses of ativan (a home med) which was attempted but 
oftentimes left her somnolent and difficult to evaluate. These 
medications were held and her mental status improved 
significantly.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
.
#She will need close supervision during dialysis and will need a 
high K bath to maintain K at goal of 5.
.
#She will need device clinic follow-up for her new single 
chamber ICD. Given her severe diabetes and ESRD, she is at 
increased risk of complications related to her device including 
pocket infections and should be monitored carefully.
.
#She will need to AVOID QT PROLONGING MEDICATIONS as these can 
cause a life-threatening arrythmia to occur in her given her 
underlying prolonged QT interval
.
#She will need significant rehabilitation as she is severely 
deconditioned
.
#She will need close follow up with her primary care doctor to 
tackle her ___ social and medical issues. Attempts were made to 
attempt that process by carefully clarifying her home 
medications, elements of her medical history which seemed 
questionable, and addressing her polypharmacy by eliminating 
unnecessary medications.
.
#She will likely need an outpatient social worker to help her 
cope with her multiple medical issues

Imaging:
___ CT Abdomen:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Fat stranding in the root of the mesentery with likely 
reactive lymph 
nodes, findings which can be seen with pancreatitis. 
2. Nodular liver contour and splenomegaly, findings suggestive 
of cirrhosis. 
Please correlate clinically. 
3. Right adnexal cystic lesion measuring up to 5 cm. Further 
evaluation with 
pelvic ultrasound recommended. 
4. Multiple new renal lesions including an indeterminate lesion 
on the right. 
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended. 

___ CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary 
process.
___ CXR:  IMPRESSION: Possibly mild progression of previously 
identified bilateral basal plate atelectasis but no full blown 
findings of ARDS infiltrates 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman w/ ESRD on dialysis, HCV cirrhosis, HTN and chronic 
diarrhea presenting with abdominal pain, fevers, nausea/vomiting 
and ongoing diarrhea. Initially, Ms. ___ was found to have a 
mildly elevated Lipase (239) and CT findings consistent with 
acute pancreatitis and was admitted for treatment and further 
evaluation.

# abdominal pain: The location, quality and time course of Ms. 
___ pain were not classic for acute pancreatitis, however, 
her mildly elevated lipase, fat stranding and reactive LN seen 
of abdominal CT were consistent w/ pancreatitis. There was no 
evident CBD dilation or evidence of stones, and the portal veins 
were open with no evidence of thrombosis. Alcohol and 
gallstones, the most common etiologies for pancreatitis were 
unlikely in this case. Triglycerides were checked and found to 
be within normal limits. The patient was treated conservatively 
for acute pancreatitis, made NPO, given narcotic pain control 
and antiemetics. Over the course of her stay her pain localized 
primarily to the left lower quadrant for which there was no 
clear explanation. She had a bimanual pelvic exam and was found 
to have no adnexal tenderness or cervical motion tenderness. An 
adenexal cyst seen incidentally on CT was on the right and could 
not explain her discomfort. Over the course of her stay, Ms. 
___ pain improved. Her diet was advanced, and she was sent 
home only on her baseline Methadone with no further medications 
for pain control. She may benefit from an outpatient MRCP for 
further evaluation of the cause of her pancreatitis.

# diarrhea: Ms. ___ reports ongoing diarrhea for >6mo. Based 
on OMR records and patient report it appears that work-up to 
date has been negative. The bowel appears normal on CT. The 
patient's diarrhea is secretory based on labs and history of 
large volume diarrhea that occurs throughout the day and night. 
The patient's TSH was found to be suppressed to 0.15 which may 
be contributing. Based on an informal recommendation from 
endocrinology her levothyroxine dose was decreased.
Inpatient work-up including stool cultures and O&P were 
negative. A second O&P is pending at the time of discharge. 
Fecal fat is also pending. Outpatient follow up with the 
patient's gastroenterologist was scheduled for further work-up.

# fever: The patient reported intermittent fevers at home up to 
approximately ___. At the time of admission she was afebrile. 
On hospital day number 2 she developed a fever up to ___ 
accompanied shaking chills. Her dialysis was cut short due to 
concern for sepsis and possible exacerbation of her acute 
pancreatitis. The patient was treated with Tylenol and cooling 
packs and her fever resolved. She had no further febrile 
episodes during her stay. Her fever was most likely secondary to 
her pancreatitis although temperatures as high as ___ are 
unusual with uncomplicated pancreatitis. It may also have been 
attributable to a viral illness. Bacterial infection was ruled 
out by blood culture which was negative x 3 ___s CXR with 
no sign of infection. The patient had no respiratory symptoms. 
Urinalysis and urine culture could not be obtained as the 
patient is anuric. The patient was tested for HIV and was found 
to be negative. She reports recent TB testing (often part of 
work-up related to dialysis) which was also negative per her 
report. 
An adnexal cyst was seen on CT which did not appear consistent 
with an abscess. She had no focal adnexal tenderness on bimanual 
exam and no CMT (pt last sexually active ___ ago). Fever could 
also be explained by malignancy. As the patient was reporting 
malaise and an approximately ten pound weight loss over ___

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting and 
abdominal pain. You had blood tests performed and a CT Scan that 
showed signs of pancreatitis. In the hospital you received 
intravenous fluids, pain control, and were asked not to eat or 
drink. While you were in the hospital you had an episode of high 
fevers that were likely due to your pancreatitis. No other 
source of infection or cause for your fevers was found. Your 
fevers resolved with tylenol and cooling packs. Your pain and 
nausea also improved and your diet was advanced slowly back to a 
regular diet.

While in the hospital you had dialysis for your kidney disease. 
You also had tests performed to evaluate possible causes of your 
diarrhea. No definite diagnosis was made. You should follow up 
with your gastroenterologist, Dr. ___ as scheduled for further 
work-up.

You were discharged home after 7 days in the hospital. On 
discharge, you did not have a fever, your pain had improved and 
you were eating a regular diet. An appointment was made for you 
to follow up with your primary care doctor. You will also see 
your nephrologist, Dr. ___, at dialysis and your 
gastroenterologist, Dr. ___, to further evaluate causes of 
your diarrhea.

Your thyroid stimulating hormone level was found to be low which 
means that you are HYPER-thyroid. This may have played a role in 
your diarrhea. Your LEVOTHYROXINE dose was decreased to 188 mcg 
daily.
You should follow up with your primary care doctor regarding 
your Levothyroxine.

The following changes were made in your medications:
LEVOTHYROXINE decreased to 188mcg daily.

She has a history of hypertension, HCV cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She also has a history of chronic diarrhea, which has been ongoing for over six months. On admission, she was found to have mild tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, but no rebound or guarding. Laboratory results showed mildly elevated lipase and CT findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. She was treated conservatively for acute pancreatitis and her pain improved over the course of her stay. She was also found to have a suppressed TSH, which may be contributing to her diarrhea. At discharge, she was afebrile and her abdominal pain had improved. She was prescribed no further medications for pain control and was scheduled for outpatient follow-up with her gastroenterologist for further work-up. ||endoftext||"

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  During your hospitalization, you had surgery to 
remove unhealthy tissue on your lower extremity.  You tolerated 
the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the 
hospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a 
speedy and uneventful recovery.

LOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS

ACTIVITY 
You should keep your amputation site elevated and straight 
whenever possible.  This will prevent swelling of the stump and 
maintain flexibility in your joint.  
It is very important that you put no weight or pressure on 
your stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal 
properly. 
You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if 
applicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and 
learn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  

MEDICATION
Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!  

You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on 
discharge which  can be very constipating.  If you take 
narcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   
If constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest 
an additional over the counter laxative. 

You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for 
pain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic 
pain medication.  You should require less pain medication each 
day.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  
Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter 
and prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you 
are taking in a day.

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or 
pools until you have permission from your surgeon and the 
incision is fully healed.
After your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub 
the area. 

WOUND CARE:
Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that 
there is no pressure on the stump.    If there is no drainage, 
you may leave the incision open to air.  
Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks.  At 
your followup appointment, we will see if the incision has 
healed enough to remove the staples. 
Before you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to 
replace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be 
fully healed. 

CALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___
Opening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision 

Redness, swelling or warmth in your stump.
Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening 
incisional/stump pain  

NO OTHER PROVIDER, EXCEPT YOUR VASCULAR SURGEON, SHOULD 
DETERMINE IF YOUR STAPLES ARE READY TO BE REMOVED FROM YOUR 
STUMP! 
  
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE 
VASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.   THE 
STAPLES WILL BE REMOVED IN THE OFFICE AT YOUR FOLLOWUP 
APPOINTMENT WHEN IT IS DETERMINED BY THE VASCULAR SURGEON THAT 
THE WOUND HAS SUFFICIENTLY HEALED.

SUMMARY STATEMENT
====================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with PMHx High grade lymphoma 
with burkitt's features s/p cycle 6 R-EPOCH, HTN, HLD, DM, and 
gout who presents with abdominal bloating and weight loss at 
home, found to have refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
confirmed on gastric biopsy, initiated on RICE therapy. His 
course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, ___, and one 
episode of hematuria. Problems addressed during his 
hospitalization are as follows:

#Recurrent Burkitts-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
Patient with high grade lymphoma with Burkitt like features 
refractory to 6 cycles of EPOCH-R therapy last given ___. 
Previously had IGH/MYC rearrangement and no evidence of BCL2 or 
BCL6 rearrangements. Initially presented with weight loss and 
abdominal bloating, CT AP demonstrating gastric thickening s/p 
EGD with biopsy demonstrating high grade B-cell lymphoma (CD20, 
CD10 positive; CD5 negative; ___ ISH negative; Ki-67 
proliferation index near 100%). Subsequent FISH and cytogenetics 
demonstrating pending. Initiated ICE therapy Cycle 1 
___ with rituximab administration ___. 
Received filgrastim ___. Initiated acyclovir for 
prophylaxis. Developed ___ likely in setting of Ifosfamide 
administration (see ___ below), otherwise tolerated with no 
issues. 

#Febrile neutropenia:
Tmax ___, otherwise remained afebrile, no source of 
infection identified. No localizing symptoms other than nasal 
erythema suspicious for HSV which he has had in the past, 
however on acyclovir, improved. CXR clear, elevation in alk phos 
(most likely medication effect), PICC line without suspicion for 
infection, no evidence of cellulitis, fungal markers negative, 
blood and urine cultures negative. Completed 7 day course of IV 
cefepime, discontinued when ___>500 over 3 days.

___:
Cr elevated over several days (Cr peak 2.1; baseline 1.1-1.2). 
Etiology most likely ATN supported by urine with fragmented 
granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells. Likely 
developed kidney injury from large volume autodiuresis (up to 
-3.5L over 24H) and medication effect causing tubular injury 
(Ifosfamide). Cr normalized with IVF to keep net fluid balance 
even. Given sodium bicarbonate for acidosis. Of note, in ___ 
developed tumor lysis syndrome at outside hospital (Cr peak 8.4, 
UA 515), renal biopsy with ATN/AIN requiring temporary dialysis. 


#Hematuria with blood clots:
Reported blood clot in urine x1, otherwise asymptomatic. UA 
unremarkable with no evidence of hematuria x2. Resolved 
spontaneously with no intervention. Possibly from ifosfamide 
administration, of note also has bladder mass on CT performed at 
___.

#Guaiac positive stool:
Intermittent melena on admission, resolved with initiation of 
PPI. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#Anemia:
Hg ___, likely due to lymphoma and bone marrow suppression from 
chemotherapy. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#HTN:
In setting of ATN and large volume autidiuresis, reduced home 
labetalol(decreased from 300 to 200 BID) and home amlodipine 
(decreased from 10 to 5 QD). Remained normotensive with this 
dose reduction.

#Gout: 
Continued home allopurinol

#DM:
Continued home NPH 7 qAM, and ISS, held home glyburide

#Moderate malnutrition:
On presentation reported 3.6% weight loss over 2 weeks. Received 
glucerna BID in between meals.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
[] continue to monitor weight [weight at discharge: 68.3 kg, 
weight at admission: 71.35 kg]
[] continue to monitor hematuria, melena 
[] consider initiation of SSRI

FINDINGS:  
  
Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged at 158ml end-diastolic 
volume (normal to 110ml).   
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a partially reversible 
inferolateral perfusion defect.  Gated images reveal 
hypokinesis, particularly in the inferior territory.  
  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 40%. 
  No prior study for comparison. 
  
IMPRESSION:  1) Partially reversible inferolateral perfusion 
defect. 
  2) Dilated LV end-diastolic volume. 
  3) Decreased LV ejection fraction of 40%. 

___ CT ABD/PELVIS
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Near complete resolution of previously demonstrated residual 
rectal wall
thickening. Focal sacculations just proximal to an area of 
stricture in the
proximal rectum relate to pseudo-diverticula/sacculations, 
largest measuring
up to 3 cm. No evidence of fistula formation on this 
examination.
2. Significant circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening 
may relate to
cystitis versus chronic outlet obstruction.
3. Mild to moderate hydronephrosis of the right pelvic 
transplant kidney,
likely accentuated due to distended bladder.

___ COLONOSCOPY
Diffuse ulcerations and structuring of distal sigmoid and 
proximal and mid rectum. 

___ UE US

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M w/ ESRD s/p DCD renal transplant 
in ___ on cellcept/tacro, s/p MVC ___ yrs ago w/ chronic 
neurogenic bladder c/b recurrent UTIs, HTN, diabetes, and recent 
prolonged hospitalization for septic shock c/b ischemic colitis, 
presenting with abdominal pain. He underwent aggressive bowel 
regimen with large stool burden and had a colonoscopy concerning 
for ischemic colitis. He was seen by CRS with no recommended 
surgical intervention. Course was complicated by UTI with MDR 
e.coli, and he underwent pMIBI which did not identify any 
reversible perfusion defect per cardiology consultation team. He 
will follow up with CRS, cardiology, and transplant nephrology 
as an outpatient and is discharged to skilled nursing facility.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#. Abdominal Pain 
#. Hx of Ischemic/C.Diff Colitis
Patient with imaging initially significant for improving 
colitis, persistent proctocolitis, and large stool burden. 
Abdominal pain though to be most likely ___ to large stool 
burden, so was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen. CRS was 
consulted without acute surgical need. ID was consulted as he 
was scheduled to followup with them as outpatient, who d/c'd his 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl which he was on from his previous course. 
The patient was scheduled for outpatient flex sig, so GI was 
consulted to perform in house. His prep was successful and he 
underwent a full colonoscopy, which was significant for erosion, 
ulceration and strictures, concerning for ischemic colitis, 
along with ? of diverticuli or fistulas. He underwent a CT with 
rectal contrast with no signs of fistulas. He was again seen by 
CRS with no plan for surgical intervention. He was kept on 
standing bowel regimen. MMF dose was decreased due to initial 
concern for MMF colitis but due to low suspicion on colonoscopy 
findings for MMF toxicity this was increased to 500 bid from 
250.

#. ESRD s/p DCD Renal Transplant 
#. Neurogenic Bladder
Renal U/S fairly unremarkable. Creatinine peaked at 1.7 thought 
to be in the setting of pre-renal ___ from large volume diarrhea 
and improved with fluids. He was kept on MMF 250mg BID, tacro to 
1.5 BID,  Bactrim ppx, and home oxybutynin. His home lisinopril 
was held on discharge.

#. MDR E.coli CAUTI
>100,000 CFU of e.coli in UA noted when had leukocytosis. ID was 
consulted who recommended meropenem until ___. He will continue 
po vanc through ___ for c. diff prophylaxis. He was discharged 
on ___ 500 mg q6h. If necessary can switch to ertapenem 1g 
q24hrs per ID consult for dosing convenience.

#. H/o NSTEMI
During last hospitalization had suspicion for type II NSTEMI 
with ischemic bowel, with plan for outpatient cardiac cath. In 
the setting of potential surgical planning, cardiology was 
consulted, who recommended avoiding surgery unless urgently 
needed and to obtain pMIBI which was read as having partially 
reversible perfusion defect but cardiology consult team 
concluded there was no reversible defect. He was continued on 
ASA, rosuvastatin, metoprolol.

#. Acute on  Chronic Back Pain
Seen by chronic pain who recommended continuing home Vicodin 
7.5mg/325mg while in house.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
#. Afib
Currently appears in sinus rhythm. 
Continued Metoprolol for rate control while AC still held due to 
bleeding risk 

#. HTN
- Continued home amlodipine and held home lisinopril as above 

#. DMII
Continued home glargine 32 and standing Humalog 2 with meals

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] While at rehab, will need specific 14 ___ coude catheters, 
which can be obtained from outpatient ___ clinic if unable 
to bring from home

[] He should have labs in 1 week (___) to include tacrolimus 
levels, LFTs, BMP, and CBC.

[] He is discharged with a tacro level of 7.0 on 1 mg bid.

[] Discharged on meropenem 500 mg q6h; for convenience can 
switch to ertapenem 1g daily if preferred

seen by the gastrointestinal (GI) team and the colorectal team, 
who felt that you had a lot of extra stool that was causing the 
pain. You also had a colonoscopy, which showed ulcers and narrow 
areas of your colon. Fortunately, the colorectal surgery team 
did not think you needed surgery. You had a stress test which 
did not show any active areas of decrease blood flow to your 
heart, and the cardiology team concluded that you would not 
benefit from an invasive procedure to look at the vessels of 
your heart. You were also found to have a urinary tract 
infection, for which you are discharged on a course of 
antibiotics through your PICC which will continue through ___. 
You will continue oral vancomycin through ___ to prevent c. diff 
infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented to ___ and Delivery on ___ with loss of 
fluids and breech presentation. Decision made at that time to 
proceed with primary low transverse cesarean delivery. 

Postpartum, her course was complicated by preeclampsia, severe 
by blood pressures. Her serum labs were normal and P:C was 0.28 
on ___. On the evening of ___, she had a sustained severe 
blood pressure requiring one dose of fast-acting nifedipine. She 
was started on nifedipine 30mg daily that day, and after 3 days, 
was transitioned to labetalol 200mg q8h and uptitrated to 
labetalol 400mg po q8h starting ___. She remained asymptomatic 
and well throughout this time.

In addition, she had an episode of non-sustained tachycardia 
over the course of ___, for which complete workup, including 
EKG, repeat labs, and CTA were all reassuring. Etiology was 
thought to most likely be reflex tachycardia from nifedipine 
administration or insufficient oral intake.

Her postpartum course was otherwise uncomplicated. Her pain was 
treated with oral pain medications. She was continued on her 
home levothyroxine. She ambulated and her foley was discontinued 
and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was advanced without 
incident. 

By postpartum day 6, her blood pressures were stabilized in the 
normal to mild-range on an oral antihypertensive regimen. In 
addition, she was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating 
independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. 
She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was then 
discharged home in stable condition with postpartum outpatient 
follow-up scheduled.

- The patient reported leg cramping and a lower extremity 
Doppler was done which showed a DVT. He was started on lovenox. 
A LMWH level was still pending at the time of discharge which 
can be followed up as an outpatient but is expected to be fine 
as he was started on weight based dosing.

Lip Ulcer
- Likely herpes labialis (ie herpes simplex type 1). In context 
of
receiving chemotherapy, discussed with ___ and 
started
acyclovir for both treatment and for suppression.

Elevated ALT
- This has been chronically mildly elevated, potentially from 
methotrexate. Viral hepatitis serologies (Hep B & C) were 
checked and negative.

Anemia
- Likely due to anemia of chronic disease. Iron and vitamin B12 
levels were checked and were unremarkable.

SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS
Other symptoms may indicate that a clot in the leg has broken 
off and traveled to the lung, causing a pulmonary embolism. 
These may include:
* New chest pain with difficulty breathing
* A rapid heart rate and/or a feeling of passing out
This complication may be life-threatening and requires immediate 
attention. Emergency medical services are available in most 
areas of the ___ by calling 911.
Bleeding  Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin can have 
serious side effects and should be taken exactly as directed. If 
a dose is forgotten, the patient should call his/her healthcare 
provider or clinic for advice. 
Patients may bleed easily while taking anticoagulants. Bleeding 
may develop in many areas, such as the nose or gums, excessive 
menstrual bleeding, bleeding in the urine or feces, bleeding or 
excessive bruising in the skin, as well as vomiting material 
that is bright red or dark brown like coffee grounds. In some 
cases, bleeding can develop inside the body and not be noticed 
immediately. Bleeding inside the body can cause a person to feel 
faint, or have pain in the back or abdomen. A healthcare 
provider should be notified immediately if there is any sign of 
this problem. A healthcare provider should also be notified 
immediately if the patient on anticoagulants sustained an injury 
that could lead to bleeding inside the body.
Reduce the risk of bleeding  Some simple modifications can 
limit the risk of bleeding:
Use a soft bristle toothbrush
Shave with an electric razor rather than a blade
Take care when using scissors or knives
Avoid potentially harmful activities (eg, contact sports)
Use appropriate safety equipment (eg, helmets, padding) during 
physical activity
Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal antiinflammatory 
agents (NSAIDS) (eg, ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, Nuprin) 
unless directed to do so by a healthcare provider. Other 
nonprescription pain medications, such as acetaminophen, may be 
a safe alternative.

IMAGING:
-----------
CTA Head ___:
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD: 
The CT angiography of the head demonstrates normal flow in the 
distal cervical internal carotid arteries with marked narrowing 
of both supraclinoid internal carotid arteries with diminished 
flow in the both MCA trunks. Flow is visualized normally in the 
anterior cerebral arteries as well as somewhat diminished flow 
is seen in the posterior circulation. Vascular structures are 
attenuated and it is difficult to evaluate for an aneurysm. 
Extensive collateral vascular structures are seen in the region 
of basal ganglia bilaterally. The superior sagittal and 
transverse sinuses are patent. The vein ___ and ___ 
sinus are also patent. The anterior portions of both internal 
cerebral veins are not well visualized, which could be secondary 
to blood within the third ventricle and focal mass effect.  
IMPRESSION:
1. Head CT shows intraventricular hemorrhage with dilated 
lateral ventricles due to hydrocephalus.
2. CT angiography of the head demonstrates attenuated internal 
carotid
arteries and middle cerebral arteries with collateral 
lenticulostriate
arteries indicative of a moyamoya pattern which could be 
secondary to
vasculitis. The arterial structures are quite attenuated for 
evaluation of
aneurysm, although none is obviously present. Further evaluation 
with
cerebral angiography is recommended. Although no obvious 
aneurysm or
arteriovenous malformation is seen but the conventional 
angiography can
provide better information of the arterial structures.

CT Head ___:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval decrease in the 
amount of
hyperdense blood in the left lateral ventricle and third 
ventricle and fourth ventricle. There has been decrease in 
amount of hydrocephalus in the interval since ___. 
The suprasellar cistern is patent. The basal cisterns are 
slightly narrowed; however, visualized. This demonstrates 
improvement since ___, where the basal cisterns 
were obliterated. A focal area of hypodensity in the right basal 
ganglia (2:11) is noted. Linear hyperdensity in the sulci of the 
left frontoparietal region (2:17) may represent a component of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Bilateral ventricular shunts from a 
frontal approach are stable in place. There has been interval 
resolution of previously seen pneumocephalus. There is minimal 
subcutaneous gas (2:26). There is no sclerotic or lytic bony 
lesion to suggest malignancy. Minimal mucosal thickening in the 
posterior right ethmoid air cells are noted. 
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in intraventricular hyperdense hemorrhage 
and interval
decrease in hydrocephalus and mass effect with interval 
visualization of the basal cisterns, which were obliterated on 
prior exam.
2. Focal hypodensity in the right basal ganglia may represent a 
focal area of infarction. This was not seen on prior exam.

MRI ___
IMPRESSION: Right intraventricular hemorrhage as on the previous 
CT.  
Acute/subacute right periatrial white matter infarct as seen on 
the previous CT examination. Signal changes in the right basal 
ganglia could be due to subacute/chronic hemorrhage. Increased 
signal in the right side of the midbrain probably due to 
subacute or chronic infarct in this location. No other acute 
infarct seen. Other findings as above. 

MRA OF HEAD: ___
Head MRA demonstrates bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid 
artery flow 
signal narrowing indicative of occlusive disease. The middle 
cerebral 
arteries are not fully visualized. Similar findings were seen on 
the previous CTA examination. In the posterior circulation, 
basilar artery is well visualized but diminished flow signal is 
seen in both posterior cerebral arteries. 
IMPRESSION: The MRA appearance has not significantly changed 
since the 
previous CTA examination. Diminished flow is seen in both middle 
cerebral 
arteries secondary to supraclinoid occlusive disease. 

U/S abdomen:
___
IMPRESSION: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound without 
evidence of 
cholecystitis or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation. 
  
CT HEAD ___: s/p removal of EVDs
IMPRESSION: 
1. Stable appearance of right ventricular hemorrhage, with blood 
products 
layering dependently in the occipital horn of the right lateral 
ventricle. No new hemorrhage. 
2. Stable ventricular size.

EEG: ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to wide and 
sudden 
fluctuations between theta frequency slowing and higher voltage 
rhythmic 
delta frequency slowing. At least one of these periods of delta 
slowing 
seemed to respond to stimulation suggesting that it might be 
related to 
level of alertness. This level of slowing could also, however, 
be 
metabolic or due to other encephalopathies. There were no 
epileptiform 
features on this recording. 

___: LENIs performed for ___ pain and showed: no evidence of 
DVTs

 
Brief Hospital Course:
**The patient underwent emergent bilateral EVD placement in the 
Emergency Department and was then admitted to Neurosurgery. 
Following successful placement, she was transferred to the ICU 
for close monitoring and Q1 neuro checks. A cerebral angio 
performed that evening confirmed the presence ___. She 
was put on mannitol 25g Q6 for edema, which was weaned down on 
___ to 12.5mg Q6 and has subsequently been weaned off. The EVDs 
were kept patent with TPA flushing.  

**On ___ her EVD's were raised to 20 and on ___ her Left EVD was 
clamped and her Head CT was stable.  Overnight on ___ into ___ 
she was febrile and became more lethargic.  Her L EVD was 
subsequently opened on ___ and a Head CT was done which showed 
unchanged IVH and slowly evolving subacute R basal ganglia and 
superior parietal lobe infarcts.  

**On ___ she continued to be febrile and her L EVD was again 
clamped with her R continuing to be open at 20.  On ___ her 
exam began to improve as she was oriented to self and that she 
was in the hopsital.  Her Left EVD was removed and her Right was 
rasied to 25.  CSF was also sent for studies.

**On ___ patient's EVD was clamped for a trial. Patient's ICPs 
overnight ranged from ___. She was also being transitioned to 
Keprra for antiseizure coverage due to elevated LFTs. A speech 
and swallow evaluation was declined because of patient's 
lethargy. A PEG was placed on ___ without complications and 
patient will remained NPO  until ___. Her exam is stable, EVD 
was removed and CSF cultures were sent. 

**On ___ patient was lethargic, arousable only with constant 
noxious stimuli. Patient making eye contact and spontaneous with 
RUE, but no commands or mouthing of words. Head CT showed more 
prominent ventricles, but no hydrocephalus. 

**She was then transferred to the Neurology Stroke Service on 
___. Exam significant for abulia, tracking, left hemiplegia. 
MRI/MRA was repeated and showed  Right intraventricular 
hemorrhage as on previous CT scans.  Acute/subacute right 
periatrial white matter infarct as seen on the previous CT 
examination (___). Signal changes in the right basal ganglia 
could be due to subacute/chronic hemorrhage. Increased signal in 
the right side of the midbrain probably due to subacute or 
chronic infarct in this location. MRA showed bilateral 
supraclinoid internal carotid artery flow signal narrowing 
indicative of occlusive disease. The middle cerebral 
arteries were not fully visualized. Similar findings were seen 
on the previous 
CTA examination. In the posterior circulation, basilar artery is 
well 
visualized but diminished flow signal is seen in both posterior 
cerebral 
arteries. 

**She was then weaned off of Keppra and EEG repeated showing no 
seizure activity. She remained afebrile after ___. Cultures 
only revealed yeast in urine, but blood and CSF were negative. 
Abdominal U/S negative despite elevated LFTs. Patient was anemic 
and sickle cell screen was negative. Platlets elevated, but 
hematology team not concerned and they trended downwards. LENIS 
negative for DVT on ___. 

**On ___, MS exam improved. She was vocalizing, following 
all commands with continued left hemiplegia. She was seen by 
speech and swallow and cleared to have thin liquids, ground 
solids with one to one monitoring. CXRAY should be repeated 
___ to check for silent aspiration. Labs in terms of 
transaminitis and thrombocytosis improving. She was afebrile for 
over 72 hours. 

**Family Meeting conducted ___ and she will be discharged to 
rehab. 

**Patient will have outpatient follow up with Dr. ___, 
___ to consider vascular bypass and Dr. ___ in 
stroke clinic. Neurosurgery followup should also be arranged as 
detailed below. 
  
NUTRITION:
**Patient had PEG placed on ___, was tolerating tube feeds 
at 50ml/hr.  However electrolytes (Ca, Mg, Phos) were elevated 
on ___ following water restriction for suspected SIADH.  
Please follow up electrolytes on ___ and consider a 
lower-osmolarity nutrition preparation should Ca, Mg, Phos

50% stenosis. There is also distal 30% stenosis.
* Left Anterior Descending
The LAD is free of significant disease.
* Circumflex
The Circumflex is free of significant disease.
* Right Coronary Artery
There is a 90% stenosis in the Proximal RCA. The lesion has a 
TIMI flow of 3 and has mild calcification noted. This lesion is 
further described as diffusely diseased. An intervention was 
performed on the Proximal RCA with a final stenosis of 0%. There 
were no lesion complications.

Interventional Details
Given the culprit RCA stenosis we opted to proceed with PCI and 
address the left main disease with subsequent interrogation. A 6 
___ JR4 provided fair support. A Prowater wire was advanced 
to distal RCA. The lesion was predilated with 2.0 x 20 and then 
2.5 x 15 balloon at ___ ATM. WE were unable to deliver a 
single 2.5 x 32 Promus ___ end deployed a 2.5 x 20 and 3.0 
x 20 Promus DES at 14 ATM. The distal stent was post-dilated 
with the delivery balloon at 16 ATM. The overlap and proximal 
stent were post-dilated with 3.25 x 15 NC balloon at ___ ATM. 
There was no residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is an ___ lady, speaking only ___, with 
___ gastric cancer (diagnosed ___, currently on ramucirumab 
alone (held following surgery) and arthritis, who presented with 
a hip fracture after a fall from standing height.  

===ACUTE ISSUES=== 
#Hip fracture:  
#s/p Fall:  
Presented after a fall from standing height and found to have a 
right intertrochanteric hip fracture with varus angulation. CT 
head with subgaleal hematoma but no intracranial hemorrhage, and 
CT C spine negative for traumatic injury. Fall appears to be 
purely mechanical secondary to underlying neuropathy and 
progressive weakness with possible acute decompensation in the 
setting of pneumonia. She had no LOC, but may have an 
orthostatic component as well contributing to lightheadedness 
given poor PO intake. Troponins obtained for pre-op workup were 
slightly elevated x3 (max 0.03). Likely ___ slight ___, EKGs w/o 
e/o MI. 

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service with 
a right hip fracture. The patient was taken to the operating 
room on ___ for right hip ORIF, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given ___ antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient worked with ___ who 
determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
weight-bearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity, and 
will be discharged on ___ for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough discussion was 
had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or 
return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The 
patient was also given written instructions concerning 
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care. 
The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

 
#LLL pneumonia: CXR obtained on pre-op workup showed LLL 
opacity. Unclear if she had a true clinical pneumonia given she 
so did not have symptoms of pneumonia, but fall could be due to 
weakness in the setting of infection. Did not meet criteria for 
HAP. Treated with five day course of ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin. 
 
===CHRONIC ISSUES===
#Gastric cancer: 
Diagnosed ___. Treated with 5 cycles on folfox, followed by 
taxol/ramucirumab for 5 cycles (C5 D1 and ___. Seen by 
oncologist Dr. ___ on ___ who recommended stopping 
taxol and proceeding with ramucirumab alone due to concerns that 
the taxol was causing worsening neuropathy and interfering with 
her quality of life. Of note, ramucirumab was held following her 
operation. Will need outpatient evaluation and discussion of 
goals of care to determine further treatment course. In 
addition, patient had therapeutic paracentesis while inpatient 
on ___.

#GERD: Continued home omeprazole BID.  
#Hypertension: Held spironolactone given elevated creatinine at 
___ initially, restarted on ___.
#Depression: Held home citalopram for prolonged QTc. Lower dose 
may be safer for age.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN):
1. Moderately distended gallbladder with mural edema and 
dependent stones, 
early acute cholecystitis should be considered. HIDA scan could 
be performed for confirmation if desired. 
2. Cholelithiasis. 

MRCP (MR ABD ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Appearance consistent with hepatic edema, likely hepatitis. 
2. Abnormal gallbladder with marked gallbladder wall edema and 
gallstones, 
but the gallbladder is somewhat decompressed, suggesting this is 
secondary to hepatitis rather than cholecystitis. 
3. No common bile duct stones. 
4. Minimally complex cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney. 
foolow up in 6 months initially with ultrasound is recommended, 
though this may need MRI follow up. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented to the Emergency Department on ___ with acute onset periumbilical pain.  An abdominal 
ultrasound was suggestive of a 
'moderately distended gallbladder with mural edema and dependent 
stones; early acute cholecystitis should be considered' and 
cholelithiasis; LFTs were also elevated upon admission (T. bili. 
2.9)  While in the ED, intravenous fluids, pain/ nausea 
medication and intravenous antibiotics were administered.  He 
was subsequently admitted to the Acute Care Surgical service for 
ongoing management.  

Upon admission, the patient underwent an MRCP for evaluation of 
possible choledocholithiasis given elevated LFTs.  The MRCP was 
notable for 'appearance consistent with hepatic edema, likely 
hepatitis, abnormal gallbladder with marked gallbladder wall 
edema and gallstones' without evidence of common bile duct 
stones.  Additionally, a minimally complex cyst in the lower 
pole of the left kidney was noted with follow recommended in 6 
months. 

On HD2, an ERCP was attempted, but unsuccesssful due to 
Roux-en-Y anatomy.  Post-procedure, the patient's abdominal pain 
improved and LFTs trended downward suggesting passage of stones. 
 He was subsequently taken to the operating room on HD3 where he 
underwent a laparascopic cholecytectomy; see operative note for 
details.  Post-operatively, the patient remained afebrile with 
stable vital signs; intravenous antibiotics were not resumed.  
His diet was advanced to regular and well tolerated.  
Additionally, he was voiding adequately and ambulating 
independently.  He was subsequently discharged to home on POD1 
and will follow-up in ___ clinic in 2 weeks. Of note, while in 
the PACU, a pilonidal cyst without erythema was noted, which per 
patient, is chronic.  The patient was instructed to continue 
current management of dry dressings prn with regular inspection 
of site.  Warning signs were reviewed with patient with 
perceived good understanding. He will follow-up with his primary 
care provider for ongoing management.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___.

What happened while you were in the hospital?
- You were admitted because of chest pain, sweating, and a 
clammy feeling 
- You were given sublingual nitroglycerin to decrease the amount 
of blood going to your heart to decrease the stress on your 
heart, this improved your chest pain significantly
- An EKG was done to monitor how your heart was beating, it 
showed some concerning changes
- A troponin level was checked; this is an enzyme that is 
released from your heart cells when your heart muscle is in 
danger. The troponin level was elevated which was concerning
- Your heart was monitored throughout your stay with a telemetry 
monitor, there were no concerning events
- You were started on aspirin, heparin, ticagrelor. These 
medications are blood thinners and are meant to improve blood 
circulation in your heart vessels 
- You were started on atorvastatin which helps decrease 
cholesterol and improve heart function 
- An echo/ultrasound was done to assess your heart function 
which showed your heart is functioning well 
- A catheterization of your heart vessels was done which showed 
significant occlusion in one vessel. Two drug eluding stents 
were placed and blood flow was restored 
- Your HbA1c was checked which is used to measure your average 
blood sugar over three months. The result was 6.5, normal is 
<5.7. For the past three months, your average blood sugar as 
been 140. You were started on a new medication to improve your 
blood sugar. Please recheck your HbA1c in three months to ensure 
improvement

What to do after discharge?
- Follow up with your cardiologist to ensure everything is going 
well
- Continue taking the medications as prescribed, this is very 
important. Your new drug eluding stent will get occluded if you 
miss as little as one dose
- Follow up with your primary care doctor for diabetic 
education, including nutrition education

- Your new medications include:
1. Aspirin 81mg daily (blood thinner- you will be on this 
medication indefinitely 
2. Ticagrelor 90mg every 12 hours (blood thinner- you will be on 
this medication for at least ___ year
3. Metformin 500mg every 12 hours for the first week, then 
increase your morning dose to 1000mg followed by 500mg 12 hours 
later (diabetes), initially this may cause nausea, diarrhea and 
stomach upset- you will be on this medication for at least 3 
months pending your next HbA1c
4. Atorvastatin 80 mg every night before bed, this is replacing 
your simvastatin 20mg- you will be on this medication 
indefinitely 
5. Metoprolol Succinate 50mg, this is replacing your Atenolol 50 
mg daily- you will be on this medication indefinitely
6. Nitroglycerin .3 sublingual up to 3 times as needed for chest 
pain, call your PCP or go to the ED immediately if the chest 
pain does not resolve 

We are happy to see you feeling better.

output, mild dull headache, blurry vision, and soreness in the 
lungs when taking deep breaths.  He reports for the last several 
months he's had SOB when walking even a half block.  He needs to 
stop and rest to catch his breath.  Twice in the last two days 
he's continued to walk despite the SOB and had visual 
hallucinations (one of a bird that was not there and one of a 
dog that was not there).  
  
On arrival to the ED VS were T 96.8 BP 84/48 HR 55 RR 16 02 sat 
97% on 3L.  While in the ED BP dropped to 71/40 with improvement 
of SBP to the low 100s after IVF. He had a total of 3L of NS in 
the ED.  His neuro exam was non-focal in the ED and CT of the 
head was negative.  A CT abdomen and pelvis was notable for a 
moderate pericardial effusion, pulsus was 4, and echo showed no 
evidence of tamponade.  A CXR had some questionable haziness and 
patient given zosyn 4.6g IV x1 and vancomycin 1g IV x1.  Two 
peripheral IVs were placed.  Creatinine was notably 4.5 (up from 
1.5) and UA was negative.  Nephrology transplant was consulted 
and requested a tacrolimus trough and urine lytes.  Hepatatology 
and transplant surgery were made aware of the admission.  Vitals 
prior to transfer were: 57 104/57 RR14 96% on 3L.  
  
Review of systems:  
Pertinent negative include: no new tingling, no slurring of 
speech, no one sided weakness in the legs (felt more weak 
recently), no dysuria, no hematuria,

Radiology:

Transthoracic echocardiogram (___):
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
is a small-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion. The 
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or 
other cellular elementswith nearly no free flowing elements. 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with 
the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the findings are 
similar.

Unilateral upper extremity doppler ultrasound (___):
Echogenic linear structure, the appearance of which is 
suggestive of a foreign body or less likely a retracted clot 
within the right basilic  vein in the right upper arm. Further 
imaging with plain film radiograph is suggested.

X-ray, right upper extremity (___):
Unremarkable appearance of the right elbow. Vascular 
calcification.

CXR ___ --> at discharged):
A left subclavian line tip is at the junction of the 
brachiocephalic vein and SVC. The two endovascular stents: SVC 
and right subclavian vein catheter are in place. 
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. There is 
still present left small-to-moderately and right small pleural 
effusion that appears to be improved compared to ___. 
There is also some improvement in the bibasilar aeration, in 
particular in the left lower lung. Compared to the study from 
the beginning ___ for example), cardiac 
silhouette appears to be decreased most likely due to at least 
partial resolution of pericardial effusion. There is no 
pneumothorax.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a very nice ___ gentleman admitted with 
SOB, lightheadedness, emesis, and vague visual hallucinations, 
found to be hypotensive, in acute renal failure, and with 
pericardial and bilateral pleural effusions. 

HYPOTENSION:  He was mildly fluid responsive in the ED from SBP 
of ___ to ___. Lactate was 0.9 and WBC was normal.  Urine 
lytes showed FeNa - 0.89, consistent with a pre-renal picture.  
Once in the ICU, arterial line was placed and he was given 3L NS 
with good response.  His home dilt, doxazosin, flecainide, 
methocarbamol, metoprolol, oxycontin were held in the setting of 
hypotension.  His pressures normalized quickly.  His home 
lopressor was kept on-board given his a-fib with RVR (see 
below).  Hypotension was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia. 
 Upon transfer to the floor, patient remained hemodynamically 
stable, with systolic pressures in the 100s-120s.  

AFIB WITH RVR:  Patient's home meds were initially held on 
admission given hypotension.  He developed a-fib with RVR, which 
was difficult to control.  On the floor, cardiology was 
consulted who helped titrate his regimen.  Upon transfer to the 
MICU, patient was on: dilt 60mg QID, flecanide 50mg BID, and 
metoprolol 50mg BID.  The metoprolol had been down-titrated in 
setting of obstructive pulmonary disease, and concern for 
excessive beta-blockade.  Mr. ___ will need to follow-up with 
Dr. ___ outpatient management of afib with RVR.  His 
anti-arrhythmic regimen has been adjusted and current doses 
inclued metoprolol tartrate 150mg twice daily, flecainide 100mg 
twice daily, and diltiazem SR 240mg once daily.

___:  Patient is s/p kidney transplant in ___.  Creatinine of 
4.5 up from 1.5 on ___.  Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal 
etiology.  Creatinine improved with IV fluids (down to 2.4 on 
___.  On the floor, creatinine continued to be in flux, but was 
usually fluid responsive and trended to baseline of 1.1 at time 
of discharge.

PERICARDIAL EFFUSION / PLEURAL EFFUSIONS:  Unclear etiology.  
Cardiology was consulted who recommended serial echos to 
evaluate evolution/resolution of effusion.  Daily pulsus was 
checked, usually ranging from ___.  Pericardial fluid did not 
seem to affect patient in any signficant manner; differential 
diagnosis included: malignant, infectious, and rheumatologic.  
The plan was to perform pericardiocentesis for fluid analysis 
which unfortunately did not reveal an underlying etiology. 
Patient also underwent right and left-sided thoracenteses, for 
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  Extensive work-up for 
autoimmune causes, infectious (including TB, by way of serum 
quantinterferon gold and pericardial fluid mycobacterial 
culture) causes, and malignant causes (pericarial tissue biopsy, 
pericardial and pleural fluid cytologies), was negative.  The 
patient will follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist for 
repeat TTE in 2 weeks.  Additionally, he will see Dr. ___ in 
infectious diseases clinic for follow-up of multiple infectious 
tests, still pending at time of discharge. Imaging at time of 
discharge shows a small pericardial effusion with no tamponade 
physiology on echocardiogram and small right-sided pleural 
effusion on CXR.

VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS/CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  No focal neuro 
deficits.  Originally thought to be from medications such as 
gapapentin, muscle relaxants, and oxycodone.  These medications 
were discontinued upon admission to ICU, and they have continued 
to be held given concern of over-sedation and hypercarbic 
respiratory failure.  His mental status is back to baseline - 
AAOx3, no encephalopathy or cognitive or concentration deficits.

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY SWELLING: patient has known SVC and right 
subclavian vein stents.  Vascular was consulted and recommended 
for outpatient follow-up for consideration of CT venogram.

PROPHYLAXIS: subcutaneous heparin.

CODE STATUS: full code.

Blood Cultures routine and mycolytic NGTD at time of D/C

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic.

was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

Conclusions   
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is 
seen in the left atrial appendage. A small patent foramen ovale 
is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
to moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. 
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion. 

 Post Bypass: Patient is A paced on milrinone vasopressin and 
norepinepherine infusions. Thee are smooth contours in the 
aortic root consistent with a conduit. Laminar flow is seen in 
the aortic root and ascending aorta. The aortic valve appears to 
be native tissue and now has trace to mild central aortic 
insufficiency s/p resuspension. Peak aortic valve gradient 11, 
mean 5 mm Hg. Aortic valve pressure half time >800 ms. ___ 
contours otherwise intact after cannula removal. Remaining 
examination is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons 
at the time of the exam.

carotid endarterectomy, which went well without complication 
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the 
floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and oxycodone 
for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received oxycodone and tylenol with good 
effect and adequate pain control.  

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. An artertial 
line was initially placed for close blood pressure monitoring. 
He was continued on all home medications including beta-blocker. 
Home ace-inhibitor was restarted POD1.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Foley catheter 
was removed at midnight POD0 and the patient voided. Following 
foley catheter placement, hematuria was noted. It cleared over 
the postoperative course. Urology recommended the patient be 
seen by his outpatient urologist given his history of bladder 
cancer. This was commnunicated to the patient and his wife and 
daughter directly.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection.   

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required. INR was checked POD1 
after coumadin was held POD0. It was restarted on his home 
dosing regimen POD1. Communication with his PCP who manages his 
coumadin as an outpatient was made prior to discharge and 
followup INR check and coumadin dosing was established. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Pertinent Results:
___ TEE
Pre-bypass:
 The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic 
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion. There is a minimally increased gradient 
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are 
myxomatous. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen with 
posterior leaflet redundancy and prolapse. This affects P3 the 
most but is present throughout the posterior leaflet.. Due to 
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no 
pericardial effusion. Findings communicated at time of incision.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old woman with PMH of left femoral to ___ 
bypass (___) for a non-healing second toe amputation site and 
___ toe ulcer. During admission with Podiatry for a third toe 
amputation in ___, ultrasound demonstrated that the left SFA 
and the bypass graft were occluded, but since her second toe amp 
site had healed and ___ toe ulcer improved it was decided that 
redo bypass would not be attempted at that time. Upon returning 
to clinic on ___, the patient was found to have a new left 
second toe ulceration as well as a left first hallux blister 
with drainage, in addition to her non-healing ___ toe ulcer, and 
that pain from these wounds was limiting her ambulation. It was 
decided she would ultimately require a revision of her bypass 
graft after a bilateral lower extremity angiogram. 

The patient presented to ___ on ___ for a bilateral lower 
extremity angiogram. Procedure was uncomplicated, and 
demonstrated occlusion of the left SFA, bypass graft, and 
popliteal artery. It also demonstrated occlusion of the right 
SFA and popliteal artery. The patient went to PACU 
post-procedure in good condition, and after a brief, uneventful 
stay was transported to the floor. She was admitted to the 
Vascular Surgery service overnight for monitoring. 

On the morning of POD 1, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. Her groin access site was soft, with no evidence of 
bleeding or hematoma. She had dopplerable DP and ___ pulses in 
her right foot, and a dopplerable ___ pulse in her left foot. No 
DP pulse could be obtained on her left foot, which was unchanged 
from immediately post-procedure. The patient was discharged home 
without services. The patient unfortunately eloped from the 
hospital as her discharge papers were being completed, so she 
did not receive formal discharge teaching with nursing. Her 
nurse was notified the patient was eloping, and the patient 
allowed her nurse to remove her ___ in the hallway. The patient 
will return to the hospital on ___ for a 
planned readmission for left re-do left femoral to posterior 
tibial bypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service due 
to inability to tolerate POs. He was tachycardic at initial 
presentation thought to be due to dehydration as well as the 
pain and discomfort of his obstruction. This tachycardia had 
resolved prior to discharge with fluid resuscitation as well as 
Roxicet medication. 

On HD 2, the patient underwent EGD which showed a large gastric 
mass circumferentially at the GE junction across which an 
esophageal stent was successfully deployed. Biopsies were also 
taken as the biopsies from the OSH, although showing malignancy, 
were still undeterminate as to of which origin. 

He did well post-procedure and was able to tolerate a full 
liquid diet after the stent placement. Pain control also 
improved with liquid oxycodone-acetaminophen. 

At discharge, he was tolerating a full liquid diet including 
Ensure for nutritional support and was no longer tachycardic. He 
was much more comfortable with pain well controlled on Roxicet. 
He will follow up with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ oncology and 
appointments have already been made.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to pre-op/Emergency Department on ___ 
. Pt was evaluated by anaesthesia/ Upon arrival to ED.  Given 
findings, the patient was taken to the operating room for 
ex-lap,washouts,flap advancement w/ surgimend and wound VAC 
placement. There were no adverse events in the operating room; 
please see the operative note for details.  Pt was extubated, 
taken to the PACU until stable, then transferred to the TSICU 
for observation.

On POD1, patient has been persistently tachycardic up to 130's, 
however urine output has been adequate. NG tube was removed. 
Over night, he has agitated and delirious that required 1 dose 
of IV Haldol. Patient started on broad spectrum IV antibiotics 
to treat abdominal sepsis and pneumonia and IV fluconazole 
prophylactically. 

POD2, he has multiple loose bowel movement which was positive 
for C.diff, IV flagyl and PR vancomycin has been started. He 
also stayed delirious during the day. He has been taken to the 
OR again for washout/VAC changes and went back to the TSICU and 
this time he kept intubated and was HD stable over the night. 

POD3, Patient was extubated but remained delirious. POD4, his 
over all delirium issues has been improved, CT abdomen/Pelvis 
done which was negative for any perforation or fluid 
collections, he has taken back to the OR for wash out/VAC 
changes. 

POD5, his heart rate went high, up to 133 with irregular rhythm, 
multiple 5mg metoprolol doses have been given that managed the 
heart rate perfectly, IV 5mg metoprolol was started q6h standing 
dose daily that stopped completely a few days later. 

On ___, he has taken back to the OR for another wash out 
and VAC changes and then transferred to the regular floor after. 


During stay on regular floor the hospital course has been 
described systematically as follow:   

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented on the floor; pain was 
managed perfectly with IV pain medicine that transitioned to 
oral once tolerating a diet.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Metoprolol has 
been stopped and heart rate remain stable.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged.

GI/GU/FEN: Initially he was NPO and on TPN. The diet was 
advanced sequentially to a Regular diet, which was well 
tolerated, subsequently TPN has been stopped. Patient's intake 
and output were closely monitored

ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched of which he 
was afebrile through out hospitalization. Patient switched to PO 
Flagyl and kept on C.Diff treatment for 15 days after discharge 
with PO Vancomycin as well.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery.  

ACTIVITY: 
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency. 
- You may climb stairs.  
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- Don't lift more than 10 lbs for 6 weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
- You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming. 

HOW YOU MAY FEEL:

to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. 
- You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed. 
- You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing. 
- All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon. 

YOUR BOWELS: 
- Constipation is a common side effect of medicine such as 
Percocet or codeine. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription. 
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon. 

PAIN MANAGEMENT: 
- It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"".  
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. 

-You will receive a prescription from your surgeon for pain 
medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine 
as directed.  
- Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take 
more medicine at one time than prescribed. 
- Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe. 
- Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay. 
- If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine. 
- Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises. 
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours

of her R hip pain. She states that she had which he thinks his 
heart failure in the past, although thinks that it was 
associated with an episode of pneumonia, so was not sure. Has 
lost significant amount of weight due to loss of appetite over 
the past year.  

 During ED course, had a transient desaturation to 88% on home 
O2 settings with sensation of dyspnea. Nasal cannula has been 
increased, she has improvement in her dyspnea.  
 In the ED, initial VS were:  T98.3, HR 70, BP 133/58, RR 18, O2 
94% Nasal Cannula. She had desatted to 88%, which improved with 
uptitiration of NC.

Patient was initially transferred to the floor. On the floor her 
K was 6.7. She developed peaked T waves on arrival to the floor. 
She received Calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose. Nephrology was 
consulted for emergent dialysis and patient was transferred to 
the ICU for initiation of HD. Patient was hypoxic to 84% on 5L, 
which improved with uptitration of O2 to 6L. 

On arrival to the MICU patient reports that her breathing has 
improved. She can tell that she has extra fluid and thinks that

RADIOLOGY
=========
___ CXR PA LAT
FINDINGS: 
Evaluation is somewhat limited due to lordotic positioning and 
patient
rotation.  Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta 
is diffusely
calcified and mildly tortuous.  Lung volumes are low which 
accentuates the
width of the superior mediastinal contour.  Increased 
interstitial opacities
are noted diffusely which suggests a chronic interstitial 
abnormality, though
mild interstitial pulmonary edema is not excluded.  No focal 
consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The osseous 
structures are
diffusely demineralized. Irregularity of the left second and 
third lateral
ribs may reflect fractures.   Height loss of 2 vertebral bodies 
at the
thoracolumbar junction are of indeterminate age.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to positioning and patient rotation.
2. Diffuse interstitial opacities could suggest a chronic 
interstitial lung
disease with mild interstitial pulmonary edema not excluded.
3. Irregularity of the left second and third lateral ribs 
suggestive of
fractures.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion clearly seen.
4. Compression deformities of 2 adjacent vertebral bodies at the 
thoracolumbar
junction are of indeterminate age.

___ KNEE XR
FINDINGS: 
Patient is status post right total knee arthroplasty which 
appears in normal
alignment without hardware complications or loosening.  There is 
a trace joint
effusion.  Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized 
without acute
fracture.  Vascular calcifications are noted.  No concerning 
lytic or
sclerotic osseous abnormalities detected.
 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute fracture or dislocation.  Status post right total knee 
arthroplasty
without hardware complications.  Small joint effusion.

___ CT PELVIS WO CONTRAST
FINDINGS: 
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions.  No 
acute fracture
or dislocation.  Partially imaged lumbar spine demonstrates 
levoscoliosis. 
Moderate to severe degenerative changes are seen in the lower 
lumbar spine. 
Mild degenerative changes are seen in bilateral femoroacetabular 
joints with
subchondral sclerosis and mild joint space narrowing.  Patient 
is status post
L3-L4 laminectomies.
 
SOFT TISSUES:  A gallstone is seen in the partially imaged 
gallbladder which
appears distended.  The partially imaged right kidney 
demonstrates several
hypodense cysts as well as an intermediate density cyst arising 
from the lower
pole (03:14) measuring 8 mm.  There is large stool burden in the 
rectum and
nonspecific presacral fat stranding.  Diverticulosis of the 
colon is noted,
without evidence of diverticulitis.  Calcified and hypodense 
fibroids are
noted within a bulky uterus.  A left inguinal hernia containing 
fat is noted. 
There is diffuse soft tissue anasarca. Severe atherosclerotic 
vascular
calcifications are noted.  Coarse calcifications in the 
bilateral gluteal
regions likely represent injection granulomas.  No joint 
effusion is seen.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or dislocation.
2. Large stool burden in the rectum with nonspecific presacral 
fat stranding.
3. Colonic diverticulosis.
4. Fibroid uterus.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Partially imaged right lower pole renal cysts, one of which 
is intermediate
in density and could be further assessed with dedicated renal 
ultrasound.

___ R HIP XR
FINDINGS: 
The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.  No acute 
fracture or
dislocation is present.  Mild degenerative changes are seen 
involving the
right femoroacetabular joint with subchondral sclerosis and 
joint space
narrowing.  No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous 
abnormalities detected. 
Scattered vascular calcifications are seen.  Coarse 
heterogeneous
calcification in the imaged right pelvis is compatible with a 
calcified
fibroid uterus.  Large amount of stool is partially imaged 
within the rectum.
 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute fracture or dislocation.  No findings to suggest 
avascular necrosis. 
Mild degenerative changes of the right hip joint.

___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM:

ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular 
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is 
normal (2.1 cm; nl>1.6cm) consistent with normal right 
ventricular systolic function. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. 
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic 
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle. Normal 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic 
and mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
Severe pulmonary hypertension. No valvular vegetations seen. 

___ CXR AP
IMPRESSION: 
Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
Persistent tear of mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality may 
be due to
chronic lung disease rather than edema.  Heart size is 
top-normal.  Pleural
effusions small if any.  No pneumothorax.
 
Atherosclerotic calcification is heavy in the normal size 
thoracic aorta.
 
PA and lateral chest radiograph strongly recommended for 
evaluation of the
lower lobes and possible pneumonia on the left.
 
Healed left upper rib fractures noted.

___ MRI R HIP WO CONTRAST
FINDINGS: 
There is normal marrow signal within the right femoral head. 
There is no
evidence of avascular necrosis, fracture, stress fracture. The 
marrow signal
throughout the rest of the pelvis is within normal limits. The 
imaged
sacroiliac joints show no erosive changes.
 
Focused imaging of the right hip demonstrates a small amount of 
joint fluid.
There is moderate loss of joint space with thinning of the 
articular
cartilage.  There is a superior lateral labral tear.
 
Minimal fluid seen in the trochanteric bursa.  There is mild to 
moderate
insertional tendinopathy involving the gluteus medius tendon.  
Mild
insertional tendinopathy of the hamstrings onto the ischial 
tuberosity.

1. No significant right hip joint effusion.  Normal marrow 
signal in the
pelvis or right femur, no definite evidence for septic joint. .  
Mild
insertional tendinopathy involving the gluteus medius and 
hamstring tendons.
 
Incidental large cystic lesion with internal solid component in 
the right
hemipelvis, recommend further assessment with a transvaginal 
ultrasound to
exclude an endometrial/ovarian mass.

___ PELVIC US
FINDINGS: 
The uterus is anteverted and measures approximately 8.1 x 5.4 x 
6.0 cm and
contains fibroids. The endometrium is dilated with a large 
amount anechoic
fluid contains debris an echogenic nodule measuring 1.6 x 1.2 
cm,
corresponding to nodularity as seen on MRI. No increased 
internal vascularity
noted.
 
The ovaries are not visualized.  There is no free fluid.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Fluid-filled dilated endometrial cavity may suggest cervical 
stenosis
without features to suggest infection.
2. Redemonstrated 1.6 x 1.2 cm endometrial solid nodule as seen 
on prior MRI. 
Differential considerations favor a intrauterine fibroid, 
although endometrial
polyp is difficult to exclude.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
===============
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a past medical history
of rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone, ESRD on ___ HD,
COPD on 2L home O2, recent episode of ESBL E. Coli bacteremia
___, completed treatment with Zosyn for 14 day course) who 
presented to ___ with 3 days of atraumatic right hip pain 
concerning for septic arthritis, likely seeded by her recurrence 
of her E. coli bacteremia. She was transferred to ___, treated 
with IV antibiotics, seen by ID, orthopedics, had a R hip MRI, 
and discharged on meropenem for 6 weeks with OPAT follow up.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#ESBL E Coli bacteremia
Blood cultures positive from ___ and ED for GNRs. His 
cultures grew in recurrent ESBL E. Coli from ___, for which 
she already completed a course of zosyn x14d. TTE negative for 
vegetation. The source of the ESBL E Coli is unknown but we 
considered GI vs GU, given her history of rectal prolapse per 
her report (she had seen a colorectal surgeon at ___). 
Colorectal surgery saw her during this admission and firmly 
believed her ectropion was not an infectious source. The E Coli 
was sensitive to meropenem. ID was consulted and she was treated 
with IV meropenem for 6 week course. Her ___ blood culture was 
positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, but this was 
speciated to coag negative staph and was likely a contaminant. 

#Leukocytosis: Initially elevated to ___ iso bacteremia as well 
chronic elevation from steroid use. Downtrending on discharge to 
baseline with treatment of bacteremia as above. Discharge WBC: 
16.8. 

#Septic Joint
Initially concerning for septic arthritis vs. trochanteric 
bursitis.
Atraumatic hip pain. Joint aspirate with 22K WBCs and Hct 22,
negative culture. However she had already received two days of 
antibiotics at the time of aspiration. She was seen by ortho, 
who thought her pain was likely trochanteric bursitis. GNRs 
would also be an atypical cause of septic arthritis, but the hip 
could have been seeded during her recent bacteremia. Rheum and 
ID both agreed with the diagnosis of a likely septic joint and 
recommend wash out, which was deferred by orthopedics. An MRI R 
hip was obtained notable for small effusion with no evidence of 
a septic joint. Rheumatology was concerned that she may not 
improve with antibiotics alone given the severity of her RA, 
however, the decision was made to treat the patient 
conservatively with IV antibiotics. Patient seemed to improve 
clinically with antibiotics with improved mobility at the joint 
so a wash-out was deferred in agreeance with all consulting 
services. She had a PICC line placed on ___ for continued 
antibiotics. 

#Incidental Uterine Mass
#Cervical stenosis
Incidentally found mass seen on her MRI of her R hip. She had a 
follow up pelvic US which showed a likely fibroid vs. polyp. The 
ultrasound also revealed a fluid filled uterine cavity 
concerning for cervical stenosis. The patient was asymptomatic. 
She will need outpatient gynecology follow-up. 

#ESRD on HD 
#Hyperkalemia
Initially became fluid overloaded and hyperkalemic in the 
setting of missing HD. Transferred to the ICU for 2 days until 
stabilized with emergent HD and returned to the floor. Her 
hyperkalemia was treated with insulin/Calcium. Discharge K 5.8 
after which she received HD. On MWF HD. Access: LUE AVF. 

#Macrocytic Anemia
Most likely secondary to ESRD. MCV 101-102. Folate normal. B12
low-normal 389. Recommend serum or urine MMA as outpatient to 
assess for B12 deficiency as a low normal B12 may still be 
deficient at the tissue level.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Hypertension. Remained hypertensive to 180s, but asymptomatic.
Her home regimen was continued as below: 
On HD days: Hydral 25 BID, labetalol 300 BID
On non-HD days: Hydral 25 TID, labetalol 300 TID, amlodipine 10
On all days: Lisinopril 10
Her lisinopril was increased to 20 mg po daily in light of 
continued high blood pressures. 

#Rheumatoid arthritis 
Initially give 10 mg prednisone po daily and titrated down to 
7.5 mg as per rheumatology recs. 

#COPD on 2L home O2 
There is some concern that her respiratory disease is actually
due to ILD in the setting of her RA. Could consider PFTs as an
outpatient. She received O2 and her home nebulizers

#Hypothyroidism 
She was continued on levothyroxine 125 mcg daily. 

#Anxiety/depression 
She was continued on her home pregabalin, clonazepam, sertraline 
and trazodone. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Please ensure patient completes her 6 week course of 
antibiotics, ___, and follows up with OPAT
[] Please check blood pressure as outpatient, of note blood 
pressures elevated to the 180s and 190s systolic during her 
admission. Consider up titration of her lisinopril as needed.
[] Please check a CBC and BMP to monitor her leukocytosis to 
check for hyperkalemia
[] please check serum or urine methylmalonic acid given 
borderline low Vitamin B12 (389), which may contribute to 
patient's microcytic anemia 
[] Please consider outpatient PFTs to better assess whether her 
lung disease is due to her COPD or ILD secondary to RA, or a 
mixed picture. Also consider a sleep study to r/o OSA. 
[] Please follow-up with OBGYN for uterine mass (fibroid vs. 
polyp) as well cervical stenosis.
[] R lower pole of kidney showing renal cysts, recommend a 
dedicated renal ultrasound to evaluate nonurgently. 
[] Patient reported breaking of lower teeth during this 
admission of unclear etiology. No reported trauma. Attempted to 
obtain a panorex, but patient was unable to tolerate. Please 
consider follow-up outpatient.

The patient is a ___ year old gentleman with a history of AVR and 
aortic aneurysm repair, L CFA-axillary bypass graft ___ and R 
femoral to axillary bypass PFTE graft ___ admitted with right 
groin wound dehiscence and S. anginosus and MSSA bacteremia with 
course c/b rupture of a mycotic aneurysm at his femoral graft 
site. 

VASCULAR: Right groin wound was packed, and patient was started 
on vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl and admitted to the vascular 
surgery service. Admission blood cultures grew strep anginosus 
and wound swab was polymicrobial including MSSA and e Coli. CT 
angiogram was concerning for infection at the site of bypass 
graft anastamosis with the femoral artery. ID was consulted, who 
recommended transition to Zosyn. Pt was then pre-oped and 
consented for surgery for infected right femoral axillary 
bypass. Coumadin was stopped in preperation of surgery. He was 
on a heparin drip for his mechanical valve. 

CTA: 
  
1. Widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with 
minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the 
bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site. Although, 
no drainable 
fluid collections or abscesses are seen, this would be 
concerning for 
infection in the presence of clinical symptoms. 
  
2. Stable appearance of the ascending thoracic aortic graft and 
widely patent 
left axillary to femoral bypass graft. Normal appearance of the 
abdominal 
aorta and its major visceral branches. 
  
3. Unchanged appearance of an isodense right lower pole renal 
lesion and 
multiple indeterminate left renal lesions since the earlier 
study. These can 
be further evaluated by renal CTA protocol if this has not 
evaluated before. 

He was taken to the OR after developing several small bleeds 
from his operative site concerning for herald bleeds from a 
ruptured aneurysm. In the OR on ___ he was found to have fresh 
clotted blood at his femoral graft site with concern for a 
disrupted femoral anastomosis. He was found to have inflammatory 
changes in his retroperitoneum and a large inflammatory phlegmon 
at his rectus. The distal portion of his axillofemoral graft was 
detached and a saphenous vein graft was placed. 

___ - Exploration of right groin, control of the external iliac 
artery via a retroperitoneal exposure, excision of distal 
portion of the axillary-femoral bypass,
and vein patch repair of the femoral artery with saphenous vein 
patch.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

Due to his massive bleeding and transfusion requirements, he 
developed abdominal compartment syndrome overnight and was taken 
back to the OR on ___ for exploration of retroperitoneal space, 
washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, 
packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the 
abdominal incision which was left open. 

___ - Exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of 
retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the 
retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision 
which was left open.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

___ - Abdominal packing removal, Abdominal washout, Temporary 
abdominal closure.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

___ - Abdominal closure with mesh.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR. 

On ___ patient had decreased urine output in setting of 
increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, 
which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and 
muscle paralysis. Neo was weaned. Sedation was transitioned to 
Precedex and vent was changed to PSV, with improvement in 
alertnent. 

Patient was noted to have elevated LFTs; RUQ ultrasound showed 
no abnormalities and LFTs trended downward. Systolic blood 
pressure rose to 200s with agitation, which responded to 
Fentanyl and hydralazine. 

On ___ patient was extubated. Patient passed bedside swallow 
eval and was transition to oral nutrition. 

On ___ patient was transferred from the CVICU to the VICU.

In the VICU to floor non incidental, The rest of the Hospital 
course will by systems:

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient narcotics IV with good 
effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, 
the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. 

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored. Pt also has Mechanical 
Valve was on IV heparin with transition tocoumadin on DC

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen 
to encourage bowel movement. Pt did have trouble with nutrion, 
started on dronabinol  2.5 mg PO BID. Pt also had loose stools - 
neg C Diff x 3, d/c'ed IV flagyl per ID

GU: Foley was removed when apprpriate. Intake and output were 
closely monitored. Pt did have acute on chronic renal failure. 
On ___ patient had decreased urine output in setting of 
increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, 
which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and 
muscle paralysis

ID: ID consult, Was originally on IV vanco . PO cipro / PO 
flagyl. ID transitioned to IV Zosyn - to be on a total of 6 
weeks, then PO supression therapy for life. Name of ___ 
to be determined. The patient's temperature was closely watched 
for signs of infection. 

He waa dmitted on ___ with a wound dehiscence and fever. ___ 
blood cultures drawn ___ grew S. anginosus as well as MSSA on 
___ and ___. A wound swab of the right groin site has grown 
MSSA as well as mixed flora. A CT Torso on ___ showed ""a widely 
patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic 
site."" A TEE was performed showed ""a well-seated bi-leaflet 
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with normal leaflet motion 
and gradients. No discrete vegetations."" 

The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam for 
coverage of S. anginosus and MSSA BSI as well as a polymicrobial 
wound infection. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. 

On day of discharge, pt's BUN/creat =65/2.6, thought to be 
likely due to dehydration. IVF bolus was given with maintenance 
IVF to continue at rehab until creatinine trends down. PO fluids 
also encouraged. Lasix was discontinued and ___ should not be 
restarted until creatinine at baseline. VAC was also 
discontinued and  should continue on wet to dry BID until follow 
up. Foley was reinserted for urinary retention of approx 600 cc 
urine. Please attempt voiding trial in a day or so.

CTA chest ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
2. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. 
3. Dense calcifications in the aorta, coronary arteries, and 
cardiac valves.  
  
4. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis. 

PMIBI ___:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Reversible, medium sized, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the 
LAD territory. 
  
2. Reversible, small, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the OM 
territory. 
  
3. Transient cavity dilation, consistent with left main or 
multi-vessel 
disease. 
  
4. Apical hypokinesis with preserved systolic function. 
  
Compared with the study of ___, the LAD territory defect 
and apical wall 
motion abnormality are new. 

STRESS ___:
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes. 
Baseline systolic hypertension with an appropriate hemodynamic 
response 
to the Persantine infusion. Nuclear report sent separately. 

Coronary CT ___:
FINDINGS: 
  
Coronary arteries are coming out of conventional origin. 
  
LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY: The proximal portion and the mid 
portion of the 
left main coronary artery are patent with no appreciable 
atherosclerotic 
disease. 
  
LAD: Just at the bifurcation of left main coronary artery into 
LAD and 
circumflex, there is significant atherosclerotic disease 
represented as 
calcified and soft plaque with a significant narrowing/almost 
occluding the 
proximal portion of LAD by soft plaque. The mid and distal 
portions of the 
LAD are free of disease. 
  
LEFT CIRCUMFLEX: Extensive disease involves the entire left 
circumflex 
artery. At the proximal portion, no apparent obstruction of 
circumflex is 
noted. The patient has left dominance. 
  
RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: The right coronary artery is small, 
heavily calcified 
and potentially excluded. 
  
Extensive calcifications of the branches of LAD and circumflex 
are present. 
  
The airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi 
bilaterally. The 
pulmonary arteries are dilated as demonstrated on the recent CT 
of the chest 
consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Cardiomegaly is present 
. Diffuse 
ground-glass opacities within the lungs in conjunction with air 
trapping are 
noted. This appears similar to prior study from ___ and 
might reflect 
expiratory character of the study or mild volume overload. No 
pleural or 
pericardial effusion is noted. Left ventricular enlargement with 
prominence 
of the apical enlargement is seen. 

Cardiac Catheterization ___:
Findings
ESTIMATED blood loss: <100 cc
Hemodynamics (see above): 
Left ventriculography: mitral regurgitation; LVEF %; 
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA:  40% distal
LAD:  moderate calcification.   Mid vessel 50% with bifurcating
diagonal with diffuse disease.  Lower pole 80% stenosis 
unchanged
from ___.
LCX:  Diffuse noncritical disease.  Small OM1 origin 40%.  OM2
has proximal 70% stenosis also unchanged from ___.
RCA:  Widely patent stent in a small vessel.  Diffuse 40-50%
stenoses.

Assessment & Recommendations
1.Unchanged angiography from ___.
2.Diastolic CHF with elevated LVEDP.
3.Medical management of CAD and CHF.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH of CAD, DM and ESRD presents with complaint of 
exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort.
  
# CORONARIES:
- Pt's story of exertional symptoms and atypical chest pain 
occur with roughly the same amount of exertion, relieved by 
nitroglycerin, and never at rest
- With PMH CAD, this presentation was concerning for stable 
angina
- initially treated with medical therapy with ASA, statin, and 
agressive afterload reduction
- PMIBI results concerning for multiterritorial perfusion 
defects
- Main concern regarding the results of her PMIBI was the 
possibility of left main disease, which would require a high 
risk cath
- This has been verified with the presence of high grade 
proximal LAD and LCx disease (left main equivalent) on Coronary 
CTA
- After a risk/benefit discussion with patient and family the 
decision was made for cardiac catheterization
  - Cath results failed to reveal any significant left main 
disease, or any worsening CAD from prior study in ___
- Pt was not placed on Plavix ___ concern regarding her 
anemia/thrombocytopenia and potential fall risk at home
.  
# PUMP:  
- last echo on ___ with preserved EF, clinically appears 
euvolemic but with evidence of elevated LVEDP to 32 during cath
- communicated to the Nephrology team that pt should be dialyzed 
as aggressively as possible to optimize fluid status, as volume 
overload could contribute to her symptoms of DOE
- dc'ed home lasix as not likely to be of any benefit, pt has 
very little UOP ___ ESRD
.  
#  HTN
- currently SBP 110's-150, will control to goal <140
- Continued home meds amlodipine, clonidine and lisinopril at 
current doses, increased imdur to 60mg daily
- if further titration is needed in the outpatient setting PO 
hydralazine would be a good option
.
# Skin Lesions
- Pt initially presented with eczematous lesion on face that was 
treated symptomatically with sarna lotion with subjective 
improvement per patient
- On ___, pt found to have R hand swelling and multiple areas 
of painless skin sloughing
- Dermatology consult was obtained, placed pt on regimen of 
steroid cream for her face, bactroban for the hand lesion which 
was thought to be skin sloughing from an infiltrated IV
- RUE US negative for DVT
- skin creams were continued as an outpatient regimen
.
# UTI
- pt with complaint of dysuria on admission, previous UCx + for 
VRE on last admission which was not treated
- Initially placed on empiric linezolid while cx data brewing 
___ prior untreated VRE
- ___, Ucx with pan sensitive E coli and other G+ flora, 
continued tx with cipro to complete 10d course.  Repeat culture 
with GNR

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___, 

You were admitted to the ___ for the evaluation of your 
shortness of breath.  We performed many studies including a 
stress test to evaluate whether a blockage in your coronary 
arteries was causing your shortness of breath.  You underwent a 
cardiac catheterization that did not show any new blockage in 
your coronaries to explain your symptoms.  After we made some 
adjustments to your blood pressure regimen and took off some 
fluid at dialysis you felt better and were safe for discharge 
home.  

Please take all medications as prescribed.  Weigh yourself every 
morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Medications:
Added: Hydrocerin (Eucerin) cream, Hydrocortisone cream, 
mupirocin cream, sarna lotion, zinc soap, 
Changed: Imdur (increased to 60mg daily) and simvastatin 
(decreased to 40mg daily)
Removed: Lasix

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort. She has a past medical history of CAD, DM with CKD, Afib, and HLP. She was recently hospitalized for volume overload and underwent ultrafiltration and diuresis. On admission, her troponin level was 0.08, and a d-dimer was positive. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed significant atherosclerotic disease in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She was diagnosed with mitral regurgitation and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of unknown percentage.

The patient's medications at discharge include ASA 325 and SL nitroglycerin. She has a history of allergies to Motrin. Her physical examination was notable for a palpable pulse in the right and left carotid, femoral, popliteal, and dorsal pedal arteries.

Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness and incoordination
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endobronchial biopsy of right and left lung nodules

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with a history of
prostate CA s/p radiation, hyperlipidemia, cervical spine
disease, and longstanding tobacco use who presents with left
sided weakness and incoordination over the last 10 days. He
reports that he had ""the flu"" about 6 weeks ago with URI 
symptoms
and muscle aches. This resolved, but then about 2 weeks ago he
began to have muscle aches again that felt very similar. These
started in his left quadriceps and then spread over the next
several days to involve his bilateral quadriceps, calves, and
triceps as well. He saw his PCP ___ ___ for his annual physical
and then again on ___ due to the persistent myalgias. At that
point he had also begun to experience intermittent vertigo as
well. This was only present with movement such as turning his
head or standing up to walk and resolved completely at rest. He
describes it as a brief sensation of spinning or movement 
lasting
seconds. CK and ESR were checked due to the myalgias and were
negative. His vertigo was felt to be most likely peripheral.
Basic labs were all normal and he was advised to monitor his
symptoms. 

However over the next week his vertigo persisted, still only
brought on by movement, and he also began to notice weakness in
his left arm and leg. He initially attributed this to the muscle
aches, which ultimately resolved on the right but have still
persisted a little in his left quad and triceps. However over 
the
last week he has also noticed that it is more difficult to
control his left arm and leg. He says they feel weak but also
clumsy, and his arm ""flops around"" when he tries to use it. His
wife says he also veers toward the left when he walks, and his
left leg has ""given out"" on him a couple of times. He has fallen
twice in the last week, once when getting out of the car and 
then
again yesterday when he was trying to help his wife make up the
bed. Both times his left leg just seemed to buckle and he fell 
to
the ground, sustaining some scrapes but no significant injuries.
Last night he was playing cards with his friends, which he has
done for ___ years, and realized that he couldn't hold the cards
or shuffle with his left hand. At this point he became 
concerned,
as he says one of his other friends in the group had a stroke a
few years ago with very similar symptoms. He therefore went back
to Dr. ___ this morning, and on exam he was found to
have left sided weakness and ataxia and was sent to the ED for
further evaluation.

In addition he also reports one episode of headache last week on
___, around the time that he first noticed the left sided
weakness. He describes the headache as bifrontal pressure with 
no
other associated symptoms. This was a bit unusual for him as he
does not typically get headaches but it resolved on its own and
has not recurred. He also noticed brief blurring of vision in 
his
left eye around the same time which also lasted for about a day
and then resolved. He denies any diplopia or loss of vision. He
reports that he has chronic tingling in his left arm and hand 
due
to an ulnar nerve injury many years ago, but this has seemed a
bit more prominent lately than usual. He denies any numbness or
tingling in his face or leg. He denies any problems with his
speech.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, diplopia, 
dysarthria,
dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech. No bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills (since his flu-like illness 6 weeks ago).  No night 
sweats
or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of 
breath.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

PATHOLOGY: 
- Lung biopsies (___): ***PATHOLOGY PENDING***

STUDIES: 

- NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT (___): Findings concerning for multiple 
intracranial lesions which raises suspicion for metastatic 
disease.  Correlate with history of malignancy. MRI would be 
helpful for further evaluation. 

- CTA HEAD/NECK (___):  
1. Three distinct heterogeneously-enhancing parenchymal lesions, 
with cystic necrosis, within the superior cerebellar vermis, and 
the left frontal and parietal lobe, worrisome for metastatic 
disease. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
2. Mild effacement of the left ambient cistern. 
3. 2.7 cm soft tissue mass within the azygos lobe with an 
associated 3.2 cm necrotic precarinal lymph node which may 
represent primary bronchogenic neoplasm with metastatic 
lymphadenopathy. 
4. Patent vasculature. No aneurysm, dissection, or stenosis. 

- MRI BRAIN W/WO GAD (___): 
1. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior frontal and left 
medial 
occipital regions, which may be leptomeningeal or superficial 
cortical, 
without significant mass effect. Punctate left superior frontal 
cortical 
metastasis adjacent to the larger left frontal metastasis. 
2. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior cerebellar vermis 
and left 
cerebellar hemisphere. The dominant metastasis in the left 
cerebellar vermis effaces the left ambient cistern with 
deformation of the left inferior colliculus. It also partially 
effaces the fourth ventricle without obstructive hydrocephalus. 
3. 4 mm enhancing lesion in the superior right aspect of the 
occipital bone, corresponding to a lytic lesion with erosion of 
the outer table on the prior CT, indicating an osseous 
metastasis. 
  
COMMENT: The appearance of the intracranial and calvarial 
lesions is more suggestive of metastatic disease from the right 
apical pulmonary mass seen on the preceding CTA, than from 
prostate cancer, but tissue diagnosis is needed. 

CT ___ W CONTRAST (___):  
1. Multiple enlarged low-attenuation mediastinal lymph nodes and 
right hilar lymph node. A 1.4 cm subpleural nodule in the right 
upper lobe. Adjacent to/contiguous with the necrotic right upper 
paratracheal lymph node. Multiple pulmonary nodules identified 
measuring up to 5 mm. Findings are suspicious of pulmonary and 
nodal metastases. The mediastinal lymph nodes are amenable for 
biopsy via bronchoscopy. 
2. A 1.5 cm and 1.6 cm hypodense lesions in segment 2 and 4B 
nonspecific but suspicious for hepatic metastasis, especially 
segment 4B lesion. 
3. 3.5 cm solid lesion identified posterior to the left psoas 
muscle, 
suspicious for metastasis. This lesion is amenable for biopsy 
under CT 
guidance, if necessary. 
4. Enlarged necrotic lymph nodes at the left external iliac and 
left common iliac chain, suspicious for nodal metastases. 
5. Cholelithiasis. Small hiatal hernia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo RH M with a history of prostate CA s/p radiation, 
hyperlipidemia, cervical spine disease, and tobacco use who 
presents with left sided weakness and incoordination over the 
last 10 days. In the ED, head CT showed 3 lesions with central 
hemorrhage/necrosis and vasogenic edema in the left frontal 
lobe, left parietal lobe, and most notably in the left 
cerebellar vermis coming close to impinging on the ___ 
ventricle, with no hydrocephalus. CTA head/neck incidentally 
revealed a mass in the right upper lung with adjacent necrotic 
lymph nodes. The findings were highly concerning for metastatic 
cancer. 

# HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Neurology service for 
further workup. MRI brain confirmed presence of hemorrhagic 
metastases in the left frontal and parietal lobes and left 
cerebellar hemisphere with small amount of vasogenic edema. CT 
torso revealed multiple lesions concerning for metastatic cancer 
-- enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, 1.4cm RUL nodule and 
multiple other pulmonary nodules, 2 liver lesions, solid lesion 
posterior to the left psoas, and enlarged necrotic left iliac 
lymph nodes. Given his smoking history and distribution of the 
lesions, findings were highly suspicious for metastatic lung 
cancer. 

The next day an endobronchial biopsy of the right lung and LNs 
was obtained by Interventional Pulmonology (results pending on 
discharge). Hematology-Oncology, Neuro-Oncology, Neurosurgery 
and Radiation Oncology services consulted for workup and 
planning. Given the size of the cerebellar mass and its close 
proximity to the ___ ventricle, it was felt that patient would 
need whole brain radiation (fractionated radiotherapy to the 
area would cause too much swelling and thus hydrocephalus, and 
surgical resection would be unsafe given his age and 
comorbidities). After much debate, it was decided that he needed 
EVD placed before beginning whole brain XRT since risk for 
subsequent edema and hydrocephalus was still high. This will be 
performed one week after discharge, on ___ -- 
patient will be called beforehand with time and name of 
neurosurgeon doing the procedure. Following EVD placement, he 
will see Radiation Oncology (Dr. ___ in clinic to begin 
planning for whole-brain radiation. They anticipate beginning 
XRT one week after surgery in order to allow superficial wound 
healing. 

Patient was started on Dexamethasone 4mg qAM (with GI 
prophylaxis) in the hospital for additional for additional 
protection against vasogenic edema. He was also given oxycodone 
on discharge for left hip pain caused by metastases to the area, 
which cause him significant discomfort. 

At the time of discharge, results of the lung biopsy are still 
pending. Once they return, Heme-Onc will coordinate follow up 
and planning for systemic therapy in the appropriate clinic

finger movements on left, mildly wide based gait. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for new clumsiness and 
weakness on the left side of your body. An MRI of your brain 
showed 3 masses concerning for metastatic cancer, one of which 
was in an area called the CEREBELLUM and carries a high risk for 
causing brain cancer (HYDROCEPHALUS). A subsequent CT scan of 
your torso showed masses in your lymph nodes, lungs and liver 
also concerning for cancer. A lung biopsy was performed, results 
pending. 

The next step in your care will be to start whole brain 
radiation. Before this, you will need a ventriculo-peritoneal 
(VP) shunt. This will be done on ___. You will 
be called by the Neurosurgery apartment with the name of the 
surgeon who will perform the operation and the time of surgery. 

Approximately 3 days after shunt placement, you should attend 
your follow-up appointment with Radiation Oncology. They will 
coordination your radiation plan, as well as your follow-up 
appointments with Neuro-Oncology (___). You will be 
called by them to schedule this appointment in the next few 
days.

You are scheduled for an outpatient with Medical Oncology (Dr. 
___ on ___ to discuss the results of your lung 
biopsy, which should have returned by them. See below for more 
info. They will plan your systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or 
radiation) once the lung biopsy results have returned. 

We made the following changes to your medications: 
1. STARTED Dexamethasone (Decadron) 4mg by mouth in AM -- this 
is to treat swelling of the brain due to cancer. 
2. STARTED Famotidine 20mg twice daily -- this is to prevent 
acid reflux caused by Decadron. 
3. STARTED Oxycodone 2.5-5mg every 6 hrs as needed for pain -- 
side effects include nausea and constipation. Can take over the 
counter laxative as needed.
4. STARTED Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg every 8 hrs as needed for 
nausea -- if experienced as side effect of oxycodone.

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 64-year-old male who presented with left-sided weakness and incoordination over the last 10 days. He has a history of prostate cancer, hyperlipidemia, cervical spine disease, and longstanding tobacco use. He reports having had ""the flu"" six weeks ago, which resolved, but then began to experience muscle aches again, which spread to his bilateral quadriceps, calves, and triceps. He also noticed intermittent vertigo, which was felt to be most likely peripheral. His weakness and incoordination progressed, and he began to experience difficulty controlling his left arm and leg, which felt weak and clumsy. He has fallen twice in the last week and has noticed that his left leg has ""given out"" on him. 

The patient was found to have left-sided weakness and ataxia on examination and was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. He also reports one episode of headache last week, which resolved on its own, and brief blurring of vision in his left eye, which also resolved. 

The patient's past medical history includes hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, cervical disc herniation, and longstanding tobacco use. He has a family history of brain cancer and stroke. 

On physical examination, the patient was found to have normal vital signs, and his neurological examination revealed normal mental status, cranial nerves, and sensation, but decreased sensation in the left ulnar distribution. He had significant dysmetria on left finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin testing, and his gait was mildly wide-based.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: ___ year old man with h/o AML s/p allo cord transplant 
complicated by chronic GVHD of the joints who now presents with 
worsening joint pain.  

# GVHD with joint pain: Chronic joint pain and recent 
exacerbation likely due to a combination of GVHD and change in 
narcotics regimen (as patient decreased oxycotin dosage to qhs 
from BID). Uric acid was up to 10.7, but the distribution and 
appearance of joints are not classic for gout. There is no 
swelling, erythema, or decreased range of motion to suggest 
infectious arthritis. CRP 20.3/ESR 55 suggestive of a 
inflammatory process. Efforts were made to improve control of 
his GVHD. In the recent weeks prior to admission Mr ___ 
was switched from Tacrolimus to Cellcept for ongoing nausea and 
vomitting. Mr ___ revealed that he had stoped taking 
plaquinil prior to admission because of his ongoing nausea as 
well. Therefore his plaquinil was discontinued during this 
admission. His predisone was increased from 15mg to 20mg daily 
and he was continued on his home dose of cellcept. He was 
restarted on narcotic regimen of oxycotin 10mg BID and oxycodone 
5mg prn (which was rarely needed). On this regimen his pain and 
energy level improved. He was able to ambulate without 
assistance. He was discharged on the increased predinose dose 
and his home cellcept dose. He was also given OxyContin 10mg BID 
as well as MSIR for breakthrough pain (secondary to oxycodone 
shortage). Further titration of the medications may be necessary 
as an outpatient.
.
# AML: S/p allo cord transplant, now ___ on admission.  The 
transplant was complicated by GVHD as explained above.
.
# Hypotension: On ___ Mr ___ for hypotension 
accompanied by feeling of lightheadness. It did not occur with 
changing position. VS otherwise stable. His blood pressure  
improved with IVF. He was also briefly started on cefepime for 
fear of an underlying infection, however this was quickly stoped 
as he stabilized. The hypotension was in the setting of 
increased use of oxycodone and a one time use of MSIV. The 
hypotension was attributed to sedation from narcotics, his dose 
was decreased without further episodes of hypotension.
.
# Ingrown toenails:  The patient has a history of ___ ingrown 
toenails. He had pain bilaterally in the second toes. There was 
also a small 1 mm area of black discoloration, however 
peripheral pulses were normal, the feet were without other signs 
of ischemia. ABIs were obtained with normal vascular flow in the 
extremities.  Podiatry was consulted and removed the ___ ingrown 
toenails. There was also a small amount of pus on the right toe. 
The patient was treated with bacitracin. He was also started on 
a course of Keflex for the small infection.
.
# Constipation: Bowel regimen implemented with Colace, Senna, 
and Miralex.
.
# GERD: Mr ___ was increased to BID given his 
symptoms of GERD daily despite daily dosing. Further evaluation 
of the GERD should be considered if he continues to have 
symptoms as an outpatient.
.

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 52-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with worsening joint pain. He has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has undergone a myeloablative double cord blood transplant. He has been experiencing chronic joint pain since his transplant, which has worsened over the past two weeks. The patient has been taking oxycodone for pain control, but has recently decreased his dosage due to nausea and vomiting. He has also been experiencing fever, fatigue, and swelling in his joints.

The patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of AML, sarcoidosis, and chronic GVHD. He has undergone several treatments for his AML, including induction therapy, consolidation therapy, and relapse treatment. He has also received Rituxan for his chronic GVHD.

The patient's physical examination revealed a middle-aged, Cushingoid, overweight man with bilateral 2+ pitting edema to his knees. His joints were tender to palpation, and he had ecchymoses on his abdomen. His laboratory results showed an elevated CRP level, indicating an inflammatory process.

The patient's diagnosis is chronic GVHD with joint pain, likely due to a combination of GVHD and changes in his narcotics regimen. His treatment plan includes increasing his prednisone dosage and discontinuing his plaquinil medication. ||endoftext||"

CT Abdomen and Pelvis (IV Contrast):
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. Atelectasis within the lingula is additionally 
noted. 
An amorphous area low attenuation is identified within segment 
IVb of the 
liver. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, 
spleen, 
pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear within normal 
limits. The 
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally. A 
3-cm low- 
attenuation lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney is 
consistent with a simple cyst. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
of the infrarenal abdominal aorta is evident.   
There is thickening of the cecum and significant pericecal 
stranding of 
mesenteric fat. Surgical clips at the site of appendectomy are 
noted. No 
evidence of abscess or loculated fluid. A small amount of free 
fluid in this area, which also tracks down into the pelvis is 
seen. Although the distal ileum is not well distended with oral 
contrast, there is a suggestion of bowel wall thickening/edema 
and stranding of the surrounding mesenteric fat. No organized 
fluid collection is evident, however. There is no evidence of 
bowel obstruction as contrast has passed through to the rectum. 
There is no free air within the abdomen. Although the colon is 
not distended, there is a suggestion of diffuse colonic wall 
thickening. 
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, 
intrapelvic 
loops of small bowel are unremarkable. A Foley balloon is 
present within a 
decompressed bladder. A small amount of free fluid is evident 
within the 
pelvis. Small, bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are 
evident. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Inflammatory process appears to be centered in the ileocecal 
area at the site of recent appendectomy. No organized or 
drainable intra-abdominal fluid collection. Assessment is 
somewhat limited by lack of distal ileal distention with oral 
contrast. A small amount of free fluid and scattered subjacent 
lymph nodes are additionally evident.  
2. Equivocal diffuse colonic wall thickening. This finding 
raises the 
possibility of colitis and and infectious process such as C. 
difficile should be considered.   
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal 
akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the 
basal half of the inferior wall. There is minimal hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %). The estimated cardiac 
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w ischemia. Left pleural effusion. 
.
ECG ___: normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in 
leads III, AVF
.
PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
final blood cultures from ___ (no growth to date)
stool cultures, O&P from ___. SEPSIS:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an outside hospital with 
hypotension, on Levophed with an elevated WBC count of 22.6 on 
admission.  The source of infection was not clear on admission 
and differential included infection from recurrent abscesses at 
appendectomy site or C. Diff colitis.  Other etiology considered 
was reaction to CT contrast.  Was started on Vanocmycin, Zosyn 
and Flagyl in the MICU.  He remained hemodynamically stable and 
afebrile and Levophed was stopped on the day of transfer for 
MAP>65, SvO2 72, CVP 6 and good urine output.  CT showed 
inflammation prior appendectomy site without fluid collection.  
Surgery was consulted and did not recommend surgery.  
Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended 48 hours of IV 
antibiotics for presumed GI infection, then 3 weeks of PO 
antibiotics.  Cultures were obtained on ___ from ___ 
___ and showed no growth to date of blood or urine 
cultures.  Blood and urine cultures collected at ___ 
showed no growth to date.  C. Diff X 3 were negative.  The 
patient continued to do well and was trasnferred to the general 
medical floor on ___.  He was continued on IV antibiotics 
and then changed to PO antibiotics on ___.  He was put on 
Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID and Metronidazole 500mg PO TID and 
was discharged with 16 more days of antibiotics.  He will 
___ with his PCP ___ 1 week.  Another possible etiology for 
his symptoms that was considered was anaphylaxis from PO 
contrast from the CT scan, although this was less likely given 
that he has had PO contrast in the past without problems.  We 
recommended that he see an allergist as an outpatient to assess 
the possibility of an allergic reaction to PO contrast.
.
2. NSTEMI
The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes with a CK 
of 133, CKMB 19, Troponin T 0.29 and T-wave inversions in leads 
III and AVL.  Cardiology was called and thought this was likely 
rate-related demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia due 
to sepsis physiology.  Cardiac enzymes trended down and 
___ ECGs showed no change.  The patient's tachycardia 
improved with IV fluids and antibiotics.  He was asymptomatic 
during his admission.  He was put on telemetry and had no events 
or arrythmias.  An echocardiogram showed global reduced 
function, EF 45% and focal akinesis of basal inferior wall.  
Aspirin 325mg PO qday and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID were started 
for NSTEMI.  Cardiology did not recommend heparin or 
anti-platelet agents.  Cardiology recommended a ___ echo 
and cardiologist appointment within 4 weeks after his acute 
illness had resolved. The patient will have this scheduled with 
his primary care doctor.  He remained asymptomatic with no chest 
pain or signs of clinical heart failure.
.
3. EOSINOPHILIA
The patient's WBCs trended down from admission from 22.6 to 
11.8.  He had 23% bands on admission which resolved by 
discharge.  His eosinophil count was 0 on admission, however on 
___ he had 32% eosinophils, on ___ had 38% eosinophils, and 
on ___ had 36% eosinophils.  This corresponds to an absolute 
eosinophil count of 3680 on ___, 4294 on ___, and 4248 on 
___.  He had no signs of drug reaction, no fevers, skin rashes 
or other symptoms.  His diarrhea had improved over the course of 
admission but was still having ___ bowel movements per day.  His 
stool was checked for C. Diff and was negative X 3.  Ova and 
parasites and fecal stool cultures were pending at the time of 
discharge.  It was recommended that he see an allergist for 
discussion and testing for reaction to PO contrast from the CT 
scan.
.
4. DIARRHEA
Most likely etiology is antibiotic-associated as the patient has 
been on antibiotics off and on for the past several weeks.  His 
diarrhea was at times watery, but improved through admission and 
was described as loose stool at the time of discharge.  
Clostridium Difficile was checked X 3 and was negative.  He was 
discharged with Cipro and Flagyl for his antibiotic regimen.  He 
will ___ with his PCP with any further problems.  His 
final stool cultures are still pending at the time of discharge.
.
5. ANXIETY
The patient was anxious during his hospitalization regarding his 
medical condition and etiology of his sepsis.  He was given 
Ativan 0.5mg PRN for anxiety symptoms.  He was given Trazodone 
25mg PO qHS to help with sleep.  
.
6. PROPHYLAXIS
Mr. ___ was given SC Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  He was 
able to tolerate a regular diet on ___.  
.
His symptoms improved and he was discharged with close PCP 
___ and instructions to ___ with cardiology as 
arranged by his PCP.  He was also recommended to see an 
allergist on discharge for ___ of this episode as a 
potential reaction to PO contrast from the CT scan.

with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Duodenum: Normal 
duodenum. 

CXR ___:
In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette 
remains within normal limits and there is no vascular 
congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. 
Increased prominence of the right hilum most likely reflects 
obliquity of the patient.

ECHO w/ bubble study ___:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. A few very 
late microbubbles are seen in the left heart after intravenous 
injection c/w normal transpulmonic passage. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF >70%). The estimated cardiac index is 
high (>4.0L/min/m2). The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There is no valvular 
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely 
related to high cardiac output. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and excellent global biventricular systolic function. 
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No definite 
premature passage of microbubbles.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
left ventricular function is more dynamic and the estimated PA 
systolic pressure is now higher.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with PSC complicated by 
___ Class B cirrhosis decompensated with ascites, 
hepatic encephalopathy, and varices who was transferred from 
___ with fevers and hematemesis. Now s/p EGD with 
banding. Patient has remained HD stable without further episodes 
of bleeding. 

# Hematemesis: 
Patient with hematemesis in setting of aggressive vomiting 
concerning for ___ tear versus bleeding of known grade 
II esophageal varices. She underwent EGD demonstrating 2 cords 
of grade II varices that were non-bleeding, but with high-risk 
stigmata (red ___ sign) on one cord. 2 bands were successfully 
placed. Patient remained HD stable with Hg approximately at her 
baseline. She received octreotide x72h, IV PPI, and CFTX for SBP 
ppx. No further hematemesis during her hospitalization. Never 
with any blood per rectum.  She will require carafate 1g QID x 
14 days (last day ___. and repeat EGD in ___ weeks. 

#Fever: 
Febrile to 100.5 on admission. No clear infectious source. CXR 
and urine culture negative with no growth to date on blood 
cultures. In the ICU, the patient was started on treatment doses 
of ceftriaxone, although no tappable ascites pocket was present 
for diagnostic analysis of peritoneal fluid. Given new oxygen 
requirement, some concern that patient may have aspirated during 
EGD. Of note, patient was recently admitted from ___ to ___ with 
fevers and RUQ pain. Antibiotics were not given. She had an 
extensive work up for FUO at that time, notable for elevated 
ESR/CRP, but no precise etiology was determined. Patient 
remained afebrile throughout the rest of her admission and 
received four days of CFTX as ppx for SBP in setting of UGIB. 

#Hypoxemia: 
Patient noted to be intermittently hypoxemic, reportedly worse 
with vasalva. However, no orthodeoxia or platypnea to suggest 
HPS. ECHO bubble study  without evidence of intrapulmonary or 
intracardiac shunt or other concerning cardiac pathology. 
Patient with crackles at bases on lung exam. Thus, hypoxia 
likely due to atelectasis. Her oxygenation improved 
significantly and she was saturated in the high ___ prior to 
discharge without any further episodes of hypoxia. 

# Decompensated Cirrhosis:
___ Class B cirrhosis secondary to PSC decompensated 
with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and varices s/p banding on 
___. Continue hydroxyzine, rifaximin, and lactulose. Continued 
home diuretics. 

# Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis:
Continued Cholestyramine 4 gm PO DAILY  and Ursodiol 300 mg PO 
TID. 

#Hypothyroidism:
Continued home levothyroxine.

ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with a recent admission 
___ ___ for multifocal pneumonia complicated by chronic 
respiratory failure further complicated recurrent PNA x2 at 
rehab s/p trach/PEG, decannulated on ___. She presented for 
this admission with 2 days of dyspnea and productive cough, and 
was found to be hypoxemic requiring high-flow oxygen. CXR showed 
possible pneumonia and completed course of antibiotics 
(Vanc/ceftazidime, Day 1: ___. Her respiratory failure was 
thought to be secondary to recurrent aspiration related to her 
neuromuscular disease. She was given hypertonic saline nebs, 
guaiafenesin, Duonebs, pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve. She 
required intubation, and was unable to be weaned off the 
ventilator. After numerous goals of care discussions with the 
ICU team, her outpatient pulmonologist, palliative care, and her 
family, decision was made to undergo trach/PEG on ___. She 
tolerated this well, and was able to be weaned off the 
ventilator by ___, when she was transferred to floor. Cuff 
pressures were high, but patient had been tolerating this well. 
She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team

She has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has allergies to penicillins and oxybutynin. The patient's chief complaint was hypoxia, dyspnea, productive cough, and congestion, which she experienced for the past two days. She was previously intubated and had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was referred to the emergency department for stoma closure and was found to have tachypnea, rhonchorous lungs, and a stoma site. The patient was given various medications, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and cefepime. She was also given oxygen therapy and had a flutter valve inserted. The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, and normal abdominal examination. The patient's laboratory results showed anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Imaging studies revealed extensive atelectasis in the lower lungs, which could not exclude a superimposed pneumonia. The patient was discharged with a tracheostomy mask and speaking valve, and was advised to use a flutter valve and oxygen therapy. ||endoftext||"

Relevant Imaging:
------------------
TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrial volume index 
is mildly increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 60 %). There 
is a calcified subvalvular undulating mass on the aortomitral 
continuum. There maybe also a smaller mass opposite on the 
anteroseptal base. This could be a subdiaphragmatic ridge 
without impedence to blood flow since the peak flow across the 
aortic valve is not elevated. In proper clinical context 
endocarditis (fever, bacteremia) is in the differential (clip 2, 
20). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular regional/global systolic 
function. Subaortic mass, which may be simple atypical 
calcification, a non-obstructing myocardial ridge, or in proper 
clinical context endocarditis.

Please see OMR for cardiac catheterization report.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with CAD with prior MI ___ ago) with POBA to unknown 
vessel  
presents with 3 days of persistent chest tightness found to have 
posterior STEMI with occlusion of distal circumflex  

# Posterior Acute MI: Given that she presented with a STEMI, she 
went to the cath lab and is now s/p DES to culprit distal 
circumflux thrombotic occlusion. She was also noted to have an 
RCA with diffuse irregularities with mid disease of 70%. This 
was not intervened on. Pt with some mild chest pain post-cath 
but EKG reassuring, including posterior leads, which essentially 
ruled out stent thrombosis acutely. Tirofiban gtt continued 2hrs 
post cath. Initially on ticagrelor, transitioned to plavix 
because of the need for coumadin in context of APLS. Initially 
held metop given HR in 40 to low ___. TTE showed Normal 
biventricular regional/global systolic function. Cardiac 
medications were optimized to include Atorvastain 80 daily, 
Metoprolol (for residual RCA disease), restarted home ACEI and 
losartan (although in the outpatient setting, may consider 
either ACEI or ___. She continued on aspirin and plavix as 
above. In the setting of substantial anticoagulation, she 
developed several small hematomas throughout her arms and inner 
thighs; her CBC remained stable, as did her hemodynamics and she 
did not have evidence of internal bleeding. She remained stable 
on regimen of ASA, plavix, coumadin and was discharged without 
progression or worsening of hematomas. She was discharged with 
close cardiology follow-up.   

# HTN: on ACEI and ___ possibly in part from CKD but should 
likely be streamlined to ACEI only. SBPs  initially soft in 
90-100s in setting of acute MI; restarted lisinopril and ___ as 
above; discontinued spironolactone.

# OSA: continued home CPAP while in house.  

# Antiphospholipid syndrome on coumadin: INR 1.6 on admission; 
restarted home warfarin, bridged with lovenox and trended INR.   


# CKD: likely early stage with proteinuria. Cr WNL. On ACEI and 
___ per above.  
Trended Creatinine, which was 0.9 on discharge.   

# Tobacco use: nicotine patch while in house; smoking cessation 
counseling  

# Anxiety: continued home paxil and PRN ativan  

# Fibromyalgia: continued home gabapentin.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***
- discharged on losartan, she is also on lisinopril and should 
have lab chemistries checked on ___ (can consider 
choosing either lisinopril or losartan as an outpatient going 
forward).
- discontinued her home aldactone
- plavix loaded in house, she should take 75mg PO daily until 
told to discontinue by her cardiologist. 
- continue coumadin; INR therapeutic
- If chest pain recurs then repeat angio with FFR of the RCA 
lesion recommended

T and L spine was performed at night. Subarachnoid blood was 
seen in the spinal canal, but it was not felt to be impinging on 
the cord.  On ___ he was extubated, and neurology was 
consulted due to concern for lower extremity weakness.  
Recommendations by neurology were to continue dilantin and to 
start manitol to reduce ICP.  On ___, he was found to be A&O 
x1 only and a repeat head CT showed no significant change. On 
___ patient was taken to the OR for IVC and PEG tube 
placement which was performed without complication however 
postoperative the patient developed anisocoria with dilation of 
the right pupil which resolved spontaneously. Another repeat 
head CT was negative. TF were also started on ___ and were 
advanced to goal on ___. Patient was extubated on ___ 
and the mannitol was discontinued. Was transfered to the floor 
on ___ and screening for rehab was undertaken. Patient had 
physical therapy work with him allowing him to be able to go 
from the bed to the chair. On ___ the neurology team felt as 
though his reflexes were decreased in his right leg and an MRI 
was done which showed no acute processes. Per neurology, his 
dilantin may be weaned at rehab.  Patient will need to schedule 
an appointment with neurology to be followed as an outpatient. 
On ___ patient was deemed stable for discharge. Upon 
discharge patient was tolerated tube feeds at goal, was able to 
tolerate being transferred from the bed to chair, continued to 
have decreased movement in his lower extremities and had no 
other acute surgical issues. He is oriented x1 when awake.  He 
is incontinent of bladder and bowels, and requires a diaper.  On
