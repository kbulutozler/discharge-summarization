Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, he underwent living donor renal transplant with 6 
___ double J ureteral stent. Of note the venous anastomosis 
was redone intra op. The kidney was making urine. Surgeon was 
Dr. ___. Please refer to operative note further details. 
He received induction immunosuppression which consisted of ATG, 
Cellcept and Solu-Medrol. Prograf was started. 

Postop overnight, urine output decreased to 35 and SBP was in 
low ___. Normal saline boluses were given without much change. 
5% albumin was then given with gradual increase in urine output 
and SBP to low 100s. He received a 2nd dose of ATG. Prograf was 
held as this was suspected of decreasing urine output. Incision 
was intact with scant serosanguinous drainage. Abdomen was 
non-distended. He experienced a little bit of nausea and was 
given Zofran. Urine output gradually increased to 150ml/hr. He 
continued to receive ___ NS cc/cc urine output replacements. 

On postop day 2, urine output continued to average 210 to 100 
cc. IV fluid replacements were decreased to a maintenance rate D 
___ at 100cc. Vital signs were stable. A 3rd dose of ATG 
(125mg each dose) was administered and Prograf was started at 
2mg bid.  Diet was advanced to regular, however, the patient was 
reluctant to advance given h/o Crohn's and anticipation of 
multiple BMs with regular food. By postop day 5, he was taking 
solid food but c/o multiple loose stools. Imodium 2mg daily was 
started with decrease in stool output. On postop day 6, urine 
output was ~ 2 liter per day. Creatinine was down to 1.9. 
Incision was intact and without drainage. He was taking 
Oxycodone for pain with good relief and was ambulating

CT Abdomen and Pelvis (IV Contrast):
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. Atelectasis within the lingula is additionally 
noted. 
An amorphous area low attenuation is identified within segment 
IVb of the 
liver. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, 
spleen, 
pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear within normal 
limits. The 
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally. A 
3-cm low- 
attenuation lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney is 
consistent with a simple cyst. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
of the infrarenal abdominal aorta is evident.   
There is thickening of the cecum and significant pericecal 
stranding of 
mesenteric fat. Surgical clips at the site of appendectomy are 
noted. No 
evidence of abscess or loculated fluid. A small amount of free 
fluid in this area, which also tracks down into the pelvis is 
seen. Although the distal ileum is not well distended with oral 
contrast, there is a suggestion of bowel wall thickening/edema 
and stranding of the surrounding mesenteric fat. No organized 
fluid collection is evident, however. There is no evidence of 
bowel obstruction as contrast has passed through to the rectum. 
There is no free air within the abdomen. Although the colon is 
not distended, there is a suggestion of diffuse colonic wall 
thickening. 
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, 
intrapelvic 
loops of small bowel are unremarkable. A Foley balloon is 
present within a 
decompressed bladder. A small amount of free fluid is evident 
within the 
pelvis. Small, bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are 
evident. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Inflammatory process appears to be centered in the ileocecal 
area at the site of recent appendectomy. No organized or 
drainable intra-abdominal fluid collection. Assessment is 
somewhat limited by lack of distal ileal distention with oral 
contrast. A small amount of free fluid and scattered subjacent 
lymph nodes are additionally evident.  
2. Equivocal diffuse colonic wall thickening. This finding 
raises the 
possibility of colitis and and infectious process such as C. 
difficile should be considered.   
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal 
akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the 
basal half of the inferior wall. There is minimal hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %). The estimated cardiac 
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w ischemia. Left pleural effusion. 
.
ECG ___: normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in 
leads III, AVF
.
PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
final blood cultures from ___ (no growth to date)
stool cultures, O&P from ___. SEPSIS:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an outside hospital with 
hypotension, on Levophed with an elevated WBC count of 22.6 on 
admission.  The source of infection was not clear on admission 
and differential included infection from recurrent abscesses at 
appendectomy site or C. Diff colitis.  Other etiology considered 
was reaction to CT contrast.  Was started on Vanocmycin, Zosyn 
and Flagyl in the MICU.  He remained hemodynamically stable and 
afebrile and Levophed was stopped on the day of transfer for 
MAP>65, SvO2 72, CVP 6 and good urine output.  CT showed 
inflammation prior appendectomy site without fluid collection.  
Surgery was consulted and did not recommend surgery.  
Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended 48 hours of IV 
antibiotics for presumed GI infection, then 3 weeks of PO 
antibiotics.  Cultures were obtained on ___ from ___ 
___ and showed no growth to date of blood or urine 
cultures.  Blood and urine cultures collected at ___ 
showed no growth to date.  C. Diff X 3 were negative.  The 
patient continued to do well and was trasnferred to the general 
medical floor on ___.  He was continued on IV antibiotics 
and then changed to PO antibiotics on ___.  He was put on 
Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID and Metronidazole 500mg PO TID and 
was discharged with 16 more days of antibiotics.  He will 
___ with his PCP ___ 1 week.  Another possible etiology for 
his symptoms that was considered was anaphylaxis from PO 
contrast from the CT scan, although this was less likely given 
that he has had PO contrast in the past without problems.  We 
recommended that he see an allergist as an outpatient to assess 
the possibility of an allergic reaction to PO contrast.
.
2. NSTEMI
The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes with a CK 
of 133, CKMB 19, Troponin T 0.29 and T-wave inversions in leads 
III and AVL.  Cardiology was called and thought this was likely 
rate-related demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia due 
to sepsis physiology.  Cardiac enzymes trended down and 
___ ECGs showed no change.  The patient's tachycardia 
improved with IV fluids and antibiotics.  He was asymptomatic 
during his admission.  He was put on telemetry and had no events 
or arrythmias.  An echocardiogram showed global reduced 
function, EF 45% and focal akinesis of basal inferior wall.  
Aspirin 325mg PO qday and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID were started 
for NSTEMI.  Cardiology did not recommend heparin or 
anti-platelet agents.  Cardiology recommended a ___ echo 
and cardiologist appointment within 4 weeks after his acute 
illness had resolved. The patient will have this scheduled with 
his primary care doctor.  He remained asymptomatic with no chest 
pain or signs of clinical heart failure.
.
3. EOSINOPHILIA
The patient's WBCs trended down from admission from 22.6 to 
11.8.  He had 23% bands on admission which resolved by

who presents with cough and shortness of breath
.  
#  Cough- Patient was recently admitted with similar symptoms at 
___ and was discharged with a course of augmentin and 
doxycycline for CAP, which she completed.  However, prior to 
admission, she developed cough associated with shortness of 
breath so she presented to ___.   In the ED, she was febrile 
with possible early pneumonia on CXR, so she received a dose of 
ceftriaxone.  Given that her WBC was normal, and cough was 
non-productive, the patient was not initially treated for HCAP.  
In addition, she has presented like this in the past and was 
treated for a COPD exacerbation.  On admission, she was started 
on azithromycin, prednisone 60mg daily and nebulizers.  Her 
symptoms improved and oxygen requirement was decreasing.  
However, she developed a fever on ___ so she was started on 
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, given recent hospital 
discharge.  She was weaned off oxygen and worked well with 
physical therapy.  Urine legionella was negative.  Blood and 
urine cultures were negative.  Sputum culture was contaminated 
with normal respiratory flora.  The patient completed an 8 day 
course of antibiotics- vancomycin 1gm q48hours, Cefepime 1g q24 
hours via ___ line.  She is being discharged on a prednisone 
taper starting at 30mg daily.  On discharge, cough, shortness of 
breath and oxygen requirement had resolved.  She was able to 
ambulate with no shortness of breath.  The patient was afebrile 
from ___ until discharge, had a normal WBC count and looked 
well.  
.  
#  Fever- Likely secondary to pneumonia.  She lacked other 
symptoms of influenza (myalgias, etc).  Patient's cultures were 
negative.  UA was negative for UTI.  
.
#  COPD- Patient improved with azithromycin, nebulizers and 
steroids.  She was weaned off oxygen and is being discharged on 
a prednisone taper, starting at 30mg daily for 14 additional 
days of therapy
.  
#  Atrial fibrillation- Continued home amiodarone and 
metoprolol.  Heart rate was regular and was well-controlled.  
Her INR trended up to 4.3 so she was cut down from 2mg 3x/week 
to 0.5 or 1.0mg daily (pending INR) given that she is on 
antibiotics and amiodarone.  As mentioned, her INR peaked at 4.3 
but then trended down.  We resumed her at 2mg daily on ___ 
when INR was 1.7.  Subsequent trend was 1.7 -> 1.5 -> 1.6.  She 
received 2mg of coumadin on ___.  We have 
instructed her to resume her prior regimen on discharge meaning 
she will take 2mg on ___ and 1mg on ___.  We also asked the 
patient to have an INR check on ___ and to please fax the 
results to her PCP for instruction on management of coumadin 
dosing.  
.  
#  Diastolic CHF- The patient has a known history of chronic 
diastolic heart failure.  On admission, there were no signs of 
fluid overload on exam.  Her oxygen requirement was attributed 
to pneumonia and COPD exerbation.  Given her elevated creatinine 
on admission, her lasix and lisinopril were initially held.  Her 
creatinine improved so we resumed her lisinopril at 20mg daily.  
By discharge, we resumed home dose of lisinopril.  Once 
creatinine stabilized, home dose of lasix was resumed and 
patient's creatinine remained stable.  She was discharged on 
home dose of lasix 20mg daily and has ___ with Dr. ___ 
on ___.
.
#  CAD- The patient did not present with chest pain.  Her EKGs 
were consistent with prior.  She was continued on her home 
statin and beta-blocker.  
.
#  Hypertension- As mentioned above, her lisinopril was 
initially held given ___ but was resumed at home dose by 
discharge.  She was continued on the remainder of her home 
medications- imdur 30mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg daily.  BP's were remained stable. 
.
#  Numbness- On the last day of admission, patient revealed to 
us that she had been experiencing numbness in her fingertips 
(all of them).  Exam did not demonstrate any sensory or motor 
deficit as patient has ___ strength in all 4 extremities with 
intact sensation bilaterally.  She is not a diabetic.  Other 
possible etiologies include b12 deficiency, radiculopathy, or 
vasculitis.  Given that her symptoms are in both hands with only 
the DIP joint affected, a cervical radiculopathy is unlikely.  
She has no other systemic symptoms suggestive of vasculitis 
(skin changes, fever, chills) and her labwork is benign.  No 
indication for imaging as remainder of neurological exam is 
intact, including gait.  This also could be due to a medication 
as she received IV antibiotics.  B12 level checked and pending 
at the time of discharge, but, given description of symptoms, 
will likely not be the etiology behind this numbness.  We ask 
that the patient's PCP ___ on this issue when she sees the 
patient on ___.
.

Output:","The patient is a 91-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of cough and fever. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. She was previously admitted to the hospital with a similar condition and was discharged with a course of antibiotics, which she completed. However, her symptoms persisted, and she presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath. On admission, she was febrile with possible early pneumonia on chest X-ray, and she received a dose of ceftriaxone. Her white blood cell count was normal, and her cough was non-productive, so she was not initially treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was started on azithromycin, prednisone, and nebulizers, and her symptoms improved."

Blood Cultures routine and mycolytic NGTD at time of D/C

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended ensure supplementation, 
but pt. did not like ensure and made this clear to nutrition, 
ensure was seen unopened on pt.s tray every morning.
.
#Diarrhea: Likely ___ OI, differential is quite wide: crypto, 
giardia, ___, CMV, C. diff. All previous wkup 
was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with a recent admission 
___ ___ for multifocal pneumonia complicated by chronic 
respiratory failure further complicated recurrent PNA x2 at 
rehab s/p trach/PEG, decannulated on ___. She presented for 
this admission with 2 days of dyspnea and productive cough, and 
was found to be hypoxemic requiring high-flow oxygen. CXR showed 
possible pneumonia and completed course of antibiotics 
(Vanc/ceftazidime, Day 1: ___. Her respiratory failure was 
thought to be secondary to recurrent aspiration related to her 
neuromuscular disease. She was given hypertonic saline nebs, 
guaiafenesin, Duonebs, pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve. She 
required intubation, and was unable to be weaned off the 
ventilator. After numerous goals of care discussions with the 
ICU team, her outpatient pulmonologist, palliative care, and her 
family, decision was made to undergo trach/PEG on ___. She 
tolerated this well, and was able to be weaned off the 
ventilator by ___, when she was transferred to floor. Cuff 
pressures were high, but patient had been tolerating this well. 
She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES
-- NEW: senna PRN and Colace PRN constipation
-- HELD: loperamide (as noted above, consider low dose trial if 
she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has allergies to penicillins and oxybutynin. The patient's chief complaint was hypoxia, dyspnea, productive cough, and congestion, which she experienced for the past two days. She was previously intubated and had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was referred to the emergency department for stoma closure and was found to have tachypnea, rhonchorous lungs, and a stoma site. The patient was given various medications, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and cefepime. She was also given oxygen therapy and had a flutter valve inserted. The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, and normal abdominal examination. The patient's laboratory results showed anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Imaging studies revealed extensive atelectasis in the lower lungs, which could not exclude a superimposed pneumonia. The patient was discharged with a tracheostomy mask and speaking valve, and was advised to use a flutter valve and oxygen therapy."

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who initially presented 
with severe abdominal pain. At that time, no obvious findings on 
CT scan and no obvious leak was appreciated. Given her pain and 
significant CT findings, it was decided that she would benefit 
from a diagnostic laparoscopy. At that time, I was concerned 
that she may actually have a gastric perforation and may have a 
gallbladder issue that could potentially be addressed 
laparoscopically. Thus, we decided to start the case 
laparoscopically with potential conversion to an open procedure 
if a significant
lesion in the stomach was appreciated. The risks and benefits of 
the procedure were described in detail to the patient. Despite 
these risks, she chose to proceed with surgery. She was found to 
have a gastric perforation and therefore converted to 
exploratory laparotomy with ___ patch and placement of a 
Pravena vac. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a IV dialudid 
PCA and then transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone 
once tolerating a diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression and nasojejunal 
tube in place for feeding.  On POD2 tube feeding were started 
through the doboff. On POD3 the NGT was accidently  removed by 
the patient when sneezing. She was kept NPO (except tube feeds). 
On POD5 she underwent upper GI leak test that was unclear and 
therefore was repeated on POD7 and negative for leak. Doboff was 
removed and she was given a regular diet with good tolerability. 
H.Pylori result was positive and therefore she was started on 
quadruple therapy once tolerating a diet. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. H.Pylori quadrupal therapy 
started and prescribed 2 week course. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital because you had abdominal 
pain. You had a CT scan which showed that you had a perforation 
in your stomach where it connects to your small intestine. It 
was found to be caused by an infection (H.pylori), for which you 
have been started on medication and will finish after discharge. 
You underwent surgery to get your perforation fixed. You have 
tolerated a regular diet, had a return of bowel function, and 
your pain has been well-controlled. Thus, you are now ready to 
be discharged home to continue your recovery. Please follow the 
discharge instructions below:

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest 
radiographs: 
  
Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces. No 
evidence of 
pneumonia or CHF. 
.
___ Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.   
A patent foramen ovale is present with right to left shunting of 
agitated saline contrast during Valsalva.  
.
___ Lower Extremity doppler ultrasound
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in right or left lower 
extremity.
.
___ Cardiac Catheterisation
Change for 6 ___ XB3 guide.  The initial plan was to pass the
wire as the primary reperfusion device.  A Pilot 50 Wire was
passed in a prolapsed fashion but this did not restore flow. 
Given that the patient was pain free and the small territory at
risk, it was decided to avoid further attempts at recanalization
(with balloon angioplasty) given risk of dissection, 
perforation.
The patient had intermittent chest pain at the end of the
procedure and was started on IV TNG and administered opiates 
with
resolution of chest pain.  He left the laboratory in stable
condition.
.
___ Foot XRay
Three views show the bony structures and joint spaces to be
essentially within normal limits. No dorsal swelling or evidence 
of erosion
is appreciated. No calcaneal spurs.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M w/ PMH of prostate CA, HTN, presenting with distal 
apical NSTEMI.
.
# APICAL LAD STEMI:  Distal LAD thrombosis with distal apical 
infarct, s/p unsuccessful recanalisation during cardiac 
catheterisation.  No other evidence of coronoary atherosclerosis 
was found. Echocardiogram whowed preserved EF and no ventricular 
wall motion abnormalities. However, he was noted to have a 
patent formane ovale.  Given absence of atherosclerotic disease, 
PFO and known CA prostate, thromboembolic event from a possible 
proximal DVT remains a possible etiology for his STEMI.  Cardiac 
enzymes peaked ___ and trended down prior to discharge. He 
was treated with a heparin drip for 2 days after the procedure, 
as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol.  He was started on 
lisinopril and atorvastatin, but these were held in the setting 
of acute kidney injury.  He will need to continue aspirin 
lifelong and clopidogrel for at least one year given his 
prothrombotic state.  Atorvastation was restarted at the time of 
discharge.
.  
# s/p CATH: unsuccessful attempt at wire recanalisation of 
distal LAD.
.
# THROMBOEMBOLISM: Cardiac cath shows no evidence of coronary 
atherosclerosis.  MI site is unusual and patient has PFO, 
history of prostate cancer, prothrombotic state. LENIs were 
negative, but did not include an evaluation of the iliac 
arteries.  He will continue aspirin and plavix for 
anticoagulation following discharge.  
.
# Fever: Etiology unclear. UA, CXR clear.  Urine cultures and 
blood cultures pending.  However, timing of fever suggests 
possible link with gout flare.  Other etiologies include: 
infection, post-MI, thromboembolism/PE, B-symptoms from cancer. 
His fever curve trended down spontaneously prior to discharge.
.
# Thigh pain - bilateral. Could be from strenous workout pt 
reports. CKs coming down but CK so out of proportion elevated 
compared to MB. We just started statin which can cause myopathy 
but states thigh pain since presentation. Pt without significant 
CAD that we know of.  We held his statin, but restarted it at 
the time of discharge.
.
# ___: Cr of 1.4 on ___ up from baseline of 1.0.  Could be 
secondary to high 
CK. Uric acid was 6.6, urinalysis was clear.  We gave him a 
small fluid bolus. 
.
# Right ankle pain - Most likely gout flair. pt with history of 
gout. A foot Xray was performed which showed no pathology.  His 
pain was controlled with percocet and colchicine.   
.  
# HTN: BP was high on presentation and he was initially on a 
nitro drip, but this was rapidly weaned and he was treated with 
metoprolol instead.  He was also started on lisinopril, but this 
was held given ___. He will need reevaluation
.
# Cardiac Risk factors: patient has hypertension.
Lipid panel was unremarkable.  HbA1C was pending at the time of 
discharge.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ACE inhibitor was held due to creatinine 
elevation.
Please reassess hypertension and creatinine as an outpatient and 
consider restarting an ACE inhibitor if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted with a heart 
attack. We performed a cardiac catheterization which showed a 
small blockage in the blood supply to the apex of your heart, 
but no other abnormalities in the blood flow to your heart.  We 
attempted to open this blockage, but were unable to do so and 
did not attempy further since the reduction of heart function 
was very small.  An echocardiogram was performed and this 
confirmed that your heart was beating normally.  The 
echocardiogram also showed that you have an open flap in your 
heart forming an abnormal connection between the right and left 
sides of your heart (a patent foramen ovale).  This kind of flap 
is found in over 10% of people.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
-STARTED Aspirin
-STARTED Clopidogrel
-STARTED Metoprolol
-STARTED Atorvastatin
-STARTED Oxycodone and Colchicine for pain
-STOPPED your home benzapril
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has a history of prostate cancer, treated with radiation therapy, and no other significant past medical history. He is allergic to Gadolinium-containing agents. 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. An attempt was made to open the lesion, but it was not successful, and the patient was treated medically to avoid a potential procedural complication. 

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and he was prescribed medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. His physical examination was normal, with no signs of cardiac failure or respiratory distress. 

Laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage, but his kidney and liver function tests were normal. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, V4-6, consistent with a STEMI. 

The patient's chest X-ray and echocardiogram showed normal heart and lung structures, with no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure."

Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ with a history of MI (___), CHF (EF 55-60% ___, GI bleed 
s/p ileostomy c/b bowel obstructions, CKD who was transferred to 
___ from OSH for L sided pneumonia and pleural effusion, 
admitted to MICU for medical management of left pleural 
effusion, hypotension (low at baseline), ___ on CKD, and 
electrolyte derangement. 
 
# L Pleural Effusion - Etiology was considered in setting of 
pneumonia (leukocytosis with left shift, cough, though afebrile) 
vs. malignancy vs. CHF exacerbation. Pleural fluid studies were 
consistent with exudative effusion (elevated LDH, fluid/serum 
protein .46), making infectious etiology most likely. Patient 
initially received CTX/Azithro at OSH. Given GI symptoms in 
setting of slight hyponatremia, we sent Legionella antigen, 
which were negative. In the MICU we continued CTX and 
Azithromycin. CT chest showed loculated non hemorrhagic 
effusions. No evidence of occult malignancy. Pleural fluid was 
sent for cytology which was negative. 

# Shock - Patient was initially hypotensive to SBPs ___. 
Distributive is most likely in setting of pulmonary infection. 
Lactate was normal. Pressures become stable with SBPs ___ 
s/p Albumin 25g IV in the ED. Cardiogenic etiology is less 
likely given normal TTE in ___. We continued to treat infection 
as described above.   
 
# Congestive Heart Failure - EF 55-60% on TTE in ___. Patient 
has been taking Lasix 40mg PO TID at home. BNP 28329 (patient 
does have CKD, 797 in ___. She was volume overloaded on exam 
(marked JVD and acute onset ___. Possibly exacerbated in the 
setting of paroxysmal afib. Diuresis was held due to hypotension 
in the MICU; however, on the floor she was digressed with 40 mg 
IV lasix for a total of 9L net negative for LOS. Her lasix was 
switched to 30 mg of Torsemide on discharge for better 
absorption. 

#Pre renal ___: On admission Creatinine elevated to 2.5. On 
___ it was 1.03, though elevated to 3.3 in ___. Likely 
cardiorenal physiology in setting of CHF and RAS (BUN/Cr 30). 
C/b hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and ACD. She 
was diuresed and her Cr improved to normal with discharge of 
0.9. She did have persistently low bicarb that improved with 
supplementation. 

# Atrial fibrillation - CHA2DS2-VASc 5 - Patient managed on 
nadolol at home. She had been started on Eliquis ___, but 
discontinued due to GIB. Patient reports increased palpitations 
over the past several days, no dizziness/lightheadedness. 
Metoprolol tartrate 6.25 IV q6h was started in the ICU and her 
metoprolol was switched to PO and uptitrated for better rate 
control. Free T4 and T3 were WNL. She was discharged on 150 XL 
of metoprolol. 
  
#Severe Malnutrition - Pt weighs 99 lbs BMI 13. Based on her 
height, ideal weight is 160 lbs. Chronically underweight and no 
evidence of underlying psychiatric illness and felt to be ___ to 
ABD pain and hyperthyroidism She's had multiple bowel surgeries 
and malabsorption is possible and fecal fat studies are pending 
at time of discharge. Celiac's ruled out. Vitamin D 27 and she 
was started on 1/weekly supplementation w/50k. B12/Folate WNL. 
She should continue with Carnation or Ensure shakes TID. 

 # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis - Pure AG metabolic acidosis 
most likely due to uremia. Another possible cause was increased 
acetaminophen ingestion in setting of pain (oxoproline). She was 
not compensating appropriately (pCO2 should be ___, likely 
___ hypoventilation in setting of marked effusion and breathing 
limited by pain (thus also some component of respiratory 
acidosis). Patient received bicarbonate in the ED. Acidosis 
began to improve with improvement in her shock state.  

 # Hyperkalemia - Likely in setting of CKD, exacerbated by 
acidosis. Patient was given Insulin/Dextrose and Calcium 
Gluconate in ED for K of 5.9. Patient received an EKG without 
peaked T waves. Her potassium began to trend toward normal.   

 # Hyperphosphatemia - Chronic issue in setting of CKD, patient 
also has hypocalcemia.  

 # Hypocalcemia - Corrected Ca 7.6. Secondary PTH likely given 
CKD. In setting of hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia and worsening renal 
function. 
 
 # Hyperthyroidism - Patient reportedly had thyroid US within 
last 6mo. R>L thyroid enlargement, which she says has been 
increasing since US.  Patient was continued on her home 
methimazole of 20 mg. 
 
 # Anemia - Patient has known CKD. There may be some component 
of nutritional deficiency, poor PO intake, s/p ileostomy. 
Patient did not require transfusion in the unit or on the 
medicine floor.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came to us with shortness of breath and we found that you 
likely had a pneumonia and a loculated pleural effusion. Our 
Thoracic surgeons drained the fluid and added a chest tube which 
drained the remaining fluid. A repeat CT shows no pneumonia or 
signs of malignancy. We had endocrine see you who recommended 
seeing an ophthalmologist for your hyperthyroidism. We removed 
nearly 8 liters of fluid from you for a heart failure 
exacerbation. We are changing your Lasix to Toresemide which is 
better absorbed. We are discharging you on 30 mg daily. Please 
follow up with your cardiologist for labs and adjustment of the 
dose. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you the best!
Your ___ Team.

Coronary Anatomy
Left main coronary artery: Normal.
Left anterior descending coronary artery: The proximal and mid 
LAD had minor irregularities and the diagonal branches were 
small caliber but patent. There was a total occlusion of the 
drug eluting stent in
the LAD that appeared to have marked intimal hyperplasia within 
the stent after recanalization.
There is a 16 mm long, 100% stenosis in the Mid LAD. The 
restenotic lesion has a TIMI flow of 0, has no thrombus present, 
has mild calcification noted, and was previously treated with a 
stent procedure. This
lesion is further described as tubular. An intervention was 
performed on the Mid LAD with a final stenosis of 0%. There were 
no lesion complications. The final TIMI flow was 3.
Left circumflex coronary artery: The left circumflex was a large 
vessel that provided OMB and left posterolateral branches.
Right coronary artery: The RCA has up to 30% irregularites in 
the proximal and mid RCA. There appeared be stents in the mid 
RCA. The distal RCA had minimal irregularities and terminated in 
a PDA and posterolateral branches without disease. There were 
collaterals from right to left to the mid and distal LAD.
Interventional Details
Unfractionated heparin and tirofiban were used for 
anticoagulation to an ACT > 300 seconds.
A 6 ___ XB-LAD 3.5 provided good support for the procedure. A 
300 cm 0.014 BMW wire crossed the lesion with minimal dificulty 
over a OTW 2.5 x 8mm Apex balloon as backup. We first ""dottered"" 
the lesion
and flow was restored. The 2.5 mm balloon was inflated to 20 
atms. A 2.5 x 16 mm Promus Premier Rx was deployed at 16 ATM for 
30 secs. The stent was posted dilated with a 2.5 x 15 mm balloon 
at 24 atms for 20 secs.
Final angiogram revealed no residual stenosis, TIMI 3 flow and 
no evidence of dissection or rupture.
The patient left the cath lab pain free and with stable vistal 
signs.

Intra-procedural Complications: None.
Impressions:
1. Anterior STEMI due to single vessel coronary artery disease 
in the LAD with in stent restenosis and thrombus
2. Successful drug eluting stent for in-stent restenosis and 
thrombosis of the LAD 
Recommendations
1. Aspirin - clopigogrel - tirofiban x 4 hours
2. Medical therapy

___ TTE
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function 
(LVEF>55%). There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal left 
ventricle, and dyskinesis of the true apex. The remaining 
segments contract normally (biplane LVEF = 58 %). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
regional dysfunction c/w CAD and MI. Suggestion of impaired LV 
relaxation. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Mildly dilated 
thoracic aorta.

feeling well. That night, however, he developed ___ chest pain 
with slight increase in ST elevation in V4 on an EKG. He was 
placed on a nitroglycerin drip and was able to be titrated to be 
chest pain free. An instantaneous thrombosis of the second stent 
was considered, but given that the ST changes were not 
significant, there were no reciprocal changes, and the patient 
seemed relatively in no acute distress (someone with 
rethrombosis would appear more uncomfortable), it was decided

heart catheterization, which looked at your heart's blood 
vessels. There, we found that one of your previous stents was 
blocked with a clot, which was causing the heart attack. To open 
up this vessel, a second stent was placed within the first 
stent. After the procedure, you were placed on an IV medication 
called nitroglycerin overnight to relieve your chest pain, but 
you were able to get weaned off that medication the next day and 
stay chest pain free, which was very reassuring for a successful 
procedure. 

Moving forward, please note the following:
- New medications: Clopidogrel 75mg daily, atorvastatin 80mg 
daily
- Changed medications: Aspirin 81mg (decreased dose)
- Stopped medications: Simvastatin
- Please weigh yourself every morning, and call your 
cardiologist if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs in a day, or 
more than 5lbs in a week.
- We would recommend cardiac rehabilitation post-discharge.

We wish you the best,
Your ___ care team

He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) related to in-stent restenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was prescribed medications including Plavix, heparin, and nitroglycerin.

The patient has a history of multiple stents placed in the RCA and LAD arteries, as well as balloon angioplasty of a totally occluded RCA. He has also had a cardiac catheterization procedure in the past, which showed multi-vessel disease and multiple everolimus-eluting stents were placed.

The patient's allergies include shellfish, and he has a history of anginal symptoms, which are usually relieved with rest. He has used sublingual nitroglycerin several times in the past 9 months.

The patient's physical examination was normal, with no signs of distress or discomfort. His laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial infarction. He was discharged with medications and instructions to follow up with his cardiologist."

Discharge Diagnosis:
A polyp of the ascending colon

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a Laparoscopic Right 
Colectomy for surgical management of your polyp. You have 
recovered from this procedure well and you are now ready to 
return home. Samples of tissue were taken and this tissue has 
been sent to the pathology department for analysis. You will 
receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. 
If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact you 
regarding these results they will contact you before this time. 
You have tolerated a regular diet, are passing gas and your pain 
is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return 
home to finish your recovery.  
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is 
acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office.

If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office 
for advice ___: 
fever greater than 101.5
increasing abdominal distension
increasing abdominal pain 
nausea/vomiting
inability to tolerate food or liquids
prolonged loose stool
extended constipation  
inability to urinate

Incisions:
You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen 
which are closed with internal sutures. These are healing well 
however it is important that you monitor these areas for signs 
and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the 
incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, 
increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at 
the incision, or swelling of the area.

You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. 
The small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with 
steri-strips (little white adhesive strips), these will fall off 
over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or 
swimming until cleared by the surgical team. 

Pain
It is expected that you will have pain after surgery and this 
pain will gradually improved over the first week or so you are 
home. You will especially have pain when changing positions and 
with movement. You should continue to take 2 Extra Strength 
Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock and you 
may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every hours for 7 days. 
Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or 
any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold 
medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. Please take 
Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your 
pain to a point where you can ambulate and preform minor tasks, 
you should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication 
Oxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take 
with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a 
car if taking narcotic pain medications. 

Activity
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for up to 6 weeks after 
surgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 
weeks. You may climb stairs. You may go outside and walk, but 
avoid traveling long distances until you speak with your 
surgical team at your first follow-up visit. Your surgical team 
will clear you for heavier exercise and activity as the observe 
your progress at your follow-up appointment. You should only 
drive a car on your own if you are off narcotic pain medications 
and feel as if your reaction time is back to normal so you can 
react appropriately while driving. 

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 60-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for a laparoscopic right colectomy due to a right cecal polyp. She has a history of anxiety, benign hematuria, hypertension, normal pap smear, obesity, stress incontinence, tubal ligation, right knee mass, cystocele, stage III CKD, right renal cyst, and ? type colon polyp, ? gastritis, dysplastic colon polyp, and colonic polyps. She has no known allergies or adverse drug reactions.

History of Present Illness:
History is obtained from the medical record and from the patient 
with her son serving as interpreter. Please see also OMR notes 
by Dr. ___ ___ ___ for 
additional information. Briefly, Ms. ___ is a ___ year old 
___ woman who has multiple medical problems including 
diet-controlled type II diabetes, hypertension, chronic joint 
pain (osteoarthritis and seronegative RA vs. PMR), and recent 
visual problems with ocular discomfort. She has had recent 
complaints of chest pain and progressive dyspnea on exertion (to 
the point where she has had to crawl up stairs and sit down 
while shopping) for which she has been evaluated by Dr. 
___. 
.
In terms of her chest pain and DOE, she describes both as 
occurring together. The chest pain is present constantly, 
ranging from severity of ___ to ___ and is worse with 
movement, pressure to the chest wall, deep breathing, or 
exertion. The shortness of breath is only with activity and does 
not occur at rest. She describes the chest pain as pressure-like 
in quality and occuring in the center chest to beneath the left 
breast. She has had these symptoms for several months but feels 
that they have been getting worse recently. She has had a cough 
for about the last two months which is occasionally productive 
of ___ sputum; she initially thought that this was due to a 
cold and had some associated runny nose, though now feels cough 
is not due to URI as it has persisted.
.
She underwent echocardiogram in ___ which showed mild LVH 
with preserved ejection fraction (> 55%) and was otherwise 
unrevealing in terms of etiology for her dyspnea. In addition, 
she has had periodic complaints of heart palpitations for which 
she was been monitored by ___ of Hearts; 7 symptomatic episodes 
revealed sinus rhythm at rate ___ with occasional APBs and 
atrial bigeminy.  She did undergo stress test back in ___ by 
___ which was negative for ischemia, but has had no 
further stress testing since that time. Currently, she is 
awaiting ophthalmologic procedure for her eye discomfort, and 
her ophthalmologist at ___ Eye & ___ has recommended complete 
cardiac work up prior to this procedure (details unclear as 
notes are out of our system; however, per Dr. ___ 
note from ___ it is ""non urgent""). In addition, per Dr. 
___ from ___, cardiac catheterization is 
indicated to evaluate for left main disease prior to surgery 
requiring monitored anesthesia care, as well as to further 
evaluate for coronary artery disease given her multiple risk 
factors for atherosclerosis.  She had cardiac catheterization 
planned recently, although this procedure was cancelled given 
her aspirin allergy and the possible need for intervention. The 
patient was given the option of waiting for allergy appointment 
to further evaluate this allergy or for CCU admission for rapid 
desensitization, and chose the latter.
.  
On review of systems, she denies any recent fever, chills, 
nightsweats or rigors. She denies prior history of stroke, TIA, 
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time 
of surgery. No PND or clear orthopnea (must sleep on her side 
secondary to back/spine pain). She does have swelling of the 
ankles which has been stable, as well as swelling in the knees 
from her arthritis (L > R). She has had palpitations for which 
___ has worn ___ monitor as above. She has multiple myalgias and 
joint pains for which she is followed in ___ clinic; 
these are stable. Cough as per HPI with no hemoptysis. No 
N/V/D/C, no abdominal pain, no changes in bowel habits (last BM 
this morning, normal), no black stools or red stools. She has 
had several episodes of LH over the past several days, most

CXR (___):
In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung 
volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse 
diameter of the heart. There is fullness of indistinct pulmonary 
vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, 
beyond that which would be expected with poor inspiration on a 
portable examination. 

Cardiac Cath (___): 
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed 
no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LMCA 
was free 
from angiographic disease.  The LAD had mild plaquing. The 
ostial 
diagonal branch demonstrated 60% focal stenosis.  The LCx was a 
small 
vessel giving rise to a large OM1 (functionally a ramus 
intermedis) and 
four other tiny OMs.  The RCA was a large dominant vessel with 
mild 
plaquing. 
  
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided 
filling 
pressures with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and LVEDP of 18 mm Hg. There 
was 
moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 
52 mm Hg. 
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.17 L/min/m2.  There was 
significant 
systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP 181 mmHg.  
Diastolic 
blood pressures was 82 mm Hg. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 
___ F with multiple medical problems and recent complaints of 
worsening dyspnea on exertion who presents for planned CCU 
admission for aspirin desensitization prior to cardiac 
catheterization for further work up of DOE.  
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# Diastolic CHF: Pt has diastolic CHF based on cardiac cath, and 
given the absence of coronary disease, this is likely the cause 
of her exertional dyspnea. This is consistent with her 
longstanding history of HTN. She was diuresed with IV lasix and 
her home lasix was increased to 20mg po daily. She was also 
started on metoprolol succinate 50 mg qday and lisinopril 2.5mg 
po qday. At the time of discharge she was asymptomatic and her 
weight was 64.5kg.  
.
# Pulmonary HTN: Pt has significant pulmonary HTN (PA pressure 
52/___) based on cardiac cath, and this is likely also 
contributing to exertional dyspnea. This is likely ___ her left 
sided diastolic CHF, but given history of bronchiectasis, cannot 
rule out a primary pulmonary component to her elevated PA 
pressures. She was discarged on ACEI, diuretic and beta blocker 
per above. 
.
# ASA Allergy: Pt underwent successful ASA desensitization. ASA 
reaction is documented as urticaria/angioedema, but during 
desensitization she only experienced pruritis without other 
manifestations of hypersensitivity. She was desensitized per 
___ protocol without indicent and should continue taking ASA 
81 indefinately to prevent recurrence of hypersensitivity.  
.
# HTN: Her metoprolol tartrate 25mg qday was changed to 
metoprolol succinate 50mg qday. Her lasix was increaed to 10mg 
qday and she was started on lisinopril 2.5mg qday. Her BP was 
well controlled on this regemin while hospitalzied, but her 
medications should be further titrated by her PCP as an 
outpatient.
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.
# DIABETES: Last HbA1c in ___ was 5.7%. Currently off all 
medication. She was covered with ISS while in house her BG was 
well controlled
.  
# ANEMIA: Her home folic acid and B12 were continued. Her Hct 
remained stable in the low/normal range throughout her hospital 
course and no intervention was undertaken.
.  
# JOINT PAIN: Multifactorial (has RA vs. PMR and osteoarthritis 
by history, also status post bilateral total knee arthroplasty). 
She was continued on her home Voltaren 1% gel, sulfasalazine and 
Ca/Vit D and her pain was well controlled on tylenol prn. Pt is 
followed by rheum, who will see her as an outpatient. 
.  
# VASOACTIVE SYMPTOMS S/P MENOPAUSE: She was continued on her 
home Premarin 0.9 mg PO daily; should follow up with PCP 
regarding weaning estrogen. 
.  
# PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES: She was contined on her home mirtazapine 
and venlafaxine. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: She was discahrged home with Cardiology, 
PCP, ___ and Allergy/Immunology follow up. Dietary teaching 
was performed regarding the importance of low Na diet and 
warning signs about fluid overload.

Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness and incoordination
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endobronchial biopsy of right and left lung nodules

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with a history of
prostate CA s/p radiation, hyperlipidemia, cervical spine
disease, and longstanding tobacco use who presents with left
sided weakness and incoordination over the last 10 days. He
reports that he had ""the flu"" about 6 weeks ago with URI 
symptoms
and muscle aches. This resolved, but then about 2 weeks ago he
began to have muscle aches again that felt very similar. These
started in his left quadriceps and then spread over the next
several days to involve his bilateral quadriceps, calves, and
triceps as well. He saw his PCP ___ ___ for his annual physical
and then again on ___ due to the persistent myalgias. At that
point he had also begun to experience intermittent vertigo as
well. This was only present with movement such as turning his
head or standing up to walk and resolved completely at rest. He
describes it as a brief sensation of spinning or movement 
lasting
seconds. CK and ESR were checked due to the myalgias and were
negative. His vertigo was felt to be most likely peripheral.
Basic labs were all normal and he was advised to monitor his
symptoms. 

However over the next week his vertigo persisted, still only
brought on by movement, and he also began to notice weakness in
his left arm and leg. He initially attributed this to the muscle
aches, which ultimately resolved on the right but have still
persisted a little in his left quad and triceps. However over 
the
last week he has also noticed that it is more difficult to
control his left arm and leg. He says they feel weak but also
clumsy, and his arm ""flops around"" when he tries to use it. His
wife says he also veers toward the left when he walks, and his
left leg has ""given out"" on him a couple of times. He has fallen
twice in the last week, once when getting out of the car and 
then
again yesterday when he was trying to help his wife make up the
bed. Both times his left leg just seemed to buckle and he fell 
to
the ground, sustaining some scrapes but no significant injuries.
Last night he was playing cards with his friends, which he has
done for ___ years, and realized that he couldn't hold the cards
or shuffle with his left hand. At this point he became 
concerned,
as he says one of his other friends in the group had a stroke a
few years ago with very similar symptoms. He therefore went back
to Dr. ___ this morning, and on exam he was found to
have left sided weakness and ataxia and was sent to the ED for
further evaluation.

In addition he also reports one episode of headache last week on
___, around the time that he first noticed the left sided
weakness. He describes the headache as bifrontal pressure with 
no
other associated symptoms. This was a bit unusual for him as he
does not typically get headaches but it resolved on its own and
has not recurred. He also noticed brief blurring of vision in 
his
left eye around the same time which also lasted for about a day
and then resolved. He denies any diplopia or loss of vision. He
reports that he has chronic tingling in his left arm and hand 
due
to an ulnar nerve injury many years ago, but this has seemed a
bit more prominent lately than usual. He denies any numbness or
tingling in his face or leg. He denies any problems with his
speech.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, diplopia, 
dysarthria,
dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech. No bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills (since his flu-like illness 6 weeks ago).  No night 
sweats
or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of 
breath.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

PATHOLOGY: 
- Lung biopsies (___): ***PATHOLOGY PENDING***

STUDIES: 

- NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT (___): Findings concerning for multiple 
intracranial lesions which raises suspicion for metastatic 
disease.  Correlate with history of malignancy. MRI would be 
helpful for further evaluation. 

- CTA HEAD/NECK (___):  
1. Three distinct heterogeneously-enhancing parenchymal lesions, 
with cystic necrosis, within the superior cerebellar vermis, and 
the left frontal and parietal lobe, worrisome for metastatic 
disease. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
2. Mild effacement of the left ambient cistern. 
3. 2.7 cm soft tissue mass within the azygos lobe with an 
associated 3.2 cm necrotic precarinal lymph node which may 
represent primary bronchogenic neoplasm with metastatic 
lymphadenopathy. 
4. Patent vasculature. No aneurysm, dissection, or stenosis. 

- MRI BRAIN W/WO GAD (___): 
1. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior frontal and left 
medial 
occipital regions, which may be leptomeningeal or superficial 
cortical, 
without significant mass effect. Punctate left superior frontal 
cortical 
metastasis adjacent to the larger left frontal metastasis. 
2. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior cerebellar vermis 
and left 
cerebellar hemisphere. The dominant metastasis in the left 
cerebellar vermis effaces the left ambient cistern with 
deformation of the left inferior colliculus. It also partially 
effaces the fourth ventricle without obstructive hydrocephalus. 
3. 4 mm enhancing lesion in the superior right aspect of the 
occipital bone, corresponding to a lytic lesion with erosion of 
the outer table on the prior CT, indicating an osseous 
metastasis. 
  
COMMENT: The appearance of the intracranial and calvarial 
lesions is more suggestive of metastatic disease from the right 
apical pulmonary mass seen on the preceding CTA, than from 
prostate cancer, but tissue diagnosis is needed. 

CT ___ W CONTRAST (___):  
1. Multiple enlarged low-attenuation mediastinal lymph nodes and 
right hilar lymph node. A 1.4 cm subpleural nodule in the right 
upper lobe. Adjacent to/contiguous with the necrotic right upper 
paratracheal lymph node. Multiple pulmonary nodules identified 
measuring up to 5 mm. Findings are suspicious of pulmonary and 
nodal metastases. The mediastinal lymph nodes are amenable for 
biopsy via bronchoscopy. 
2. A 1.5 cm and 1.6 cm hypodense lesions in segment 2 and 4B 
nonspecific but suspicious for hepatic metastasis, especially 
segment 4B lesion. 
3. 3.5 cm solid lesion identified posterior to the left psoas 
muscle, 
suspicious for metastasis. This lesion is amenable for biopsy 
under CT 
guidance, if necessary. 
4. Enlarged necrotic lymph nodes at the left external iliac and 
left common iliac chain, suspicious for nodal metastases. 
5. Cholelithiasis. Small hiatal hernia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo RH M with a history of prostate CA s/p radiation, 
hyperlipidemia, cervical spine disease, and tobacco use who 
presents with left sided weakness and incoordination over the 
last 10 days. In the ED, head CT showed 3 lesions with central 
hemorrhage/necrosis and vasogenic edema in the left frontal 
lobe, left parietal lobe, and most notably in the left 
cerebellar vermis coming close to impinging on the ___ 
ventricle, with no hydrocephalus. CTA head/neck incidentally 
revealed a mass in the right upper lung with adjacent necrotic 
lymph nodes. The findings were highly concerning for metastatic 
cancer. 

# HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Neurology service for 
further workup. MRI brain confirmed presence of hemorrhagic 
metastases in the left frontal and parietal lobes and left 
cerebellar hemisphere with small amount of vasogenic edema. CT 
torso revealed multiple lesions concerning for metastatic cancer 
-- enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, 1.4cm RUL nodule and 
multiple other pulmonary nodules, 2 liver lesions, solid lesion 
posterior to the left psoas, and enlarged necrotic left iliac 
lymph nodes. Given his smoking history and distribution of the 
lesions, findings were highly suspicious for metastatic lung 
cancer. 

The next day an endobronchial biopsy of the right lung and LNs 
was obtained by Interventional Pulmonology (results pending on 
discharge). Hematology-Oncology, Neuro-Oncology, Neurosurgery 
and Radiation Oncology services consulted for workup and 
planning. Given the size of the cerebellar mass and its close 
proximity to the ___ ventricle, it was felt that patient would 
need whole brain radiation (fractionated radiotherapy to the 
area would cause too much swelling and thus hydrocephalus, and 
surgical resection would be unsafe given his age and 
comorbidities). After much debate, it was decided that he needed 
EVD placed before beginning whole brain XRT since risk for 
subsequent edema and hydrocephalus was still high. This will be 
performed one week after discharge, on ___ -- 
patient will be called beforehand with time and name of 
neurosurgeon doing the procedure. Following EVD placement, he 
will see Radiation Oncology (Dr. ___ in clinic to begin 
planning for whole-brain radiation. They anticipate beginning 
XRT one week after surgery in order to allow superficial wound 
healing. 

Patient was started on Dexamethasone 4mg qAM (with GI 
prophylaxis) in the hospital for additional for additional 
protection against vasogenic edema. He was also given oxycodone 
on discharge for left hip pain caused by metastases to the area, 
which cause him significant discomfort. 

At the time of discharge, results of the lung biopsy are still 
pending. Once they return, Heme-Onc will coordinate follow up 
and planning for systemic therapy in the appropriate clinic 
(most likely Thoracic Oncology, given high suspicion that this 
is lung cancer). 

Patient was seen by Social Work in the hospital to address 
coping with his new diagnosis and for assistance obtaining 
long-term disability and transportation to future appointments 
at ___. 

====================

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for new clumsiness and 
weakness on the left side of your body. An MRI of your brain 
showed 3 masses concerning for metastatic cancer, one of which 
was in an area called the CEREBELLUM and carries a high risk for 
causing brain cancer (HYDROCEPHALUS). A subsequent CT scan of 
your torso showed masses in your lymph nodes, lungs and liver 
also concerning for cancer. A lung biopsy was performed, results 
pending. 

The next step in your care will be to start whole brain 
radiation. Before this, you will need a ventriculo-peritoneal 
(VP) shunt. This will be done on ___. You will 
be called by the Neurosurgery apartment with the name of the 
surgeon who will perform the operation and the time of surgery. 

Approximately 3 days after shunt placement, you should attend 
your follow-up appointment with Radiation Oncology. They will 
coordination your radiation plan, as well as your follow-up 
appointments with Neuro-Oncology (___). You will be 
called by them to schedule this appointment in the next few 
days.

You are scheduled for an outpatient with Medical Oncology (Dr. 
___ on ___ to discuss the results of your lung 
biopsy, which should have returned by them. See below for more 
info. They will plan your systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or 
radiation) once the lung biopsy results have returned. 

We made the following changes to your medications: 
1. STARTED Dexamethasone (Decadron) 4mg by mouth in AM -- this 
is to treat swelling of the brain due to cancer. 
2. STARTED Famotidine 20mg twice daily -- this is to prevent 
acid reflux caused by Decadron. 
3. STARTED Oxycodone 2.5-5mg every 6 hrs as needed for pain -- 
side effects include nausea and constipation. Can take over the 
counter laxative as needed.
4. STARTED Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg every 8 hrs as needed for 
nausea -- if experienced as side effect of oxycodone.

Endorses a small amount of SOB due to tightness. Denies CP, 
fevers, vomiting. He does take lisinopril, has been taking it 
for approximately one year. 

Presented to OSH received decadron, benadryl, pepcid. Patient 
states that at presentation to OSH, his swelling was so severe 
that he was unable to talk, and had to communicate with staff 
there through writing. Normal soft tissue x-ray per report.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6 95 126/77 16 99%RA. Patient 
recieved inhaled racemic epinephrine x1 and ENT was consulted 
who scoped him and deemed that his swelling appears 
hypopharyngeal with mild epiglottal swelling.  Vocal cords 
appeared normal. Patient continued to be stridorous in the ED, 
so MICU bed was requested.  No plans for intubation at that 
time. 
 
On arrival to the MICU, patient states that he feels markedly 
improved (""If I was a ___ at OSH, I'm now a ___. He endorses 
a mild discomfort in his throat, but this is far less than he

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o HTN, diabetes, and asthma presents with cough, sore 
throat and sensation throat swelling x1 day. 

# Airway swelling: Patient given decadron, diphenhydramine and 
famotidine at OSH for concern of angioedema and upper airway 
swelling, transferred here for ENT and anesthesia evaluation 
should intubation be required. Receieved nebulized racemic 
epinephrine in the ED here. Upon arrival to the MICU the patient 
was subjectively improved. The etiology of his angioedema was 
unclear, but there was concern for contribution of symptoms from 
ACEi. As a result, his ACEi was discontinued while in the MICU, 
and was not restarted upon discharge. He was treated with 
steroids, benadryl, and famotidine. ENT evaulation on the 
morning of discharge revealed resolution of edema and he was 
discharged home from the MICU. 

# Cough/Rhinorrhea: Patient's complaints of cough and rhinorrhea 
recently were most likely due to URI. CXR was without evidence 
of PNA. He was treated with saline nasal spray while in the 
MICU. 

# Tachycardia: Likely in the acute setting of receiving IV 
steroids and epinephrine. Appears to be sinus tachycardia on 
monitor. Troponin from the ED was negative.

# Asthma: Upon arrival to the MICU he was noted to have diffuse 
wheezes on exam. He was given Albuterol nebulizers as needed.

# Diabetes: No active issues. He was discharged on his home dose 
of metformin. 

# HTN: Lisinopril was discontinued upon arrival to the MICU. His 
blood pressure remained within the normal range. He was not 
restarted on any additional anti-hypertensive medications prior 
to discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient will likely need treatment with alternative 
antihypertensive medication, given discontinuation of 
lisinopril. MICU team elected to defer to PCP on this decision.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

 It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization.  You were admitted because of swelling in your 
throat (angioedema) that was causing difficulty breathing.  You 
were admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit so we could 
closely monitor your breathing.  You did very well overnight and 
were treated with steroids, benadryl, and famotidine 
(anti-histamines) which helped to reduce the swelling.  We think 
this swelling was a side effect of your lisinopril.  You should 
not take lisinopril or other medicines in this class (ACE 
inhibitors) ever again as the swelling could happen again 
causing difficulty breathing.  You will need to talk to your PCP 
about starting ___ different blood pressure medicine.  You should 
also talk to your PCP about seeing an Allergy specialist to 
determine if there is another reason for the swelling you had.
  You were also wheezing when you were admitted.  This was 
because of your asthma.  You improved after a treatment with 
albuterol.  Your asthma can be better controlled if you take 
your Flovent inhaler every day - this helps control asthma 
symptoms.  We will give you a prescription for an albuterol 
inhaler that you should only use when you are having symptoms 
from your asthma.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 49-year-old male who presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of throat swelling. He has a history of asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. He was taking lisinopril for hypertension, but it was discontinued during his hospital stay due to concerns about its potential contribution to his angioedema. The patient's symptoms included a sensation of throat swelling, rhinorrhea, and a cough productive of whitish sputum. He was treated with steroids, benadryl, and famotidine, and his angioedema resolved. He was also diagnosed with asthma and treated with albuterol nebulizers as needed. The patient was discharged home with a diagnosis of angioedema and asthma, and was prescribed medications including diphenhydramine, famotidine, prednisone, albuterol inhaler, fluticasone propionate, and metformin."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital with low 
platelets, which was caused by your ___ syndrome.  We were 
planning to place a port to assist with medication 
administration and transfusions; unfortunately, your platelets 
were too low, so you were admitted to the hospital for 
treatment. We gave you steroids and 2 doses of IVIG, and your 
platelets came back up to a safe level, and the port was placed 
without any problems.  After a period of monitoring to ensure 
that there was no bleeding around the port, you were discharged 
home.

While you were here, we also started you on a medication called 
fluconazole to treat you for what might be a fungal infection in 
your throat.  We think that this might be the cause of your 
difficulty swallowing.  You will take this medication for a 
total of two weeks.  If you do not feel better after completing 
this, talk to your primary care physician about seeing ___ 
gastroenterologist, as you could have a different type of 
infection in your throat that requires further treatment.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ F with history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis 
c/b diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension and 
encephalopathy currently on transplant list, IDDM, HTN and HLD 
who was directly admitted from home for acute renal failure.
  
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr < 1.5. Admitted with 
creatinine of 2.0, FeNa on admission 0.28% indicating pre-renal 
state. No evidence of infection on admission without fevers, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, suprapubic tenderness or dysuria, UA 
with epis and does not indicate UTI. Patient received albumin 
1g/kg (62.5grams) on HD 1 and morning after creatinine improved 
to 1.7. On HD 2 H/H was low so instead of albumin patient was 
volume challenged with 1 unit PRBCs and 25grams of albumin (1 
unit PRBCs=25 grams albumin). Diagnostic paracentesis ruled out 
SBP. Creatinine worsened after initial volume challenge and did 
not respond to second round of 1g/kg albumin. After failed 
improvement diagnosis of hepatorenal synrome was made and 
midodrine/octreotide were started and uptitrated without 
improvement in creatinine.  Cr steadily continued to rise, 
patient became oliguric and was volume overloaded.  The renal 
team was consulted.  Initially, plan was for pt to have HD line 
placed in ___ and start dialysis.  However, given active bleeding 
(see below), she was trasferred to SICU and started on CVVH.
       
# Cirrhosis: Chronic, related to schistosomiasis complicated by 
diuretic refractory ascites, chronic renal failure, portal 
hypertension, thrombocytopenia, prior SBP and encephalopathy. 
MELD 20 on admission with Childs Class C. Without evidence of 
encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation or asterixis on 
admission. Continued Rifaximin 550mg PO BID and Lactulose TID 
for HE prophylaxis. Continued Ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. 
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed and ruled out SBP. No GI 
endoscopy in our system but patient being evaluated for 
transplant, cannot be on transplant list without endoscopy so 
presumably completed somewhere. MELD rose to >30 in setting of 
hepatorenal syndrome and patient was listed for ABO incompatible 
liver. As HRS progressed, MELD score was at 40 on transfer to 
the SICU.

# Pulmonary edema: Pt w/ pulm edema on CXR on ___ and mildly 
symptomatic. Initially, pt subjectively some SOB, but O2 low to 
mid ___ on RA.  After 2 days, developed O2 requirement.  
Overload most likely in the setting of rapidly deteriorating 
renal function.  Less likely cirrhosis induced cardiomyopathy.  
Last TTE ___ with normal EF.  Repeat TTE with still normal EF 
but new moderate PA systolic HTN. Attempted to diurese with 
Lasix 20 iv then 80, put out very small amt of urine, 
incontinent.   In setting of rapidly progressive HRS, pt became 
oliguric and was unable to mobilize fluid.  Plan was made for 
dialysis as above.

# Hard palate bleed:  On ___ at ~6am, pt developed bleed right 
hard palate.  This was likely ___ mild oral trauma in the 
setting of coagulopathy--INR 3.6, platelets 75.  Initially, 
attempted to stop by applying pressure, unsuccessful.  Per 
discussion with ENT and OMFS, attempted to stop the bleed with 
afrin soaked gauze, topical thrombin, silver nitrate, 
aminocaproic acid.  Also transfused with platelets, FFP, and 
RBCs (as hct was 22 down from 25 at last check). Held continuous 
pressure for ~3 hours.  As soon as pressure was released, active 
bleeding was visualized.  Tamponaded bleed for ~10 minutes, but 
again continued to have uncontrollable bleed and was transferred 
to SICU on the transplant surgery service for elective 
intubation and packing.  The lesion was cauterized and the 
bleeding was controlled.  She was initially successfully 
extubated at transferred to the floor. 

# Hyponatremia: Hypervolumic hyponatremia from cirrhosis. Did 
not diurese patient given ___. Albumin and PRBCs given for 
intravascular volume and patient kept on 1.5L fluid restricted 
diet. She remained hyponatremic so fluid restricted further to 
1.2L with improvement in Na.
    
# Acute anemia: Patient with chronic anemia related to cirrhosis 
though with acute drop on HD 2. Unclear etiology without GIB 
during admission. Unknown if patient has varices without 
endoscopy in our system and is not on beta-blocker so presumably 
none on prior endoscopy. Possible hct drop was in setting of 
volume challenge overnight and dilutional effect though WBC and 
platelets unchanged. She was transfused 1 unit PRBCs both for 
anemia and volume challenge. Hct remained stable following 
transfusion.
     
# DM: Insulin Dependent, Type II. Hyperglycemic during admissin. 
Continued Glargine 12 units qHS and HISS
    
# HLD: Chronic, stable, continue zetia 
   
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Continue holding diuretics
- Recommend tracking down endoscopy report, unknown where 
completed

ICU Course ___ to ___, date of death)
Ms ___ was transferred to the surgical ICU the morning of 
___ after developing worsening melena. She had an EGD the day 
prior for the purpose of Dobhoff feeding tube placement, and 
during that EGD a duodenal polyp was noted and biopsied. Of 
note, she had an INR of 2.5 and fibrinogen of 59 prior to the 
procedure so snare removal of the polyp was deferred. The 
evening following the EGD, she had several episodes of melena 
thus prompting transfer to the ICU to facilitate repeat emergent 
EGD. The EGD ___ showed a lot of old blood around the polyp, but 
no active bleed from the stalk. 
The first few days in the SICU she remained HD stable, but 
continued to have melena with an unstable hematocrit. We 
transfused RBC, FFP, platelets and cryo to goal Hct of 30 and 
correct her coagulopathy. We were unable to completely correct 
her, and she began having significant oral bleeding. By ___, 
she was coughing blood, had an increased oxygen requirement. She 
remained encephalopathic and was not protecting her airway 
sufficiently so she was intubated. After intubation she had a 
pressor requirement which remained until time of death. She was 
started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/mica) and a CT 
torso showed severe pneumonia with very little residual aerated 
lung volume. 
On ___ she was begun on CVVH for acidosis and had increased 
pressor requirement with the addition of vasopressin. We 
continued to transfuse RBC/FFP/cryo to maintain blood levels.
On ___ she had increased pressor requirement and markedly 
increased oral bleeding. It was estimated she bleed 600cc 
periorally this day. Transfusions continued and she remained on 
high dose levo/vaso, though her pressor requirement was slightly 
less than the day prior. A family meeting was held. It was 
decided she would not want to be on full life support for more 
than 5 days. As it had been 3 days to this point, we decided to 
make a final decision ___ unless she acutely worsened.
On ___, the day of her death, she acutely worsened during the 
day. She became hypotensive despite increasing her pressor 
doses. Melena and oral bleeding increased and she grew 
increasingly tachycardic. She was not responding hemodynamically 
to significant product transfusion, and her ventilator settings 
were increased with more oxygen needed. Another family meeting 
was held and we discussed that she was decompensating rapidly 
and likely had an unsurvivable condition. The family present was 
receptive and understanding. She was transitioned to comfort 
care at 7pm, though the endotracheal tube was left in to prevent 
aspirating blood which we felt would cause her too much 
discomfort. She was started on a morphine drip. Her heart rate 
and blood pressure gradually declined and asystole occured at 
9:28pm. She was declared at 9:30pm. The family declined an 
autopsy.

Output:","The patient is a 69-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure. She has a history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and encephalopathy, and is currently on the transplant list. She was recently discharged from another hospital where she was admitted for abdominal distension, and was directly admitted to this hospital for acute renal failure. The patient's past medical history includes schistosomiasis complicated by cirrhosis and ascites, hypertension, IDDM, dyslipidemia, and nephrolithiasis.

The patient's allergies include aspirin. She has a history of bleeding, including a recent episode of hematochezia and melena, and has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome. She has also been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and has required oxygen therapy.

The patient's medications at discharge include midodrine and octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome, and rifaximin and lactulose for prophylaxis against hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient underwent several procedures during her hospital stay, including a diagnostic paracentesis, which ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and an EGD with feeding tube placement and duodenal polyp biopsy. She also underwent a TTE, which showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, including ALT, AST, and LDH, as well as elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Her creatinine level was elevated at 2.0 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was elevated at 28 mg/dL. Her albumin level was low at 3.7 g/dL, and her calcium level was elevated at 9.8 mg/dL.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was complicated by her underlying liver disease and acute renal failure, and she required multiple interventions to manage her symptoms and stabilize her condition."

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Urinary retention - POD1 foley removed and patient unable to 
void, straight cath x 1, failed voiding trial again, foley 
replaced POD1 eve and removed again on POD3, voising trial 
pending.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the 
surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without 
erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.
 
She is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Wet to dry dressing changes

What to Expect at Home

Your doctor or nurse may ask you to change your dressing at 
home. By placing a wet (or moist) gauze dressing in your wound 
and allowing it to dry, wound drainage and dead tissue can be 
removed when you take off the old dressing. 

As the wound heals, you should not need as much gauze (or 
packing gauze). 

Removing the Old Dressing

Follow these steps to remove your dressing: 

Wash your hands. 
Put on a pair of non-sterile gloves. 
Carefully remove the tape. 
Remove the old dressing. If it is sticking to your skin, wet it 
with warm water to loosen it. 
Remove the gauze pads or packing tape from inside your wound. 
Put the old dressing, packing material, and your gloves in a 
plastic bag. Set the bag aside. 
Wash your hands again
Cleaning Your Wound

Follow these steps to clean your wound: 

Put on a new pair of non-sterile gloves. 

Use a soft washcloth to gently clean your wound with warm water 
and soap. Your wound should not bleed much when you are cleaning 
it, but a small amount of blood is okay. Rinse your wound with 
water, and gently pat it dry with a clean towel. Do not rub it 
dry. 

Check the wound for 

Increased redness or swelling 
A bad odor 
Drainage that is darker or thicker
After cleaning your wound, remove your gloves and put them in 
the plastic bag with the old dressing and gloves. 
Wash your hands again.

Changing Your Dressing

Follow these steps to put a new dressing on: 

Put on a new pair of non-sterile gloves. 
Pour saline into a clean bowl. Place gauze pads and any packing 
tape you will use in the bowl. 
Squeeze the saline from the gauze pads or packing tape until it 
is no longer dripping. 
Place the gauze pads or packing tape in your wound. 
Carefully fill in the wound and any spaces under the skin. 
Do not let the wet gauze or packing tape touch any healed skin.
Cover the wet gauze or packing tape with a large dry dressing 
pad. Use tape or rolled gauze to hold this dressing in place. 
Put all used supplies in the plastic bag. Close it securely, 
then put it in a second plastic bag, and close that bag 
securely. Put it in the trash. 

Wash your hands again when you are finished.

When to ___ the Doctor

___ your doctor if you have any of these changes around your 
incision: 

More redness 
More pain 
Swelling 
Bleeding 
The wound is larger or deeper 
The wound looks dried out or dark
Also ___ your doctor if: 

Your temperature is above 100 °F for more than 4 hours

IMAGING:

ECG on admission: Sinus bradycardia. Tiny inferior Q waves could 
represent recent or prior inferior myocardial infarction. Right 
ventricular conduction delay not meeting full criteria for right 
bundle-branch block. J point elevation in the lateral leads. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the findings are 
similar. 

Cardiac catheterization ___ preliminary: 
COMMENTS:      
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 

demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary 
artery 
disease.  The LMCA was a very short vessel with no 
angiographically 
apparent diseas.  The LAD and LCx were both large caliber 
vessels with 
no angiographically apparent disease.  The RCA had minimal 
luminal 
irregularities. 
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided 
filling 
pressures with an LVEDP of 27 mmHg.  There was no aortic 
stenosis noted 
on pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta. 
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a normal ejection fraction 
with no 
wall motion abnormalities.  There was no mitral regurgitation. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery 
disease. 
2. Normal ventricular function. 
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressure. 
4. No aortic stenosis. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
change.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male who presented to ___ for acute 
chest pain at rest, was transferred for code STEMI with mild ST 
elevations in inferior leads and T wave inversions in 
anterolateral leads, and was found to have positive cardiac 
biomarkers and mild luminal irregularities in the coronaries on 
catheterization.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Chest pain/elevated troponin: Unclear etiology of pain, but 
unlikely to be coronary artery disease given that patient denies 
angina symptoms, only cardiovascular risk factor is remote 
tobacco use, and there is no evidence of coronary artery disease 
on catheterization. It is possible that polycythemia ___ could 
have precipitated thrombosis in a distal branch not noted on 
catheterization.  Vasospasm is also a possibility, but there is 
no report of cocaine abuse.  Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy was 
considered unlikely given normal left ventriculogram, and 
unlikely to be myocarditis given patient does not have symptoms 
of congestive heart failure and URI symptoms only started 2 days 
ago with a normal echocardiogram.  Another possibility could be 
pulmonary embolus as patient did have hypoxia on presentation, 
however patient was not tachycardic, Wells score was 0 and 
D-dimer was normal.  Cardiac biomarkers were trended, showing 
elevations in troponin and CK-MB, which were trending down at 
the time of discharge.  Patient was started on aspirin 325 mg 
daily and metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.  Cardiac MR was 
ordered for outpatient workup to further delineate a cause of 
the patient symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.  He was chest 
pain free at the time of discharge.  Close follow-up was 
arranged with a cardiologist, as well as the patient's PCP.  
  
# Pump function: patient appeared euvolemic on exam, with no 
prior history of heart disease.  Echocardiogram revealed no 
abnormalities in heart function.  
.  
# Heart rhythm: Patient was in normal sinus rhythm with 8 beats 
of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight that was 
asymptomatic.  

# Polycythemia ___: patient is currently getting phlebotomy 
every 2 weeks.  He was arranged for outpatient hematology 
follow-up upon discharge.
  
TRANSITION OF CARE
------------------  
Code status: patient is confirmed full code  

Follow-up: patient will require a cardiac MR upon discharge, and 
is scheduled up for follow-up with cardiology.  His cholesterol 
panel returned after discharge and should be followed up by the 
outpatient cardiologist.   He will require follow-up with his 
outpatient hematologist for his polycythemia ___.  He also has 
scheduled follow-up with his PCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the ___ Spine Surgery Service on 
___ and taken to the Operating Room for L3-S1 interbody 
fusion through an anterior approach. Please refer to the 
dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was 
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU 
in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for 
postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were 
given per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled 
with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the operating room for a 
scheduled T12-L3 decompression with PSIF as part of a staged 
2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated operative note 
for further details. The second surgery was also without 
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a 
stable condition. Postoperative HCT was stable. On HD#3 she 
returned for a scheduled T10-S1 posterior fusion with 
instrumentation.  A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at 
the time of the posterior surgery remained in place until postop 
day one. 
She developed a post-operative ileus and an NG tube was placed.  
The ileuse was slowly resolving and NG tube was removed with 
diet advanced.  
She developed acute distension and was transferred to the TICU 
for monitoring. There, an NG tube was placed and her abdomen was 
decompressed.  CT scan showed no sign of blockage.
She was subsequently transferred out of the TICU and monitored.
She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was 
advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain 
medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley remained in place due 
to post-op urinary incontenance.  This will be managed by her 
PCP. She was fitted with a TLSO brace for ambulation. Physical 
therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Hospital 
course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day of discharge the 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on 
oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet. 
 
Medications on Admission:

femoral to axillary bypass PFTE graft ___ admitted with right 
groin wound dehiscence and S. anginosus and MSSA bacteremia with 
course c/b rupture of a mycotic aneurysm at his femoral graft 
site. 

VASCULAR: Right groin wound was packed, and patient was started 
on vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl and admitted to the vascular 
surgery service. Admission blood cultures grew strep anginosus 
and wound swab was polymicrobial including MSSA and e Coli. CT 
angiogram was concerning for infection at the site of bypass 
graft anastamosis with the femoral artery. ID was consulted, who 
recommended transition to Zosyn. Pt was then pre-oped and 
consented for surgery for infected right femoral axillary 
bypass. Coumadin was stopped in preperation of surgery. He was 
on a heparin drip for his mechanical valve. 

CTA: 
  
1. Widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with 
minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the 
bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site. Although, 
no drainable 
fluid collections or abscesses are seen, this would be 
concerning for 
infection in the presence of clinical symptoms. 
  
2. Stable appearance of the ascending thoracic aortic graft and 
widely patent 
left axillary to femoral bypass graft. Normal appearance of the 
abdominal 
aorta and its major visceral branches. 
  
3. Unchanged appearance of an isodense right lower pole renal 
lesion and 
multiple indeterminate left renal lesions since the earlier 
study. These can 
be further evaluated by renal CTA protocol if this has not 
evaluated before. 

He was taken to the OR after developing several small bleeds 
from his operative site concerning for herald bleeds from a 
ruptured aneurysm. In the OR on ___ he was found to have fresh 
clotted blood at his femoral graft site with concern for a 
disrupted femoral anastomosis. He was found to have inflammatory 
changes in his retroperitoneum and a large inflammatory phlegmon 
at his rectus. The distal portion of his axillofemoral graft was 
detached and a saphenous vein graft was placed. 

___ - Exploration of right groin, control of the external iliac 
artery via a retroperitoneal exposure, excision of distal 
portion of the axillary-femoral bypass,
and vein patch repair of the femoral artery with saphenous vein 
patch.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

Due to his massive bleeding and transfusion requirements, he 
developed abdominal compartment syndrome overnight and was taken 
back to the OR on ___ for exploration of retroperitoneal space, 
washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, 
packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the 
abdominal incision which was left open. 

___ - Exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of 
retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the 
retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision 
which was left open.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

___ - Abdominal packing removal, Abdominal washout, Temporary 
abdominal closure.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

___ - Abdominal closure with mesh.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR. 

On ___ patient had decreased urine output in setting of 
increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, 
which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and 
muscle paralysis. Neo was weaned. Sedation was transitioned to 
Precedex and vent was changed to PSV, with improvement in 
alertnent. 

Patient was noted to have elevated LFTs; RUQ ultrasound showed 
no abnormalities and LFTs trended downward. Systolic blood 
pressure rose to 200s with agitation, which responded to 
Fentanyl and hydralazine. 

On ___ patient was extubated. Patient passed bedside swallow 
eval and was transition to oral nutrition. 

On ___ patient was transferred from the CVICU to the VICU.

In the VICU to floor non incidental, The rest of the Hospital 
course will by systems:

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient narcotics IV with good 
effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, 
the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. 

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored. Pt also has Mechanical 
Valve was on IV heparin with transition tocoumadin on DC

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen 
to encourage bowel movement. Pt did have trouble with nutrion, 
started on dronabinol  2.5 mg PO BID. Pt also had loose stools - 
neg C Diff x 3, d/c'ed IV flagyl per ID

GU: Foley was removed when apprpriate. Intake and output were 
closely monitored. Pt did have acute on chronic renal failure. 
On ___ patient had decreased urine output in setting of 
increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, 
which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and 
muscle paralysis

ID: ID consult, Was originally on IV vanco . PO cipro / PO 
flagyl. ID transitioned to IV Zosyn - to be on a total of 6 
weeks, then PO supression therapy for life. Name of ___ 
to be determined. The patient's temperature was closely watched 
for signs of infection. 

He waa dmitted on ___ with a wound dehiscence and fever. ___ 
blood cultures drawn ___ grew S. anginosus as well as MSSA on 
___ and ___. A wound swab of the right groin site has grown 
MSSA as well as mixed flora. A CT Torso on ___ showed ""a widely 
patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic 
site."" A TEE was performed showed ""a well-seated bi-leaflet 
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with normal leaflet motion 
and gradients. No discrete vegetations."" 

The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam for 
coverage of S. anginosus and MSSA BSI as well as a polymicrobial 
wound infection. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. 

On day of discharge, pt's BUN/creat =65/2.6, thought to be 
likely due to dehydration. IVF bolus was given with maintenance 
IVF to continue at rehab until creatinine trends down. PO fluids 
also encouraged. Lasix was discontinued and ___ should not be 
restarted until creatinine at baseline. VAC was also 
discontinued and  should continue on wet to dry BID until follow 
up. Foley was reinserted for urinary retention of approx 600 cc 
urine. Please attempt voiding trial in a day or so. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, 
voiding with foley, and pain was well controlled.

Imaging:

R Ankle XR ___:
IMPRESSION: 
 
Extensive chronic, partially postoperative changes without 
definite evidence
of osteomyelitis.  Please note that MRI is more sensitive for 
early
osteomyelitis.
No evidence of hardware failure.

CT RLE ___:
IMPRESSION: 
 
1.  Findings worrisome for calcaneal ulcer with associated 
phlegmon.  Doubt
drainable fluid collection.  However, no IV contrast was 
administered to
confirm the presence of a fluid collection.
2.  No CT findings pathognomic for osteomyelitis, but the 
presence of early
osteomyelitis in the setting of these advanced bony changes 
would be difficult
to exclude.
3.  Status post hindfoot fusion and resection of the distal 
fibula.  No
hardware loosening or failure detected in the hindfoot.  The 
anterior portion
of the talus is absent and a fibular graft is noted in the 
resection bed.
4.  Advanced bony disruption in the midfoot, compatible with 
Charcot
osteoarthropathy.  Of note, bony fragments are seen in the 
region of the
tarsal tunnel.
4.  2 pins within distal first metatarsal osteotomy.  Status 
post osseous
fusion of first IP joint, with screw across the joint.
5.  Diffuse subcutaneous edema along dorsum of foot.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  If persistent concern for osteomyelitis 
consider tagged
WBC and sulfur colloid study for further evaluation.  Of note MR 
is more
sensitive in the detection of acute osteomyelitis however given 
adjacent
hardware MR evaluation will LIKELY be limited.

Pathology of Bedside bone bx ___: 
Fibro-purulent exudate with associated fragments of necrotic 
bone. 

CXR ___:
In comparison with study of ___, there again are low lung 
volumes that
accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette seen on the 
image from an
outside facility.  No definite vascular congestion or acute 
focal pneumonia.
There is an placement of a right subclavian PICC line, the tip 
of which is
very difficult to identify.  Oblique view or a repeat radiograph 
using
abdominal technique could be obtained to ascertain the position 
of the tip.

CXR ___:
FINDINGS: 
 
The right PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There 
is no focal
consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or 
pneumothorax.  The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Right PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  No acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of CNS Lymphoma who was admitted for C5 HD 
MTX at 8 gm/m2 and also found to have new symptomatic DVT.

CNS LYMPHOMA
He tolerated C5 methotrexate per protocol well with IV and PO 
alkalanization with bicarb and leucovorin per rescue. He did 
have some mild nausea. Per neuro oncology his dexamethasone was 
tapered down to 1mg daily. Neuro oncology will arrange for a 
brain MRI to be done as an outpatient and then determine his 
future chemotherapy course base on that. Prior to discharge his 
methotrexate level was less than 0.1. 

DVT
- The patient reported leg cramping and a lower extremity 
Doppler was done which showed a DVT. He was started on lovenox. 
A LMWH level was still pending at the time of discharge which 
can be followed up as an outpatient but is expected to be fine 
as he was started on weight based dosing.

Lip Ulcer
- Likely herpes labialis (ie herpes simplex type 1). In context 
of
receiving chemotherapy, discussed with ___ and 
started
acyclovir for both treatment and for suppression.

Elevated ALT
- This has been chronically mildly elevated, potentially from

SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS
Other symptoms may indicate that a clot in the leg has broken 
off and traveled to the lung, causing a pulmonary embolism. 
These may include:
* New chest pain with difficulty breathing
* A rapid heart rate and/or a feeling of passing out
This complication may be life-threatening and requires immediate 
attention. Emergency medical services are available in most 
areas of the ___ by calling 911.
Bleeding  Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin can have 
serious side effects and should be taken exactly as directed. If 
a dose is forgotten, the patient should call his/her healthcare 
provider or clinic for advice. 
Patients may bleed easily while taking anticoagulants. Bleeding 
may develop in many areas, such as the nose or gums, excessive 
menstrual bleeding, bleeding in the urine or feces, bleeding or 
excessive bruising in the skin, as well as vomiting material 
that is bright red or dark brown like coffee grounds. In some 
cases, bleeding can develop inside the body and not be noticed 
immediately. Bleeding inside the body can cause a person to feel 
faint, or have pain in the back or abdomen. A healthcare 
provider should be notified immediately if there is any sign of 
this problem. A healthcare provider should also be notified 
immediately if the patient on anticoagulants sustained an injury 
that could lead to bleeding inside the body.
Reduce the risk of bleeding  Some simple modifications can 
limit the risk of bleeding:
Use a soft bristle toothbrush
Shave with an electric razor rather than a blade
Take care when using scissors or knives
Avoid potentially harmful activities (eg, contact sports)
Use appropriate safety equipment (eg, helmets, padding) during 
physical activity
Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal antiinflammatory 
agents (NSAIDS) (eg, ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, Nuprin) 
unless directed to do so by a healthcare provider. Other 
nonprescription pain medications, such as acetaminophen, may be 
a safe alternative.

FINDINGS:  
  
Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged at 158ml end-diastolic 
volume (normal to 110ml).   
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a partially reversible 
inferolateral perfusion defect.  Gated images reveal 
hypokinesis, particularly in the inferior territory.  
  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 40%. 
  No prior study for comparison. 
  
IMPRESSION:  1) Partially reversible inferolateral perfusion 
defect. 
  2) Dilated LV end-diastolic volume. 
  3) Decreased LV ejection fraction of 40%. 

___ CT ABD/PELVIS
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Near complete resolution of previously demonstrated residual 
rectal wall
thickening. Focal sacculations just proximal to an area of 
stricture in the
proximal rectum relate to pseudo-diverticula/sacculations, 
largest measuring
up to 3 cm. No evidence of fistula formation on this 
examination.
2. Significant circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening 
may relate to
cystitis versus chronic outlet obstruction.
3. Mild to moderate hydronephrosis of the right pelvic 
transplant kidney,
likely accentuated due to distended bladder.

___ COLONOSCOPY
Diffuse ulcerations and structuring of distal sigmoid and 
proximal and mid rectum. 

___ UE US
IMPRESSION:
 
1. A central line is visualized in the right basilic vein with 
minimal
nonocclusive thrombus.
2. Occlusive thrombus in a superficial vein in the posterior 
forearm.
3. Cephalic vein is not visualized. Otherwise, no evidence of 
deep vein
thrombosis in the right upper extremity.

___ ABD/PELVIS
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Interval improvement of ischemic colitis. Persistent abnormal 
wall
thickening of the distal rectosigmoid colon with pericolonic 
edema and fat
stranding.   Previously noted rectosigmoid pneumatosis has 
resolved.
2. Large stool burden throughout the colon, substantially 
increased since 3
weeks before.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M w/ ESRD s/p DCD renal transplant 
in ___ on cellcept/tacro, s/p MVC ___ yrs ago w/ chronic 
neurogenic bladder c/b recurrent UTIs, HTN, diabetes, and recent 
prolonged hospitalization for septic shock c/b ischemic colitis, 
presenting with abdominal pain. He underwent aggressive bowel 
regimen with large stool burden and had a colonoscopy concerning 
for ischemic colitis. He was seen by CRS with no recommended 
surgical intervention. Course was complicated by UTI with MDR 
e.coli, and he underwent pMIBI which did not identify any 
reversible perfusion defect per cardiology consultation team. He 
will follow up with CRS, cardiology, and transplant nephrology 
as an outpatient and is discharged to skilled nursing facility.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#. Abdominal Pain 
#. Hx of Ischemic/C.Diff Colitis
Patient with imaging initially significant for improving 
colitis, persistent proctocolitis, and large stool burden. 
Abdominal pain though to be most likely ___ to large stool 
burden, so was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen. CRS was 
consulted without acute surgical need. ID was consulted as he 
was scheduled to followup with them as outpatient, who d/c'd his 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl which he was on from his previous course. 
The patient was scheduled for outpatient flex sig, so GI was 
consulted to perform in house. His prep was successful and he 
underwent a full colonoscopy, which was significant for erosion, 
ulceration and strictures, concerning for ischemic colitis, 
along with ? of diverticuli or fistulas. He underwent a CT with 
rectal contrast with no signs of fistulas. He was again seen by 
CRS with no plan for surgical intervention. He was kept on 
standing bowel regimen. MMF dose was decreased due to initial 
concern for MMF colitis but due to low suspicion on colonoscopy 
findings for MMF toxicity this was increased to 500 bid from 
250.

#. ESRD s/p DCD Renal Transplant 
#. Neurogenic Bladder
Renal U/S fairly unremarkable. Creatinine peaked at 1.7 thought 
to be in the setting of pre-renal ___ from large volume diarrhea 
and improved with fluids. He was kept on MMF 250mg BID, tacro to 
1.5 BID,  Bactrim ppx, and home oxybutynin. His home lisinopril 
was held on discharge.

#. MDR E.coli CAUTI
>100,000 CFU of e.coli in UA noted when had leukocytosis. ID was 
consulted who recommended meropenem until ___. He will continue 
po vanc through ___ for c. diff prophylaxis. He was discharged 
on ___ 500 mg q6h. If necessary can switch to ertapenem 1g 
q24hrs per ID consult for dosing convenience.

#. H/o NSTEMI
During last hospitalization had suspicion for type II NSTEMI 
with ischemic bowel, with plan for outpatient cardiac cath. In 
the setting of potential surgical planning, cardiology was 
consulted, who recommended avoiding surgery unless urgently 
needed and to obtain pMIBI which was read as having partially 
reversible perfusion defect but cardiology consult team 
concluded there was no reversible defect. He was continued on 
ASA, rosuvastatin, metoprolol.

#. Acute on  Chronic Back Pain
Seen by chronic pain who recommended continuing home Vicodin 
7.5mg/325mg while in house.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
#. Afib
Currently appears in sinus rhythm. 
Continued Metoprolol for rate control while AC still held due to 
bleeding risk 

#. HTN
- Continued home amlodipine and held home lisinopril as above 

#. DMII
Continued home glargine 32 and standing Humalog 2 with meals

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

You were here because you were having abdominal pain. You were 
seen by the gastrointestinal (GI) team and the colorectal team, 
who felt that you had a lot of extra stool that was causing the 
pain. You also had a colonoscopy, which showed ulcers and narrow 
areas of your colon. Fortunately, the colorectal surgery team 
did not think you needed surgery. You had a stress test which 
did not show any active areas of decrease blood flow to your 
heart, and the cardiology team concluded that you would not 
benefit from an invasive procedure to look at the vessels of 
your heart. You were also found to have a urinary tract 
infection, for which you are discharged on a course of 
antibiotics through your PICC which will continue through ___. 
You will continue oral vancomycin through ___ to prevent c. diff 
infection.

When you leave, it is important you take your medications as 
prescribed. It is also important you keep your appointments as 
listed below. You will follow-up with cardiology and colorectal 
surgery as an outpatient as well as transplant nephrology.

We wish you the best of luck!

Your ___ Care Team

REGARDING YOUR MEDICATIONS
Here is a list of new medications and their purpose:

Gabapentin: for pain and neuropathy
Hydrocodone-acetaminophen: for pain, as needed
Meropenem: antibiotic for urinary tract infection
Polyethylene glycol: for constipation
Senna: for constipation
Trazodone: for insomnia

Other medications:
Aspirin: to decrease risk of future heart attack/stroke
Rosuvastatin: to decrease cholesterol and future risk of heart 
attack/stroke
Metoprolol: helps the heart heal and has a small effect on blood 
pressure

We held your Lisinopril due to a slight increase in your 
creatinine this admission. We will defer to Dr. ___ to 
restart this medication.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a renal transplant. He has a neurogenic bladder, hypertension, diabetes, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). He was recently hospitalized for septic shock caused by ischemic colitis and Klebsiella urosepsis. He was treated with antibiotics and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, where he developed worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea. He was transferred to the emergency department, where he was found to have a large stool burden and continued evidence of proctocolitis. He was diagnosed with partially reversible inferolateral perfusion defect and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. He was also found to have a urinary tract infection caused by multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli).

The patient's allergies include antihistamines and glipizide. He has a history of chronic back pain, COPD, DM2, HTN, HLD, and recurrent UTIs. He has also had a colon adenomatous polyp and umbilical hernia repair.

awoke mildly confused but slowly cleared mentally. She was 
transfused with two units of packed red blood cells for 
postoperative anemia. Mrs. ___ developed atrial 
fibrillation for which amioadrone and coumadin was started. On 
postoperative day two, she was transferred to the step down unit 
for further recovery. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were 
resumed. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative 
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted to assist 
with her postoperative strength and mobility. She became 
confused and was pancultured given her WBC of 20. Her INR rose

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in position. 
Bilateral
pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Left base opacity 
may represent combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, 
although underlying consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.
.
CT Head ___:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
TTE ___:
.
CXR Portable ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tip of left IJL abuts wall of the upper SVC.
2. Worsening mild to moderate congestive heart failure.
.
EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG study since 
the
background was disorganized and slightly slow consistent with a 
mild
diffuse encephalopathy of non-specific etiology. Superimposed 
frontally
predominant delta activity was seen with stimulation during 
bedside care
and likely represents a pattern of arousal. No epileptiform 
discharges
or electrographic seizures were recorded. This EEG show a 
significant
improvement compared to previous day's recording as background 
frequency
is faster at 7.5 Hz (compared to 5 Hz on the previous day) and 
some
normal sleep morphologies were also noted.
.
Chest Portable ___:
There is new almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe. 
There is no
pneumothorax. Small right and moderate left pleural effusions 
are unchanged. Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left 
side. Left IJ catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC.
.
EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG study. 
Background
was markedly attenuated and slow with admixed faster frontal 
rhythms
that were interrupted by brief periods of marked suppression. 
These
findings are indicative of an underlying moderate encephalopathy 
most
likely related to the effect of sedative medications. The 
background
was reactive in response to physical stimulation. No 
epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures were present.
.
CXR Portable ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube appropriately retracted to 5 cm above the 
carina.
2. Resolution of pulmonary edema.
3. Stable moderate left greater than right bilateral pleural 
effusions.
4. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
.
CXR Portable ___:
.
The feeding tube, left IJ catheter and endotracheal tube are 
unchanged in
position. There is persistent cardiomegaly. There is unchanged 
left
retrocardiac opacity. There are no signs for overt pulmonary 
edema. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion as well. 
Overall, these findings are stable.
.
CXR Portable ___:
The endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right IJ central venous 
catheter are stable in position. There is again seen 
cardiomegaly and left retrocardiac opacity, which is unchanged. 
There are no pneumothoraces or signs for overt pulmonary edema. 
A small right-sided pleural effusion is also present.
.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ___:
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: A video oropharyngeal swallow study 
was
performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow team. 
Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered. The patient could not 
fully
cooperate due to mental status, although limited swallows of 
nectar and
honey-thickened liquids showed no obvious aspiration. Please see 
speech and
swallow note in OMR for complete details.
.
Arterial Duplex Extremity Exam ___:
FINDINGS: Focal exam in the area of trauma was performed. There 
is a large
area of flow interpose between the arterial and venous 
anastomosis. This most likely represents an aneurysmal 
dilatation arising off the draining vein rather than any 
disruption of the anastomosis. There is persistent flow with 
expected waveforms throughout the draining vein up through to 
the subclavian vein. Findings were transmitted to the referring 
physician at the time of initial performance of this scan.
.
CXR PA/LAT ___:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
Small left pleural effusion has decreased substantially since 
___.
Small right pleural effusion or more likely right pleural 
scarring, unchanged. New transvenous right ventricular pacer 
defibrillator lead in standard placement. Moderate cardiomegaly, 
unchanged. No pulmonary or mediastinal vascular engorgement. No 
pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Lungs are grossly clear.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with history of HTN, IDDM, NiCMY, nonobstructing 
CAD, and ESRD on HD admitted after cardiac arrest with cooling 
protocol found to be hypokalemic with chronic prolonged qtc and 
polymorphic VT now extubated and s/p placement of single chamber 
ICD.
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# Cardiac arrest s/p ICD placement: Pt had VT to Vfib arrest at 
dialysis center assessed as being the result of baseline 
prolonged QT interval (chronic per old EKG's obtained from ___) 
in the setting of electrolyte shifts during dialysis, most 
notably hypokalemia. Our thinking was that hypokalemia 
predisposed her to early after depolarizations with R on T 
phenomena making her more likely to have a degenerating rhythm 
due to her long QT. She had a long and eventful hospital course 
including undergoing arctic sun cooling and re-warming, 
successful extubation following prior failed attempt (she 
required re-intubation due to mucous plugging), and gradual 
recovery of her baseline mental status. She required frequent 
work with ___ and speech and swallow to resume PO intake. She was 
dialyzed in-house by the renal team who recommended she be 
dialyzed using a high K bath in the future to maintain her K 
around 5. Additionally, EP was consulted and after a significant 
amount of consideration and deliberation it was determined that 
she would benefit from a single chamber ICD which was placed 
despite concerns regarding her multiple comorbidities. She had 
evidence of significant ectopy on telemetry throughout her 
hospitalization including frequent PVC's and occasional runs of 
NSVT. She was discharged to rehab for continued recovery of her 
physical function. ICD dressing was removed on ___ and steri 
strips should stay in place until after her ICD check on 
___. 
.
# ESRD ON HD: Stable. She was maintained on her MWF dialysis 
schedule with high K buffer with goal K of 5. She did not have 
any significant arrythmias during dialysis but during one 
session she rolled onto the dialysis needle and punctured her 
graft. Doppler study was obtained which demonstrated her graft 
was intact and vascular surgery evaluated and stated it was okay 
for further dialysis. She has a large resolving hematoma 
proximal to the fistula. 
.
# Poor PO Intake/Severe Physical Deconditioning: Pt worked with 
speech and swallow almost daily to enhance her ability to take 
in nutrition by mouth. She was also seen by the nutrition 
service as it was felt she would be aided in her physical 
recovery with improved nutritional status. She was discharged to 
a rehab facility to aid in recovery of her physical functional 
status.
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.
# Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: Stable. She was managed 
in-house on a combination of long acting and humalog sliding 
scale. She is very sensitive to insulin and has had episodes of 
hypoglycemia. 
.
# HTN: Stable. On admission she had an unconventional 
antihypertensive regimen including significant doses of 
clonidine and hydralazine. She was gradually tapered off her 
regimen and it was replaced with carvedilol and lisinopril.
.
# CAD:  History of nonobstructive CAD but without ischemic 
changes on EKG's and without positive cardiac enzymes. She was 
treated with aspirin and atorvastatin as well as her blood 
pressure regimen above.
. 
# Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:  History of 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45%. Her TSH was wnls and 
her HIV negative. She was treated with a heart failure regimen 
including carvedilol and lisinopril.
.  
# Hypothyroidism: Her TSH was wnl's on admission. Her home 
synthroid was held as her history of hypothyroidism was 
questionable and it was unclear if it played any role in her 
cardiac excitability and subsequent cardiac arrest. Following 
her recovery, her TSH was checked once again and was found to be 
3.0 and she was re-started on her home synthroid.
.
# Chronic back pain: Pt with hx of chronic low back pain on 
narcotics as a home med but was oftentimes very somnolent, 
especially when taking these medications so they were 
discontinued. She infrequently complained of pain which was 
treated conservatively with tylenol and ibuprofen. 
.
# Questionable History of Epilepsy: Pt with questionable history 
of epilepsy on keppra as a home medication. She underwent EEG 
testing for >24 hours without any epileptiform discharges and 
there was concern that prior episodes of syncope (cardiogenic or 
otherwise) had been misinterpreted as epilepsy. Her keppra was 
held given her initially cloudy mental status and she did not 
have any seizure-like activity during her lengthy admission. 
Keppra was restarted at discharge but pt should see a 
neurologist in follow up to assess if this medication is truly 
needed. 
.
# Anxiety: Pt described significant anxiety related to her 
medical condition and trivial things such as fear of the dark. 
She was seen by the psychiatry team who recommended small 
standing doses of ativan (a home med) which was attempted but 
oftentimes left her somnolent and difficult to evaluate. These 
medications were held and her mental status improved 
significantly.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
.
#She will need close supervision during dialysis and will need a 
high K bath to maintain K at goal of 5.
.
#She will need device clinic follow-up for her new single 
chamber ICD. Given her severe diabetes and ESRD, she is at 
increased risk of complications related to her device including 
pocket infections and should be monitored carefully.
.
#She will need to AVOID QT PROLONGING MEDICATIONS as these can 
cause a life-threatening arrythmia to occur in her given her 
underlying prolonged QT interval
.
#She will need significant rehabilitation as she is severely 
deconditioned
.
#She will need close follow up with her primary care doctor to 
tackle her ___ social and medical issues. Attempts were made to 
attempt that process by carefully clarifying her home 
medications, elements of her medical history which seemed 
questionable, and addressing her polypharmacy by eliminating 
unnecessary medications.
.
#She will likely need an outpatient social worker to help her 
cope with her multiple medical issues

History of Present Illness:
___ female with hx of severe COPD on home oxygen, morbid 
obesity, hx CAD s/p PCI, chronic pseudotumor cerebri, presents 
from OSH where she originally presented for an ___ guided lumbar 
puncture for therapeutic drainage. The patient had lost the keys 
to her portable oxygen tanks and went to an OSH for a 
therapeutic LP without her oxygen. However in waiting for her 
procedure, she developed some chest pain and was noted to be 
hypoxic to the 50% on RA. Her chest pain resolved within minutes 
and she was placed on 4L oxygen and her O2 sats went up to 87% 
and an ABG was performed and was ___. A CXR was obtained 
and reportedly had evidence of an infiltrate. She was given 
nebulizers, steroids, and moxifloxacin and was transfered to 
___ for ___ guided lumbar puncture.
.
In the ___ ED, initial VS were: 98 85 159/89 18 91% 4L. She 
received labs notable for lactate 2.4, HCT 54, HCO3 32 and blood 
cultures were sent. CXR showed hyperexpansion without clear 
evidence of an infiltrate or pulmonary edema. She received a CT 
head which was consistent with pseudotumor cerebri. She received 
duonebs and vancomycin was added to her antibiotic regimen. 
Oxygen saturations were in the ___ on 4L NC. She reports her 
baseline oxygenation saturation is 82%. She was admitted to the 
MICU for oxygen monitoring while she awaits ___ guided LP. Access 
includes 2 PIV 20G on the right. 
.  
On arrival to the MICU, she temporarily endorsed mild chest 
heaviness, no radiation, no associated SOB, nausea or 
paresthesias. This pain quickly resolved without intervention. 
She has had chronic headaches, worse lately despite recently 
starting acetazolamide, associated with peripheral vision loss 
and visual scotomas. She is taking vicodin as needed for the 
pain. Denies cough, increased sputum production, wheezing or 
fever/chills. No sick contacts. She feels her breathing is at 
baseline.  
.
Prior to transfer on the floor, the patient reports improvement 
in her breathing and endorses continued headache that involves 
the back of her head and is throbbing in quality. When the 
headaches are at their worst they are associated with blurry 
vision and ""floaters."" She has also noted some crusting and 
dryness of her eyes that she has been treating with blephamide. 
She also endorses increased lethargy, fatigue, and sleepiness 
that she attributes to the narcotic medicine that she has been 
taking to manage her headaches. She has also has reportedly been 
more confused recently, not recounting recent events and has 
been taking less POs. At this time, she denied any fevers, 
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or abdominal 
pain. Of note, her O2 saturations on 2L oxygen are in the high

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with severe COPD on 2L home oxygen, chronic 
pseudotumor cerebri, with underlying chronic hypoxia, presents 
from OSH with hypoxia and headaches here for ___ guided lumbar 
puncture for therapeutic drainage.  
.  
#Hypoxia: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have O2 sats 
in the mid-80s on 4L. Her CXR demonstrated evidence of mild CHF 
and she was diuresed with her home dose of lasix and admitted to 
the MICU for oxygen monitoring. Her acetazolamide was held given 
its potential to exacerbate her hypercarbia. She maintained her 
oxygen saturations and was transferred to the floor where her 
oxygen was weaned to 4L while being treated with her home 
regimen of nebulizers and Spiriva for her history of COPD. Given 
that she had not formally seen a pulmonologist for the workup of 
her hypoxia, she was setup with outpatient follow-up with ___ 
Pulmonary at discharge. It was also felt that the patient likely 
has obstructive sleep apnea given her body habitus, or even some 
hypoventilation syndrome. Given the possible complexity of her 
sleep-breathing patterns, Sleep Medicine recommended that the 
patient follow-up with them in clinic as well, to discuss Sleep 
Study and CPAP/BiPAP.   
.
#Pseudotumor cerebri: Upon admission, the patient complained of 
headaches that were consistent with her history of pseudotumor 
cerebri that was subsequently confirmed on a head-CT. Her 
acetazolamide was held given concern for exacerbating her 
hypercarbia. Throughout her admission, her headaches were stable 
without any visual symptoms and appropriately controlled with 
tylenol and oxycodone. Her aspirin and plavix were held 
(patient's husband reported that he had not given these to her 
X2 weeks given her somnolence on pain meds for her headaches). 
She subsequently received an ___ guided therapeutic LP (___) 
and tolerated it well. Her headaches resolved following her LP 
and aspirin and plavix were restarted. Per the patient, she 
often can go months to years after a therapeutic LP without 
symptoms or need for retapping (last LP in ___. 
.
#Bradycardia: Prior to transfer from the MICU, the patient was 
noted to have HRs in the 40-50s which continued while on the 
floor. She was asymptomatic, and her EKG was notable for sinus 
bradycardia with no conduction defects.  Her metoprolol dose was 
adjusted and her HR increased to the ___ with activity.  She was 
discharged on a lower dose of metoprolol.
.
Inactive Issues:
.
#Eye Crusting: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have 
mild crusting of her left eyelid without any evidence of 
conjunctivitis or blepheritis. She was continued on her home 
blephamide cream and her crusting improved over the course of 
her hospitalization
.  
#CAD and history of MI: During her hospitalization, the patient 
acknowledged some chest heaviness without radiation, dyspnea, 
nausea, or paresthesias that resolved within minutes. Her EKG 
was without ST/T changes and her cardiac enzymes were normal. 
She had no subsequent episodes of chest pain throughout her 
hospitalization and was continued on her home regimen of 
lipitor, metoprolol and imdur. According to records obtained 
from ___ where the patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization in ___, the patient has three Cypher (DES) 
stents in her LAD distribution. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient NEEDS to have outpatient pulmonology follow-up. Her 
pulmonary disease is very poorly controlled at this point and 
she is at risk of rapidly worsening from Cor Pulmonale. This 
information was discussed at length with the patient, who has an 
appointment with ___ Pulmonary. 
- Patient should have outpatient sleep study. She has an 
appointment with ___ Sleep Medicine 
- Please follow-up heart rate as metoprolol dose was adjusted as 
inpatient to 12.5mg BID given bradycardia.
- Patient demonstrates significant interest in smoking 
cessation. QuitWorks and Nicotine patches were provided to the 
patient. She should discuss this with her primary care 
physician, as it will help with her ongoing lung disease

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs. ___,

___ you for allowing us to participate in your care. You were 
admitted to the hospital because you were noted to have very low 
oxygen saturations. You were placed on more oxygen and treated 
with nebulizers for shortness of breath. 

You were also complaining of significant headaches that were 
consistent with your history of pseudotumor cerebri, which was 
confirmed on imaging of your head. You were treated with a 
lumbar puncture which helped resolve your symptoms.

Your heart rates were also noted to be low and we decided to 
decrease your metoprolol dosing, after which your heart rates 
returned to the normal range. We will let your PCP know of this 
change in your medication.

Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxia and headaches. She has a history of severe COPD, pseudotumor cerebri, and myocardial infarction with three stents placed. She is also morbidly obese and has diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's allergies include penicillins, OxyContin, Vicodin, and MS. She was admitted to the MICU for oxygen monitoring and treatment of her hypoxia and headaches. During her admission, she underwent an interventional radiology-guided lumbar puncture and was treated with nebulizers, steroids, and antibiotics.

IMAGING:
CXR ___:
Lungs are low volume with diffuse parenchymal opacification 
within the right lung which is new since the prior study and 
could represent pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  
Follow-up to complete resolution after course of antibiotics in 
___ weeks is recommended.  There are small bilateral effusions 
with mild interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is seen 

ERCP ___:
The scout film revealed previous stents in place. 
What appeared to be an uncovered metal stent was found in the 
bile duct at the major papilla with a plastic double pigtail 
stent inside.  
After biliary plastic stent removal, the bile duct was deeply 
cannulated with the balloon. 
Given suspicion of debris, the bile duct was swept repeatedly 
with the balloon and copious sludge and stones were extracted 
successfully. 
There was some tissue in-growth seen within the stent. 
A small amount of contrast was injected showing patent bile 
ducts proximally at the CHD and intrahepatic branches. 
___ x 5cm double pigtail plastic and ___ x 7cm biliary plastic 
straight stents were placed into the bile duct to facilitate 
drainage. 
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with dementia, hypertension, CAD status post 
LAD stent, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial 
fibrillation, ampullary mass requiring ERCP with stenting 
implicated by recurrent cholangitis, who presented with sepsis 
due to cholangitis.

# Acute cholangitis
# Transaminitis: Patient with history of cholangitis and biliary 
stents presented to OSH on ___ with 3 days of fever, RUQ, and 
jaundice. CT a/p and RUQ ultrasound concerning with common bile 
duct and marked
intrahepatic ductal dilatation and gallbladder sludge without 
evidence of cholecystitis. LFTs on admission were elevated (ALT 
111, AST 56, Alk Phos 423), Tbili 7.6. ERCP performed ERCP ___ 
with removal of plastic stent along with sludge and stones.  
LFTs trended down after the intervention.  She was placed on 
cefpodoxime and metronidazole, transitioned from 
piperacillin-tazobactam, for planned seven-day course, to cover 
both cholangitis and possible pneumonia noted below.  The family 
deferred further intevention (cholecystectomy, scheduled repeat 
ERCP) at this time, and will decide based on if patient requires 
a procedure acutely in the future.

# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
# Pneumonia: Her exam was most consistent with atelectasis in 
the setting of ICU stay and ERCP procedure. 
CHF and aspiration or other pneumonia are remote considerations 
though she appeared to be improving clinically.  Imaging showed 
infiltrates suspicious for pneumonia, so antibiotics for 
cholangitis were chosen to also cover potential pneumonia, as 
noted above.

#Tachycardia
#Atrial flutter
#Atrial fibrillation: She has a history of atrial fibrillation 
for which she takes Atenolol. Upon arrival to the ED, she was 
tachycardic to 154 and EKG showed atrial flutter.  She was given 
2.5 metoprolol.  Home dose of atenolol was later resumed.

#Diabetes: Previously took Metformin 500mg daily. A1C was 6.0 in 
___, so she was instructed to stop taking the 
Metformin.  She was placed on an insulin sliding scale during 
her admission.

#Hypertension: home atenolol was resumed.

#Papillary neoplasm of ampulla of Vater: Hypoechoic mass in the 
periportal region on Ultrasound. Likely at
least in part causing obstruction leading to cholangitis.  She 
will continue to have outpatient follow-up for this, with PCP 
appointment scheduled.

#CAD s/p LAD stent History of CAD and LAD stent. Takes aspirin 
81 mg daily. EKG on presentation had no ischemic changes and 
troponin was <.01.  Aspirin was resumed.

#Dementia
#Anxiety: History of senile dementia with significant anxiety. 
Takes Seroquel 12.5mg TID, which was resumed.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==============
# Follow-up: patient will follow up with her PCP.  The family 
deferred further intevention (cholecystectomy, scheduled repeat 
ERCP) at this time, and will decide based on if patient requires 
a procedure acutely in the future.  

# Code status: Full code but only limited trial.  Admitting 
physician discussed this with her son/HCP and he is considering 
making her DNR. It was explained that this would be quite 
reasonable and that this would not have changed the way we 
treated her during this hospital stay. He said would not want 
her to have a prolonged course of CPR but he is not comfortable 
yet with making her DNR.

angina, moderate AS, bladder cancer s/p resection, CKD, RCC s/p
nephrectomy, anxiety and IBS who presented to ___ emergency
department with chest pain and found to have an NSTEMI. Cath 
showed effective , decision was made to manage medically due to 
no clear culprit lesion, and technical difficulty of attempting 
PCI. His course was complicated by ___ on CKD due to
postrenal ureteral stenosis, now s/p ureteral stent, with
resolving ___ 

# NSTEMI  
# CAD s/p CABG  
Known history of stable angina, with NSTEMI in ___ that
showed patent grafts and severe native vessel disease. Given the
complexity of a possible PCI, he has been medically managed 
since
that time with stable to slightly worsening symptoms. On the day
prior to admission, developed angina and found to have NSTEMI
with troponin-T 0.09 -> 0.20 -> 0.33 prior to angiography. 
Angiography did not demonstrate significant change from ___
study, so will plan to medically manage. His TTE was also not
significantly changed from prior.  Patient has remained chest
pain-free on medical therapy since that time. He will be 
discharged on aspirin, rosuvastatin, metoprolol, IMDUR, and 
ranolazine. His Plavix was d/c-ed.

# Post Renal ___ on CKD stage III
# S/p Ureteral stent (on ___
Cr 1.6 at baseline. 2.3 on admission and 1.8 prior to 
angiography
with pre-hydration. Unclear what precipitated ___ prior to
admission, but good initial response to hydration so pre-renal 
etiology
is likely. Subsequently developed recurrent ___, and found to 
have hydronephrosis. Renal and urology consulted with ureteral 
stent placed on ___ for treatment of hydronephrosis. Post stent 
placement has seen improvement in Cr. Likely suffered from ATN, 
now in diuresis phase. 4.5L of urine on ___, 2 L or urine on 
___. Cr downtrended from 3.4 to 2.8 on
___ and ___, and 2.5 on ___. Also had hyperkalemia on ___, 
which resolved prior to discharge. Patient will keep R ureteral 
stent in place for ___ weeks, will follow up
with Dr. ___ in ___ clinic

#Bradycardia with beta blockade 
Patient has history of intolerance beta blocker with development 
of symptomatic bradycardia. As his angina has been refractory to 
medical therapy, decision was made to place PPM in order to 
uptitrate metoprolol for control of angina.

#Anemia 
Chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline Hgb ~10. Dropped to 
around
8.5 after cath. Pt vitals stable and no back pain, femoral bruit
or decreased distal pulse and Hgb was stable. CBC stable with 
Hgb
in the ___. S/P 1 unit blood ___ for aninga and upcoming
procedure.  Hemoglobin has been stable around 8 since this time.

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Mr ___

 It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  

 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==========================  
 - You were admitted because you had a heart attack  
 
 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==============================  
  - You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest 
pain. You were found to have had a heart attack. Your heart 
arteries were examined (cardiac catheterization) which showed a 
blockage of one of the arteries. This was treated by 
medications.
  -Your kidney function decreased.  This was believed to be due 
to a blockage in the tube leading from the kidney to the 
bladder.  This was treated by our urology team placing a stent 
to open the blockage.

 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
 ================================  
 - It is very important to take your normal aspirin, statin, 
metoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, ranolazine to help manage 
your chest pain
 - It is important to follow up with all of your appointment 
scheduled, which you can find listed on this discharge sheet
 

 Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

He has also had a history of intolerance to beta blockers due to symptomatic bradycardia. 

The patient was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed effective revascularization. However, due to the complexity of possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), he was medically managed instead. 

During his hospital stay, the patient developed acute kidney injury (AKI) due to postrenal ureteral stenosis, which was treated with a ureteral stent. He also had anemia, which was managed with blood transfusions. 

The patient was discharged on medications including aspirin, rosuvastatin, metoprolol, IMDUR, and ranolazine. He will also need to keep a ureteral stent in place for several weeks and follow up with his doctor in clinic."

HPI: ___ year old man with h/o AML s/p myeloablaive sequential 
double cord blood transplant (now day 503) complicated by 
chronic GVHD of the joints who presents with chronic worsening 
joint pain. The patient was seen in clinic today after 
complaining of increased joint pain and excessive fatigue over 
the past two weeks. V/S in clinic were: T 97.4, BP 110/67, P 70, 
R 21, O2 100% 2L NC. Joint pain involves most of his joints 
including the shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles,  and 
has been on-going since his allo cord transplant. Joint pain is 
more severe with ambulation or stair climbing, though he has not 
noticed any of his joints to be warm or to be significantly 
swollen. He also denied having any fevers or chills. He has been 
participating in physical therapy and states taht with passive 
range of motion, he has less pain than with active range of 
motion of his joints. For pain control, the patient had been on 
a regimen of oxycontin 10mg q12h and oxycodone for breakthrough 
pain, but decreased his oxycotin dose to 10mg qhs a few days ago 
in an attempt to reduce his symptoms of nausea/vomiting over the 
past few weeks. In addition, he was only sparinlgy using his 
oxycodone as he did not want to get ""hooked"". While in clinic,

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: ___ year old man with h/o AML s/p allo cord transplant 
complicated by chronic GVHD of the joints who now presents with 
worsening joint pain.  

# GVHD with joint pain: Chronic joint pain and recent 
exacerbation likely due to a combination of GVHD and change in 
narcotics regimen (as patient decreased oxycotin dosage to qhs 
from BID). Uric acid was up to 10.7, but the distribution and 
appearance of joints are not classic for gout. There is no 
swelling, erythema, or decreased range of motion to suggest 
infectious arthritis. CRP 20.3/ESR 55 suggestive of a 
inflammatory process. Efforts were made to improve control of 
his GVHD. In the recent weeks prior to admission Mr ___ 
was switched from Tacrolimus to Cellcept for ongoing nausea and 
vomitting. Mr ___ revealed that he had stoped taking 
plaquinil prior to admission because of his ongoing nausea as 
well. Therefore his plaquinil was discontinued during this 
admission. His predisone was increased from 15mg to 20mg daily 
and he was continued on his home dose of cellcept. He was 
restarted on narcotic regimen of oxycotin 10mg BID and oxycodone 
5mg prn (which was rarely needed). On this regimen his pain and 
energy level improved. He was able to ambulate without 
assistance. He was discharged on the increased predinose dose 
and his home cellcept dose. He was also given OxyContin 10mg BID 
as well as MSIR for breakthrough pain (secondary to oxycodone 
shortage). Further titration of the medications may be necessary 
as an outpatient.
.
# AML: S/p allo cord transplant, now ___ on admission.  The 
transplant was complicated by GVHD as explained above.
.
# Hypotension: On ___ Mr ___ for hypotension 
accompanied by feeling of lightheadness. It did not occur with 
changing position. VS otherwise stable. His blood pressure  
improved with IVF. He was also briefly started on cefepime for 
fear of an underlying infection, however this was quickly stoped 
as he stabilized. The hypotension was in the setting of 
increased use of oxycodone and a one time use of MSIV. The 
hypotension was attributed to sedation from narcotics, his dose 
was decreased without further episodes of hypotension.
.
# Ingrown toenails:  The patient has a history of ___ ingrown 
toenails. He had pain bilaterally in the second toes. There was 
also a small 1 mm area of black discoloration, however 
peripheral pulses were normal, the feet were without other signs 
of ischemia. ABIs were obtained with normal vascular flow in the 
extremities.  Podiatry was consulted and removed the ___ ingrown 
toenails. There was also a small amount of pus on the right toe. 
The patient was treated with bacitracin. He was also started on 
a course of Keflex for the small infection.
.
# Constipation: Bowel regimen implemented with Colace, Senna, 
and Miralex.
.
# GERD: Mr ___ was increased to BID given his 
symptoms of GERD daily despite daily dosing. Further evaluation 
of the GERD should be considered if he continues to have 
symptoms as an outpatient.
.
# Nausea: Patient was experiencing significant nausea / 
vomitting prior to admission.  He did not experience this during 
the admission. The improvement could be secondary to recently 
stoping Tacrolimus or discontinuing Plaquenil. It could also be 
secondary to improved pain control or increased ___ dosing.  
He was discharged with zofran for nausea control.
.
# Diabetes: Continued on home dose of Lantus and ISS
.
# HTN: continued on Carvedilol and lisinopril. Episodic 
hypotension as above
.
# Peripheral neuropathy: Continued gabapentin
.
# H/o Recent BOOP / Aspergillus: Continued on Voriconazole
.
# CKD:  Baseline Cr 1.4 to 2.1 in the past. Cr remained 2.0 to 
2.2 during this admission.

Output:","The patient is a 52-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with worsening joint pain. He has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has undergone a myeloablative double cord blood transplant. He has been experiencing chronic joint pain since his transplant, which has worsened over the past two weeks. The patient has been taking oxycodone for pain control, but has recently decreased his dosage due to nausea and vomiting. He has also been experiencing fever, fatigue, and swelling in his joints.

The patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of AML, sarcoidosis, and chronic GVHD. He has undergone several treatments for his AML, including induction therapy, consolidation therapy, and relapse treatment. He has also received Rituxan for his chronic GVHD.

The patient's physical examination revealed a middle-aged, Cushingoid, overweight man with bilateral 2+ pitting edema to his knees. His joints were tender to palpation, and he had ecchymoses on his abdomen. His laboratory results showed an elevated CRP level, indicating an inflammatory process.

The patient's diagnosis is chronic GVHD with joint pain, likely due to a combination of GVHD and changes in his narcotics regimen. His treatment plan includes increasing his prednisone dosage and discontinuing his plaquinil medication."

1. CXR (___)
Lungs are well expanded, with linear opacities at the lung 
bases, most likely representing atelectasis. However, 
curvilinear opacity could also represent scarring. Heart is 
normal in size, 
and there is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement. Soft tissue 
and bony structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSIONS: Atelectasis 
versus scarring at the left lung base. No acute 
abnormalities. 
2. CT Head w/o Contrast (___)
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, mass 
effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major 
vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are normal 
in caliber and configuration. Visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are well aerated. Osseous structures are 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Loss of Consciousness:
Most likely this was due to hypovolemia given pt's history of 
diarrhea, decreased PO intake and orthostatic symptoms. BP was 
also low on admission. Other concern on admission was for 
cardiogenic syncope.  EKG showed ST-T wave changes with T wave 
inversions in V1-V4 which were unchanged from prior ECGs.  
Troponins and CK were cycled and showed a Troponin of 0.08 which 
did not rise and was likely due to her kidney disease.  Pt had 
no signs of congestive heart failure and an echo was done which 
was normal.  She had no clinical signs of PE.  Has a history of 
seizures and migraines; however no seizure activity was 
observed. TIA/CVA is also unlikely with normal neuro exam. Pt 
also had a history of hypothyroidism and TSH was check and was 
>100.  Free T4 was low at 0.28. Pt has been non-compliant with 
meds in the past but stated that she had not missed any of her 
thyroid medication.  Pt's home pharmacy was called and stated 
that the prescription had last been filled in early ___ but 
had not been filled prior to this.  TSH was checked in the past 
___ and ___ and was elevated at this time as well.  Pt also 
had symptoms of hypothyroidism with weight gain, weakness, 
fatigue, headache and dry skin. Pt was also reported to be 
hypoglycemic on presentation and this could have been a 
contributing factor to syncope with poor oral intake. 
.
On admission, pt was due for dialysis and did undergo HD with 
2.3L removed. On arrival to the floor, BP was low at 80/40.  Pt 
required 2.5L of fluid resuscitation to bring BP to 100s.  She 
was asymptomatic during this time without chest pain, 
lightheadedness or dizziness.  Blood and urine cultures were 
sent and negative.  A urine tox was negative.  Orthostatic BPs 
were checked after fluid resuscitation and were normal.  An 
echocardiogram was done which was normal with an EF of 55%.  Pt 
did well clinically during admission and experienced no other 
symptoms of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.  Her 
anti-hypertensive medications were held in light of her low 
blood pressure.  She was given Levothyroxine at 100mcg/day given 
her low levels of T4 (was previously supposed to be taking 
75mcg/day).
.
The patient experienced no further symptoms of syncope during 
admission.  Telemetry showed no arrhythmias and echocardiogram 
was normal.
.
2. Hypoglycemia:
Pt was hypoglycemic on admission with blood sugar reported to be 
45 at ___. Fingersticks were checked throughout admission and 
blood sugars with in the low-normal range of ___.  LFTs 
were checked for possible causes for hypoglycemia and were with 
AST 45 and ALT 27.
.  
3. Diarrhea: 
Pt stated that diarrhea symptoms had been present prior to 
admission and continued through hospital stay.  Stool cultures 
and ova and parasites were negative.  Likely cause was viral 
gastroenteritis vs. narcotic withdrawal.
. 
4. Substance Abuse: 
Pt was on 120mg methadone daily per ___ clinic.  On date 
of admission, she did not receive this and began to experience 
withdrawal symptoms of anxiety and agitation.  She was given 
120mg of Methadone daily for her hx of narcotic abuse and 
withdrawal symptom prevention. She was given Trazadone 50 qhs as 
per home dose.
. 
5. ESRD:
Nephrology was consulted and pt was dialyzed on date of 
admission as well as on ___ as per home schedule (___). She 
was continued on Calcitriol and calcium carbonate. She tolerated 
dialysis well.
.  
6. Hx of Seizure:
Pt experienced no seizures while admitted. She was continued on 
her home done of Keppra.  
. 
7. Depression
Pt was continued on Fluoxetine.
.
8. Hypothyroidism
As described, pt was hypothyroid with a free T4 of 0.28 and 
unclear if she had been taking Levothyroxine as prescribed.  She 
was put on Levothyroxine 100mcg daily and discharged on this 
dose. She was discharged with ___ services to assist with 
medication compliance. 
.  
9. Asthma
Pt had no asthma symptoms.  Advair was continued.
. 
10. Hospital Prophylaxis:
Pt was put on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis and omeprazole.
.
Code: FULL  
.
Discharge:
Pt was discharged with follow-up in ___ clinic on ___.  She was 
given a prescription for Levothyroxine 100mcg daily with ___

Stool O&P ___: pending

Imaging:
___ CT Abdomen:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Fat stranding in the root of the mesentery with likely 
reactive lymph 
nodes, findings which can be seen with pancreatitis. 
2. Nodular liver contour and splenomegaly, findings suggestive 
of cirrhosis. 
Please correlate clinically. 
3. Right adnexal cystic lesion measuring up to 5 cm. Further 
evaluation with 
pelvic ultrasound recommended. 
4. Multiple new renal lesions including an indeterminate lesion 
on the right. 
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended. 

___ CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary 
process.
___ CXR:  IMPRESSION: Possibly mild progression of previously 
identified bilateral basal plate atelectasis but no full blown 
findings of ARDS infiltrates 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman w/ ESRD on dialysis, HCV cirrhosis, HTN and chronic 
diarrhea presenting with abdominal pain, fevers, nausea/vomiting 
and ongoing diarrhea. Initially, Ms. ___ was found to have a 
mildly elevated Lipase (239) and CT findings consistent with 
acute pancreatitis and was admitted for treatment and further 
evaluation.

# abdominal pain: The location, quality and time course of Ms. 
___ pain were not classic for acute pancreatitis, however, 
her mildly elevated lipase, fat stranding and reactive LN seen 
of abdominal CT were consistent w/ pancreatitis. There was no 
evident CBD dilation or evidence of stones, and the portal veins 
were open with no evidence of thrombosis. Alcohol and 
gallstones, the most common etiologies for pancreatitis were 
unlikely in this case. Triglycerides were checked and found to 
be within normal limits. The patient was treated conservatively 
for acute pancreatitis, made NPO, given narcotic pain control 
and antiemetics. Over the course of her stay her pain localized 
primarily to the left lower quadrant for which there was no 
clear explanation. She had a bimanual pelvic exam and was found 
to have no adnexal tenderness or cervical motion tenderness. An 
adenexal cyst seen incidentally on CT was on the right and could 
not explain her discomfort. Over the course of her stay, Ms. 
___ pain improved. Her diet was advanced, and she was sent 
home only on her baseline Methadone with no further medications 
for pain control. She may benefit from an outpatient MRCP for 
further evaluation of the cause of her pancreatitis.

# diarrhea: Ms. ___ reports ongoing diarrhea for >6mo. Based 
on OMR records and patient report it appears that work-up to 
date has been negative. The bowel appears normal on CT. The 
patient's diarrhea is secretory based on labs and history of 
large volume diarrhea that occurs throughout the day and night. 
The patient's TSH was found to be suppressed to 0.15 which may 
be contributing. Based on an informal recommendation from 
endocrinology her levothyroxine dose was decreased.
Inpatient work-up including stool cultures and O&P were 
negative. A second O&P is pending at the time of discharge. 
Fecal fat is also pending. Outpatient follow up with the 
patient's gastroenterologist was scheduled for further work-up.

# fever: The patient reported intermittent fevers at home up to 
approximately ___. At the time of admission she was afebrile. 
On hospital day number 2 she developed a fever up to ___ 
accompanied shaking chills. Her dialysis was cut short due to 
concern for sepsis and possible exacerbation of her acute 
pancreatitis. The patient was treated with Tylenol and cooling 
packs and her fever resolved. She had no further febrile 
episodes during her stay. Her fever was most likely secondary to 
her pancreatitis although temperatures as high as ___ are 
unusual with uncomplicated pancreatitis. It may also have been 
attributable to a viral illness. Bacterial infection was ruled 
out by blood culture which was negative x 3 ___s CXR with 
no sign of infection. The patient had no respiratory symptoms. 
Urinalysis and urine culture could not be obtained as the 
patient is anuric. The patient was tested for HIV and was found 
to be negative. She reports recent TB testing (often part of 
work-up related to dialysis) which was also negative per her 
report. 
An adnexal cyst was seen on CT which did not appear consistent 
with an abscess. She had no focal adnexal tenderness on bimanual 
exam and no CMT (pt last sexually active ___ ago). Fever could 
also be explained by malignancy. As the patient was reporting 
malaise and an approximately ten pound weight loss over ___ 
months and lymphadenopathy was seen on CT and on exam ___ was 
checked to assess for lymphoma and came back within normal 
limits. No further work-up for malignancy was pursued.

# Leukopenia: Ms. ___ presented with a white blood cell count 
within the normal range. Over the course of her hospital stay 
she developed a leukopenia. This was most likely secondary to a 
viral illness. Her white blood cell count was monitored and 
stabilized prior to discharge. This will be followed up by her 
outpatient Nephrologist at hemodialysis and this abnormality was 
also discussed with her PCP. 

# ESRD: The patient is regularly on a MWF schedule for 
hemodialysis. Her last hemodialysis prior to admission was ___. 
She missed HD on ___, the day of admission. During her 
hospitalization, Ms. ___ was followed by the dialysis team 
and had daily labwork. She went for hemodialysis on ___ which 
was cut short due to worsening clinical status including 
fever/chills leading to concern for sepsis as well as the 
conflict between removing fluid through dialysis and the goal of 
maintaining fluid volume with acute pancreatitis. The patient 
did not receive HD on ___ as based on labs and clinical status 
it was not urgently indicated and the patient had worsened ___ 
w/ hemodialysis. The patient did receive HD ___ and ___.
The patient was hypocalcemic during her stay. Albumin was 3.9 
indicating a true hypocalcemia. She was continued on calcitriol 
and calcium carbonate.

#HTN - The patients blood pressures were mainly in the 150s 
systolic. She had been on Labetalol 400mg TID prior to a 
previous admission which was switched to Metoprolol XL 25mg 
daily, lisinopril 2.5mg daily @ last admission ___. 
Simvastatin 20mg daily and ASA 81mg were also added at that time 
for cardio-protection, however the patient states that she was 
not taking her Metoprolol, Lisinopril, ASA or Simvastatin. The 
patient's blood pressure was discussed with her nephrologist, 
Dr. ___. Dr. ___ restarting her 
beta-blocker, but waiting to restart Lisinopril. The patient was 
started on Metoprolol succinate 12.5mg daily which was titrated 
up to Metoprolol succinate 25mg daily prior to discharge. 

# seizure disorder - The patient had no seizure activity during 
her hospitalization and was continued on her home dose of 
Keppra.

# depression - The patient's home medications were continued 
during her stay. She was seen by social work at her request for 
coping/support. The patient reports seeing a therapist on a 
regular basis which she plans to continue.
 
# hypothyroidism - The patient has a history of hypothyroidism 
and her TSH was found to be suppressed @ 0.15. This may have a 
role in her diarrhea, although her free T4 and total T4 were 
only minimally elevated. The patient's levothyroxine dose was 
decreased from 200mcg to 188mcg daily. She will need outpt 
follow up including repeat TFTs in 1 month.

# Asthma - The patient has a history of asthma and uses Advair 
at home. She was stable from a respiratory standpoint during her 
admission. She was continued on Advair. 

# CT findings - a 5cm right adnexal mass and new renal lesions 
were seen on CT scan incidentally. The patient will need outpt 
follow up of these findings.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting and 
abdominal pain. You had blood tests performed and a CT Scan that 
showed signs of pancreatitis. In the hospital you received 
intravenous fluids, pain control, and were asked not to eat or 
drink. While you were in the hospital you had an episode of high 
fevers that were likely due to your pancreatitis. No other 
source of infection or cause for your fevers was found. Your 
fevers resolved with tylenol and cooling packs. Your pain and 
nausea also improved and your diet was advanced slowly back to a 
regular diet.

While in the hospital you had dialysis for your kidney disease. 
You also had tests performed to evaluate possible causes of your 
diarrhea. No definite diagnosis was made. You should follow up 
with your gastroenterologist, Dr. ___ as scheduled for further 
work-up.

You were discharged home after 7 days in the hospital. On 
discharge, you did not have a fever, your pain had improved and 
you were eating a regular diet. An appointment was made for you 
to follow up with your primary care doctor. You will also see 
your nephrologist, Dr. ___, at dialysis and your 
gastroenterologist, Dr. ___, to further evaluate causes of 
your diarrhea.

Your thyroid stimulating hormone level was found to be low which 
means that you are HYPER-thyroid. This may have played a role in 
your diarrhea. Your LEVOTHYROXINE dose was decreased to 188 mcg 
daily.
You should follow up with your primary care doctor regarding 
your Levothyroxine.

The following changes were made in your medications:
LEVOTHYROXINE decreased to 188mcg daily.
START multivitamin
START tums
START metoprolol succinate 25mg daily

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has a history of hypertension, HCV cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She also has a history of chronic diarrhea, which has been ongoing for over six months. On admission, she was found to have mild tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, but no rebound or guarding. Laboratory results showed mildly elevated lipase and CT findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. She was treated conservatively for acute pancreatitis and her pain improved over the course of her stay. She was also found to have a suppressed TSH, which may be contributing to her diarrhea. At discharge, she was afebrile and her abdominal pain had improved. She was prescribed no further medications for pain control and was scheduled for outpatient follow-up with her gastroenterologist for further work-up."

Brief Hospital Course:
Key Information for Outside Providers: 
___ is a ___ year old female with history of ESRD on HD, 
peripheral vascular disease status post RLE BKA, admitted 
___ with sepsis secondary to MRSA bacteremia, now status 
post removal and replacement of her tunneled HD line able to be 
discharged home with planned course of vancomycin to be 
continued at HD

# MRSA Sepsis secondary to
# Acute blood stream infection 
# Suspected Acute bacterial Endocarditis 
# L lateral heel ulcer 
Patient with history of MRSA line infection ___ who 
presented with MRSA bacteremia presumed ___ line infection. 
Patient's TTE was concerning for possible vegetation on 
tricuspid valve.  She was seen by ID consult service who 
initially recommended TEE, but patient declined this and was 
able to verbalize her understanding.  Source of bacteremia felt 
to be line-related, although ID also recommended MRI of L heel, 
where she had an unhealed ulcer that was debrided by podiatry.  
Given need for IV contrast, patient declined study due to 
chronic risks associated with MRI contrast in patients who are 
ESRD.  Patient had HD catheter removed on ___, then had a 
line replaced on ___.  Patient treated with IV vancomcyin 
with clinical improvement.  Last positive blood cultures were 
drawn on ___. Because endocarditis and/or osteomyelitis 
could not be definitively ruled out, ID consult service 
recommended completion of 6-week course of Vancomycin, dosed at 
HD.  

# Difficult access 
___ initially tried to place a new line on the left side, to 
preserve the right-sided vasculature for a future AV graft. 
Unfortunately, a L IJ and L subclavian line was unable to be 
placed due to sclerosis and or thrombosis of the L IJ and L 
subclavian, likely secondary to multiple access attempts. The 
patient refused femoral access and was able to verbalize 
understanding of clinical situation.  Per discussion with Renal 
and ___, the decision was made to place R IJ line as above. 

# Behavioral Issues 
Patient often refused medications during this admission. In 
speaking to the patient, she believes that many medications 
make her sick. In speaking to her HCP, her brother ___ 
___, he reports that she often refuses medications at home as 
well.  Inpatient psychiatry consult team saw patient for 
assessment regarding capacity to make medical decisions 
relating to medications and inpatient managemetn.  She was felt 
to not pose a danger to herself, and in discussions with team 
was able to demonstrate understanding of her decisions and 
their impact on her health.  She was recommended for outpatient 
follow up with psychiatry and counseling. Of note, per review 
of prior records, does have history of concussion as child. 
Evaluated by Cognitive Neurology in ___. Found to have 
significantly low IQ and learning deficits, although masked by 
verbal fluency. Her ability to handle new and complex info is 
impaired.  During this admission extra time was spent 
counseling patient to ensure she understood clinical situation, 
team recommendations and risk/benefit as it related to her 
clinical state.

# Gastroparesis
Initial presentation notable for nausea and vomiting. No 
evidence of acute abnormality on CT A/P and abdominal exam 
reassuring.  Felt to represent gastroparesis flare.  Treated 
with supportive care with resolution of symptoms.  She was able 
to tolerate a regular diet. 

# ESRD: On HD TThSa. Pt declined sevelamer/nephrocaps as she 
reported they worsen her chronic symptoms of nausea. 

# Hyperphosphatemia: Pt declined phosphate binders this 
admission. 

# Mild Intermittent Asthma
Continued home flovent. 

# DM type 2
Held glipizide while inpatient, restarted upon discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

Why were you admitted to the hospital?
======================================
You were admitted to ___ because of fevers, chills, and 
vomiting caused by a bloodstream infection.

What did you receive in the hospital?
=====================================
You were treated with an intravenous antibiotic called 
vancomycin. We also removed your tunneled dialysis catheter, as 
we felt this was the cause of your infection. A temporary 
dialysis catheter was placed so that you could continue to 
receive dialysis while we treated your infection. This was 
eventually replaced with a permanent dialysis catheter.

You were seen by podiatry while you were here. They looked at 
the wound on your left heel, they cleaned the wound and provided 
us with recommendations to keep it clean. 

What should you do when you leave the hospital?
===============================================
Your discharge medications are as below. 
Your follow up appointments are as below. 
Please thinkg about getting further imaging for your foot and 
heart. They could be potential sources of infection and may be a 
reason why you keep getting blood stream infections. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Conclusions   
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is 
seen in the left atrial appendage. A small patent foramen ovale 
is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
to moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. 
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion. 

 Post Bypass: Patient is A paced on milrinone vasopressin and 
norepinepherine infusions. Thee are smooth contours in the 
aortic root consistent with a conduit. Laminar flow is seen in 
the aortic root and ascending aorta. The aortic valve appears to 
be native tissue and now has trace to mild central aortic 
insufficiency s/p resuspension. Peak aortic valve gradient 11, 
mean 5 mm Hg. Aortic valve pressure half time >800 ms. ___ 
contours otherwise intact after cannula removal. Remaining 
examination is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons

DIAGNOSTICS:
============
LEFT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___ccess. 90% Occlusion in mid and distal LAD, 2 DES 
placed with good revascularization. OMR documentation pending. 

TTE 
---
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There 
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild 
focal distal septal hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract 
normally (LVEF = 55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 
c/w CAD.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___.

What happened while you were in the hospital?
- You were admitted because of chest pain, sweating, and a 
clammy feeling 
- You were given sublingual nitroglycerin to decrease the amount 
of blood going to your heart to decrease the stress on your 
heart, this improved your chest pain significantly
- An EKG was done to monitor how your heart was beating, it 
showed some concerning changes
- A troponin level was checked; this is an enzyme that is 
released from your heart cells when your heart muscle is in 
danger. The troponin level was elevated which was concerning
- Your heart was monitored throughout your stay with a telemetry 
monitor, there were no concerning events
- You were started on aspirin, heparin, ticagrelor. These 
medications are blood thinners and are meant to improve blood 
circulation in your heart vessels 
- You were started on atorvastatin which helps decrease 
cholesterol and improve heart function 
- An echo/ultrasound was done to assess your heart function 
which showed your heart is functioning well 
- A catheterization of your heart vessels was done which showed 
significant occlusion in one vessel. Two drug eluding stents 
were placed and blood flow was restored 
- Your HbA1c was checked which is used to measure your average 
blood sugar over three months. The result was 6.5, normal is 
<5.7. For the past three months, your average blood sugar as 
been 140. You were started on a new medication to improve your 
blood sugar. Please recheck your HbA1c in three months to ensure 
improvement

What to do after discharge?
- Follow up with your cardiologist to ensure everything is going 
well
- Continue taking the medications as prescribed, this is very 
important. Your new drug eluding stent will get occluded if you 
miss as little as one dose
- Follow up with your primary care doctor for diabetic 
education, including nutrition education

- Your new medications include:
1. Aspirin 81mg daily (blood thinner- you will be on this 
medication indefinitely 
2. Ticagrelor 90mg every 12 hours (blood thinner- you will be on 
this medication for at least ___ year
3. Metformin 500mg every 12 hours for the first week, then 
increase your morning dose to 1000mg followed by 500mg 12 hours 
later (diabetes), initially this may cause nausea, diarrhea and 
stomach upset- you will be on this medication for at least 3 
months pending your next HbA1c
4. Atorvastatin 80 mg every night before bed, this is replacing 
your simvastatin 20mg- you will be on this medication 
indefinitely 
5. Metoprolol Succinate 50mg, this is replacing your Atenolol 50 
mg daily- you will be on this medication indefinitely
6. Nitroglycerin .3 sublingual up to 3 times as needed for chest 
pain, call your PCP or go to the ED immediately if the chest 
pain does not resolve 

We are happy to see you feeling better. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with chest pain. He has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, pre-diabetes, hemorrhoids/anal fissure, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. He presented with substernal chest pain that started in the morning while he was lying in bed, which was associated with sweating, feeling hot and clammy, and diaphoresis. The pain lasted for about an hour and was described as severe. He denied radiation of pain, numbness/tingling in his arms, shortness of breath, and abdominal/back pain.

The patient has a past medical history of cardiac risk factors, including pre-diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He also has a history of dermatoheliosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, inflammatory colon polyp, chronic sun-damaged skin, and seborrheic keratoses.

The patient's physical examination on admission showed a well-developed male in no acute distress, with a normal cardiovascular examination. His laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, with a peak level of 0.16 ng/mL. He was started on heparin gtt and aspirin.

The patient underwent a left heart catheterization, which showed 90% occlusion in the mid and distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and two drug-eluting stents were placed with good revascularization.

The patient's diagnosis is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, consistent with coronary artery disease. He was prescribed medications at discharge, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol."

consisting
of leftward eye deviation, eyelid fluttering, tongue biting,
foaming at the mouth. It lasted >15 minutes and was unable to be
aborted after a total of 4 mg of lorazepam, so he was intubated

===imaging/other data===

XR Abdomen ___:
There is no bowel obstruction or dilated bowel loops.  Moderate 
too severe 
amount of stool within the colon, and rectosigmoid, indicate 
constipation. 

XR hand ___:
No fracture or dislocation is seen.  Mild degenerative changes 
are seen 
involving the distal interphalangeal joints of the second and 
fifth finger as well as the proximal interphalangeal joints of 
the third fourth and fifth fingers.  No bone erosion or 
periostitis is identified. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic 
lesion is identified. No soft tissue calcification or 
radio-opaque foreign bodies are detected.

MRI/MRA Head and Neck ___:
loss FLAIR and diffuse atrophy. 
2. FLAIR hyperintense deep white matter and periventricular 
lesions are 
nonspecific, but likely represent sequela of chronic small 
vessel ischemic 
disease. 
3. Moderate to severe atherosclerotic narrowing at the origin of 
the internal carotid arteries, left greater than right.  No 
additional flow limiting stenosis, thrombosis, dissection or 
aneurysm greater than 3 mm. 
4. Cutaneous lesion at the right inferior occipital scalp 
suggestive of 
sebaceous cyst.

CT TORSO ___:
1. Findings suggestive of left pectoralis muscular injury/tear 
with evolving intramuscular hematoma.  Less likely 
considerations include myonecrosis or abscess. 
2. No evidence of acute fracture. 
3. Obstruction of lingular bronchi by mucous plugging.  Diffuse 
airway wall thickening compatible with bronchitis. 
4. Thickened and hyperemic bladder wall with diverticula 
suggestive of chronic outlet obstruction, perhaps from an 
enlarged prostate.  Correlation with urinalysis, however, is 
recommended to exclude active infection. 
5. Moderate diffuse colonic stool load with a large rectal stool 
ball. 
6. Small hiatal hernia.  Fluid-filled esophagus suggests 
esophageal 
dysmotility.  Enteric tube tip in stomach. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo M with history of intellectual disability, 
HTN, HLD, who presented to the hospital with facial bruising and 
had first time seizure in the ED >15 minutes, and required 
Ativan, keppra, and intubation with propofol drip to resolve. He 
was found to have a UTI which likely contributed to the seizure, 
and had decreased brain volume and atrophy on MRI which lowers 
seizure threshold. He will continue on keppra for seizure 
treatment. 

#Seizure/encephalopathy
The patient was admitted to the NeuroICU on midazolam gtt and 
fentanyl. No further seizure like activity was noted. He was 
continued on Keppra 500 mg BID. He was initially continued on 
broad spectrum coverage for meningoencephalitis, though 
antibacterials were discontinued with an LP showing 1 WBC. He 
was continued on acyclovir until HSV PCR negative on ___. 
MRI showed global brain atrophy, without acute lesions or other 
structural problems. EEG showed generalized slowing in the ___ 
hz range with no seizures or epileptiform dischages. He was 
weaned to extubate on hospital day 3. Urine culture from 
admission turned positive, showed >100k CFU EColi, he was 
started on ceftriaxone, however sensitivities showed CTX 
resistance, and he was switched to IV Unasyn on ___. He was 
discharged on augmentin 875mg BID for a total 10 day course 
(ends on ___.

#Hypotension
Home BP medications were held as he had SBP90s while intubated 
on sedating medications. His SBP ran in the 100-110 range after 
extubation, so home medications continued to be held.

# Constipation
On ___ he vomited dinner, and again vomited breakfast on ___. He 
had benign abdominal exam with KUB that showed large amount of 
stool. He received Miralax, bisacodyl, lactulose, milk of 
magnesia, and fleet enema x 2 and had multiple bowel movements. 
He was able to tolerate PO prior to discharge back to nursing 
facility. He was discharged on new medications for constipation.

# Pectoralis tear: CT chest showed an incidental finding of a 
left pectoralis muscular injury/tear with evolving intramuscular 
hematoma. Patient denied pain at that site and had full range of 
motion of the shoulder. Orthopedics was consulted who 
recommended nonoperative management with rest, ice, and pain 
control.

the details.   

Dr. ___ his history was consistent with epilepsy (focal,
probably temporal) and he was started on Keppra 500 mg BID at
that time (___). He also had a 48 hour ambulatory EGG which
showed ""bitemporal independent and  occasional bitemporal
synchronous slowing along with relatively infrequent 
bursts of more generalized but centrally predominant theta
activity. These  findings are relatively nonspecific and may
represent underlying multifocal  subcortical pathological
abnormalities, vascular disease or sequela of 
traumatic head injury. No seizure activity was acquired during
the recording sessions. No interictal epileptic activity was
noted.""

Since he saw Dr. ___ in ___, he reports full compliance with
his Keppra. He has not been sick recently and has had no 
interval
head trauma. He has trouble remembering the details of what
brought him to the hospital today but thinks it was because of
""brain farts"" which are his seizures. Unfortunately his family
cannot be reached as he cannot remember their numbers (but he
says he would not usually remember them). Mr. ___ thinks he
did not have any seizures up until his recent episode which
brought him to the hospital. He reports that he cannot remember
what happened but he thinks he had a seizure at church
(___). He does not remember the interval history but
reports that he feels back to his normal self. 

Review of limited ___ records indicate that his family
brought him to the hospital on ___ with concern for increased
seizure frequency. He reportedly was having staring episodes and
repeating himself for ___ days leading up to presentations. The
episodes were more frequently and lasting longer so they finally
took him to the hospital. At ___, he was having episodes of
staring into space and repeating himself. This was of unclear
duration. He was given Ativan 2 mg IV x1 and Keppra 1 g x1. WBC
7.1, Na 137, Cr 0.9, BG 110, LFTs normal, UA non-inflammatory,
Stox/Utox . unrevealing. He seemed to improve after the Ativan
and Keppra and was transferred to ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ y/o M with extensive vascular history who 
presented with chest pain and anemia. Transferred to MICU due to 
concern of demand ischemia in setting of LGIB.  

#Chest Pain - The patient has an extensive coronary history. His 
present episode of chest pain ocurred in the setting of 
tachycardia to the 160s (reported by EMS) and a hematocrit below 
his baseline. Given pt's EKG and clinical picture, the elevated 
troponin was most likely demand ischemia. He was given packed 
RBCs to increase oxygen supply for increased demand.   A CHF 
exacerbation despite an elevated BNP, but unclear likely given 
clear lungs and no fluid overload on CXR.  Other etiologies 
including PE was considered but his INR was supratherepeutic and 
pt was not hypoxic. Cardiology was consulted and did not believe 
that this was ACS and did not recommend coronary angiography.

# Anemia - The patient has a long history of anemia and has 
known history of gastric erosions, but no ulcers, and 
diverticuli. CT Abdomen this month has no evidence of 
malignancy. Pt is presently on iron supplementation. Guaiac (+) 
stool in ED and on the floor. Pt was transfused several units of 
RBCs (followed by lasix) to maintain a goal of hct>30 for demand 
ischemia. 
 
# A. Fib - CHADS2 score of 4. The patient presented in afib with 
a rate in the 110s, and hemodynamically stable. Pt may have had 
an episode of NSVT with EMS before arriving to ED since he had 
SVT during last admission. No SVT episodes during ICU course. Pt 
was continued on metoprolol with rates maintained below 100, 
until the patient developed the GI bleed.  Metoprolol was held 
given blood pressures in 90/50 and his heart rate was well 
controlled without it.  Given his GI bleed, his coumadin and 
metoprolol were held at the time of discharge.

#. C.diff colitis- The patient was found to have C. diff colitis 
and started on metronidazole on ___.  He will need to 
complete 14 days of metronidazole.
 
# PVD - Patient with PVD leading to ulcerations. Patient with 
stent placed recently and it was of high priority that he 
continued anti-platelet and AC with plavix and warfarin at 
present. With pt's GI bleed, vascular team was amenable to 
discontinuing Plavix. Wound care team followed pt throughout 
course.

# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease - Cr elevated to 2.0 on 
admission. Also with BUN elevation to suggest pre-renal state. 
___ also be due to renal vein congestion in the setting of CHF. 
After receiving blood products, his Cr improved and was 1.4 at 
the time of discharge.

# sCHF/CAD - Worsening EF thought to be due to progressive CAD. 
It was imperative to give blood/fluid slowly and diurese as 
needed. CXR and lungs presently clear with absent JVD on my 
exam. Pt's home torsemide was held.  The statin and ACE 
inhibitor were restarted by the time of discharge.  The patient 
should follow up with his cardiology within ___ weeks after 
discharge to assess the need to restart his torsemide.
 
# Delirium - Had difficulty with sundowning on prior admission. 
Seen by ___ consult and was started on zyprexa PRN agitation at 
night.

# DMII: Pt's home metformin was hekd and BG were monitored four 
times a day.  He was discharge on an Insulin sliding scale.

Transitional issues:
- Reassesment regarding restarting Coumadin, metoprolol and 
torsemide
- F/u with his PCP ___ 1 week of discharge from rehab
- F/u with his cardiology within ___ weeks of discharge from the 
hospital

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for 
chest pain.  We don't believe you had a heart attack, but the 
chest pain was likely related to lower oxygen to your heart.  
You are now chest pain free after receiving blood.  

We also found that you had a bleed within your gastrointestional 
system.  You underwent endoscopy, in otherword we looked with a 
camera at your gastrointestion system, which did not find the 
source of your bleeding.  We have stopped your plavix and 
currently stopping your coumadin after discharge.  We have also 
stopped your torsemide and metoprolol given lower blood 
pressure.  You should follow up with your cardiology and 
determine if you should restart the torsemide, metoprolol, and 
coumadin.  

We also found that you had an infection of your colon caused by 
a bacteria, clostridium difficle.  You will need to take 
antibiotics to treat this infection.

Finally, it is important that you rebuild your strength after 
discharge at the rehab extended care facility.

We are stopping your torsemide and metoprolol given your recent 
GI bleed.  Please talk with your cardiology about restarting 
metoprolol, torsemide and coumadin within ___ weeks of 
discharge.  Also, please see your primary care doctor within 1 
week of discharge from rehab.

he only drank listerine, and no other drugs.  Initial vitals 
were 99.1 100 144/78 20 100%. 

.

Plan was for CIWA and observation until sober re-evaluation.  
However after several hours in observation he began to withdraw 
and score on CIWA for tremulousness and tachycardia.  Given his 
seizure history and requirement of 6mg Ativan over an hour he 
was transferred to the ___.

.

 

On arrival here, he is alert, interactive and asking for pain 
meds

.

Of note Mr ___ has had multiple recent admissions as 
follows:

- ___ ICU w/ d/c AMA on ___ for presumed isopropyl alcohol 
intoxication and admission from ___ to ___ for presumed 
aspiration pneumonia on cefpodoxime/azithromycin 

- ___ ___ for fevers, CP, and productive cough cough.  

.  

- ___ ICU from ___ to ___. Patient was visiting his wife 
___ in the ICU when he was noted to become unresponsive.

- Durring his hospitalization ___ he called his ___ PCP and 
complained of not getting enough pain meds, he then told his PCP 
___ ""if he didnt give him more pain meds he would put him in as 
much pain as he (___) was already in.""  This resulted in the 
patient being banned from ___ clinic, patient relations 
involvement and an agreement by which Mr. ___ is not 
allowed to get any outpatient prescriptions from ___.

counterparts.

.

Listerine Ingestion: 

Per the ingredient list Listerine is 40% etoh and also includes 
a salicylate.  Mr ___ ETOH level on admission to the ICU 
was 85 while his salicylate level was negative.  It is likely 
that ETOH was driving all of his assorted issues.  This likely 
explained his lowish anion gap metabolic acidosis on admission.  
Using the formula that ETOH is corrected for in the osmolar gap 
by dividing by 3.8, his osmolar gap is accounted for by his ETOH 
level, making coingestion with isopropanol or ethylene glycol 
much less likely.  He scored only once on CIWA, over 18 hours 
ago, and currently has normal vital signs.  We will plan for 
discharge. 

- Per prior agreement he will not be discharged with 
prescriptions for any medications
.
Hypoxia:
Suspect medication induced hypoventilion c/b splinting leading 
to increased CO2 and thus increased CO2 admixture via the 
alveolar gas equation, stably in the low 90's overnight while 
asleep. Resolved morning of discharge.
.
Pain control:
This patient is a terrible candidate for opiates, and refuses 
nsaids, we used low dose tylenol and would not give opiates in 
any situation if possible.  Despite sleeping easily, he 
continued to request fioricet/fioranol for his migraines when he 
awakened, but this medication was not in his medication discarge 
list.  He was given tylenol.
.
Rib Pain:
No hct drop to raise c/f splenic rupture, no fractured ribs, no 
ptx
.
Multiple Psychiatric diagnoses:
Patient was continued on his home regimen, he should continue 
with his home supply at home.
.
?Seizure d/o history:
.
Doctor ___ recent note calls into question his seizure 
history; however, the patient comes in with a positive 
barbiturate level.   Given his lack of seizure disorders and 
previous plans, we will discharge him without a prescription for 
phenobarb.

.

Dicharge planning:

Please refer to the below note from Chief Resident ___ 
regarding his rules for discharge.
.  
"" After discussion with the patient and his consulting services, 
we will not provide prescriptions for any of his reported home 
medication including clonazepam, carbamazepine, amitriptyline, 
olanzapine or mirtazapine. At this time, the risk of significant 
toxicity including death, in the setting of his ongoing 
substance abuse is greater the risk of any potential withdrawal 
symptoms.
.
After discussion with neurology we will provide the patient with 
a short duration of phenobarbital with planned Neurology Access 
Clinic follow up.""

-----------
IMAGING:
-----------
CTA Head ___:
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD: 
The CT angiography of the head demonstrates normal flow in the 
distal cervical internal carotid arteries with marked narrowing 
of both supraclinoid internal carotid arteries with diminished 
flow in the both MCA trunks. Flow is visualized normally in the 
anterior cerebral arteries as well as somewhat diminished flow 
is seen in the posterior circulation. Vascular structures are 
attenuated and it is difficult to evaluate for an aneurysm. 
Extensive collateral vascular structures are seen in the region 
of basal ganglia bilaterally. The superior sagittal and 
transverse sinuses are patent. The vein ___ and ___ 
sinus are also patent. The anterior portions of both internal 
cerebral veins are not well visualized, which could be secondary 
to blood within the third ventricle and focal mass effect.  
IMPRESSION:
1. Head CT shows intraventricular hemorrhage with dilated 
lateral ventricles due to hydrocephalus.
2. CT angiography of the head demonstrates attenuated internal 
carotid
arteries and middle cerebral arteries with collateral 
lenticulostriate
arteries indicative of a moyamoya pattern which could be 
secondary to
vasculitis. The arterial structures are quite attenuated for 
evaluation of
aneurysm, although none is obviously present. Further evaluation 
with
cerebral angiography is recommended. Although no obvious 
aneurysm or
arteriovenous malformation is seen but the conventional 
angiography can
provide better information of the arterial structures.

CT Head ___:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval decrease in the 
amount of
hyperdense blood in the left lateral ventricle and third 
ventricle and fourth ventricle. There has been decrease in 
amount of hydrocephalus in the interval since ___. 
The suprasellar cistern is patent. The basal cisterns are 
slightly narrowed; however, visualized. This demonstrates 
improvement since ___, where the basal cisterns 
were obliterated. A focal area of hypodensity in the right basal 
ganglia (2:11) is noted. Linear hyperdensity in the sulci of the 
left frontoparietal region (2:17) may represent a component of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Bilateral ventricular shunts from a 
frontal approach are stable in place. There has been interval 
resolution of previously seen pneumocephalus. There is minimal 
subcutaneous gas (2:26). There is no sclerotic or lytic bony 
lesion to suggest malignancy. Minimal mucosal thickening in the 
posterior right ethmoid air cells are noted. 
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in intraventricular hyperdense hemorrhage 
and interval
decrease in hydrocephalus and mass effect with interval 
visualization of the basal cisterns, which were obliterated on 
prior exam.
2. Focal hypodensity in the right basal ganglia may represent a 
focal area of infarction. This was not seen on prior exam.

MRI ___
IMPRESSION: Right intraventricular hemorrhage as on the previous 
CT.  
Acute/subacute right periatrial white matter infarct as seen on 
the previous CT examination. Signal changes in the right basal 
ganglia could be due to subacute/chronic hemorrhage. Increased 
signal in the right side of the midbrain probably due to 
subacute or chronic infarct in this location. No other acute 
infarct seen. Other findings as above. 

MRA OF HEAD: ___
Head MRA demonstrates bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid 
artery flow 
signal narrowing indicative of occlusive disease. The middle 
cerebral 
arteries are not fully visualized. Similar findings were seen on 
the previous CTA examination. In the posterior circulation, 
basilar artery is well visualized but diminished flow signal is 
seen in both posterior cerebral arteries. 
IMPRESSION: The MRA appearance has not significantly changed 
since the 
previous CTA examination. Diminished flow is seen in both middle 
cerebral 
arteries secondary to supraclinoid occlusive disease. 

U/S abdomen:
___
IMPRESSION: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound without 
evidence of 
cholecystitis or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation. 
  
CT HEAD ___: s/p removal of EVDs
IMPRESSION: 
1. Stable appearance of right ventricular hemorrhage, with blood 
products 
layering dependently in the occipital horn of the right lateral 
ventricle. No new hemorrhage. 
2. Stable ventricular size.

EEG: ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to wide and 
sudden 
fluctuations between theta frequency slowing and higher voltage 
rhythmic 
delta frequency slowing. At least one of these periods of delta 
slowing 
seemed to respond to stimulation suggesting that it might be 
related to 
level of alertness. This level of slowing could also, however, 
be 
metabolic or due to other encephalopathies. There were no 
epileptiform 
features on this recording. 

___: LENIs performed for ___ pain and showed: no evidence of 
DVTs

 
Brief Hospital Course:
**The patient underwent emergent bilateral EVD placement in the 
Emergency Department and was then admitted to Neurosurgery. 
Following successful placement, she was transferred to the ICU 
for close monitoring and Q1 neuro checks. A cerebral angio 
performed that evening confirmed the presence ___. She 
was put on mannitol 25g Q6 for edema, which was weaned down on 
___ to 12.5mg Q6 and has subsequently been weaned off. The EVDs 
were kept patent with TPA flushing.  

**On ___ her EVD's were raised to 20 and on ___ her Left EVD was 
clamped and her Head CT was stable.  Overnight on ___ into ___ 
she was febrile and became more lethargic.  Her L EVD was 
subsequently opened on ___ and a Head CT was done which showed 
unchanged IVH and slowly evolving subacute R basal ganglia and 
superior parietal lobe infarcts.  

**On ___ she continued to be febrile and her L EVD was again 
clamped with her R continuing to be open at 20.  On ___ her 
exam began to improve as she was oriented to self and that she 
was in the hopsital.  Her Left EVD was removed and her Right was 
rasied to 25.  CSF was also sent for studies.

**On ___ patient's EVD was clamped for a trial. Patient's ICPs 
overnight ranged from ___. She was also being transitioned to 
Keprra for antiseizure coverage due to elevated LFTs. A speech 
and swallow evaluation was declined because of patient's 
lethargy. A PEG was placed on ___ without complications and 
patient will remained NPO  until ___. Her exam is stable, EVD 
was removed and CSF cultures were sent. 

**On ___ patient was lethargic, arousable only with constant 
noxious stimuli. Patient making eye contact and spontaneous with 
RUE, but no commands or mouthing of words. Head CT showed more 
prominent ventricles, but no hydrocephalus.

Please attend all followup appointments as listed below. 

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
WOUND CARE
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and 
report any of the following problems to your physician. 
Keep your incision clean and dry.
You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo 24 hours after your 
sutures are removed.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your 
incision.   
DO NOT DRIVE until you are seen at the first follow up 
appointment.
Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your 
physician.

DIET
Usually no special diet is prescribed after this procedure. A 
normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you 
should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating 
before your surgery. 

MEDICATIONS
Take all of your medications as ordered.  You do not have to 
take pain medication unless it is needed.  It is important that 
you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough 
to walk.   
Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication. 
Medications that may be prescribed include: 
oNarcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone).  
oAn over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or 
Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as 
Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or 
Fleets enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and 
anesthesia can cause constipation.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and 
Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding. 

ACTIVITY
The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired 
or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger 
every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take 
to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself 
again. In general:
Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor 
and therapist.
Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you 
are feeling good.
You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing 
activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and 
begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
DO NOT DRIVE until you speak with your physician.
Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your 
physician.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and 
push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy 
objects, or straining at stool.
   Do your breathing exercises every two hours.  
   Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour, that you 
are awake.  

WHEN TO CALL YOUR SURGEON:

Discharge Instructions:
It has been a privilege to take care of you ___ 
___.
.
You were hospitalized because your heart was beating very slowly 
because of an abnormality in the electrical wiring system of 
your heart; you have a condition known as complete heart block.
.
You underwent an emergency procedure to implant a pacemaker into 
your chest that provides your heart with a regular electrical 
current to ensure that it beats at the correct rhythm. You 
tolerated the procedure well and the pacemaker is functioning 
correctly. This pacemaker will hopefully help to prevent 
recurrence of the fatigue that you have been experiencing.
.
You should avoid raising your arms above your head, and should 
also avoid heavy lifting, for the next several weeks.  Do not 
remove the steri-strips over the site where the pacemaker was 
placed.

Implantation of a pacemaker is surgical procedure, which is why 
you will require antibiotics to prevent infections. The 
following is your antibiotic regimen:
# START: Clindamycin 300 mg every 6h for 1 day
.
Otherwise, your heart regimen is unchanged. Your current heart 
regimen is the following:
# CONTINUE: Torsemide 60 mg twice daily
# CONTINUE: Lisinopril 10 mg daily
# CONTINUE: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual tablet as needed for 
CP
**Take up to 3 tablets 5 minutes apart then call ___ if pain 
does not resolve.**
# CONTINUE: Cholestyramine 4 gram packet daily
# CONTINUE: Ezetimibe 10 mg daily
.
We decreased the dose of your Gabapentin to 300mg daily. This 
dose is based on your kidney function levels.  You can discuss 
the dosing with your primary care doctor next week.

Please continue to take all of your other medications as 
previously prescribed. 
.
Please attend the follow-up appointments detailed below.
 
Followup Instructions:

STUDIES:
TTE ___: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a 
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally 
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve 
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular 
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is borderline 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the 
left ventricular ejection fraction is increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ F with h/o NSTEMI in ___ s/p cardiac 
catheterization (50% mid-LAD stenosis and 90% RCA stenosis with 
collaterals) without PCI who is transferred from ___ 
___ for cardiac catheterization after presenting with chest 
pain and shortness of breath on exertion, found to have 2 vessel 
dx w/ thrombus in ramus s/p POBA and occluded LCx w/ thrombus 
s/p DES, c/b bradycardia/hypotension requiring pressors/IABP, 
now resolved. 
  
# CAD: Presentation c/w unstable angina, likely explains DOE, 
was found on cardiac catheterization to have LCx/ramus thrombus 
and diffuse RCA disease, s/p POBA to ramus and DES to LCx. 
Procedure was complicated by vagal response requiring 
pressors/atropine/IABP. She was monitored in the CCU overnight 
and then transferred to the floor. At discharge she was 
hemodynamically stable. Her troponin leak was trended to peak 
and was felt to be consistent with post-procedure changes, given 
stable EKG and lack of suggestive symptoms. Her home aspirin was 
continued. She was loaded with Plavix and will require daily 
dual antiplatelet therapy for the next year. Atorvastatin 80mg 
QD was continued. She was started on Carvedilol 3.125 mg BID 
(there was concern that she had some bronchospasm at a higher 
dose, but tolerated this dose well) and her diltiazem was 
discontinued. Her Losartan was switched to Valsartan 160mg QD 
(better outcomes in heart failure). 
 
# Acute on Chronic diastolic heart failure: Likely ischemic 
cardiomyopathy. Appears to have mild systolic/diastolic dysfxn 
per TTE ___, LVEF was 50-55% and there was suggestion of 
impaired filling.   Repeat TTE on ___ showed LVEF 65%, mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired relaxation and 
borderline pulm systolic HTN, minimal aortic valve stenosis. She 
appeared euvolemic on exam. Her home lasix was continued. Her 
Losartan was switched to Valsartan 160mg QD (better outcomes in 
heart failure). 
She was maintained on a 2g Na restriction. As above, she was 
switched from diltiazem to Carvedilol.   

# ___: Carries a diagnosis of stage IV CKD, atrophic kidney, 
baseline proteinuria. At ___ her Cr was elevated to 1.4 on 
admission. This trended down, though she did receive >200 cc's 
of contrast at cath. At discharge her Cr was 1.1.
 
# pAF She carries a history of pAF, but is not on 
anticoagulation due to apparent fall risk. CHADS2 is 6 so very 
high risk for stroke. She was monitored on telemetry and was in 
sinus rhythm. As above, she was started on dual antiplatelet 
therapy which she will require for the next year re. DES. 
Anticoagulation should be considered as an outpatient if felt to 
be safe re. fall risk given high stroke risk.     

# Hypertension : BP was reportedly in 180s sytolic at ___ 
___. They were elevated during this admission as well. Her 
BP regimen was adjusted for more optimal control in the setting 
of coronary disease, to carvedilol and Valsartan, as above. BPs 
at discharge was improved to the systolics 140-160s (baseline 
prior to hospitalization had been SBPs in 160-200s).  
 
# S/p TIA: Continued home ASA 325mg, statin daily.  

# NIDDM: Home Januvia was held in favor of gentle Humalog 
insulin SS. At discharge her homes med was restarted.  

# Hyperlipidemia: Home atorvastatin was continued.  
 
# COPD: Continued on albuterol-ipatroprium, Advair (replacement 
for symbicort)
 
# Gout: Continued home allopurinol  
 
# GERD: Continued home ranitidine

TRANSITION ISSUES:
- Started on dual antiplatelet therapy (ASA/Plavix) given new 
DES. Will require full dose aspirin for one month post-cath and 
Plavix for one year.
- ___ benefit from warfarin at some point in the future if the 
bleeding risk of triple therapy is felt to be acceptable given 
high risk of stroke (CHADS2=6)
- New BP regimen: Carvedilol and Valsartan (Losartan and 
amlodipine were discontinued).  Patient will need BP check at 
PCP ___ discharge and further BP management.

admission due to recent spells of dizziness and ambulatory EEG
findings concerning for left temporal seizures. She states that
she noticed around ___ that she was having episodes that 
she
describes as feeling dizzy and ""in a fog"" that were associated
with nausea and vomiting. She then would have bilateral leg
weakness that prevented her from walking. She states that these
episodes would last on the order of seconds to minutes and would
then resolve. She did not have any more of these events in the
last few months until last week when she said she had another
episode of dizziness.

Her seizures in the past were generalized tonic clonic seizures
which would last on the order of seconds to minutes. She had a
right temporal lobectomy and pathology revealed an
oligodendroglioma. She said that following the surgery she had
only one GTC seizure and then was well-controlled. She has had
seizures since that time that she describes as crying spells. 
She
was started on Lamictal.  In the past, she has been treated with
multiple AEDs, including Mysoline, Dilantin, and Tegretol.  More

EEG 
___: This telemetry captured no pushbutton 
activations. Routine 
sampling showed a normal background in wakefulness and in sleep. 
There 
were frequent bursts of left temporal theta slowing, many with 
sharp 
features, but without clear epileptiform discharges. There were 
no 
electrographic seizures. 

___: This telemetry caputed a single pushbutton activation 
that 
was not associated with a change in the EEG recording. Routine 
sampling 
showed rhythmic and sharply contoured activity at times 
particularly 
in the left temporal region, however no clearly epileptiform 
discharges 
were noted in this recording. Note is made of an irregular heart 

rhythm. 

___: This telemetry captured a single pushbutton activation 
that 
was not associated with a change in the EEG recording. Routine 
sampling 
showed focal left hemispheric slowing, which could be sharply 
contoured, 
however there were no clearly epileptiform discharges. No 
electrographic 
seizures were noted. Note is made of an irregular heart rhythm 

___: This telemetry captured four pushbutton activation for 
brief 
body twitches, which were not associated with a change in EEG 
recording. 
Routine sampling showed left hemispheric focal slowing with 
rhythmic 
left temporal slowing at times but no epileptiform features were 
seen. 
No electrographic seizures were recorded. Note is made of an 
irregular 
heart rate. 

___: No pushbutton activations were captured during this 
recording. Routine sampling showed mild intermittent left 
hemispheric 
focal slowing most prominent over the posterior quadrant with a 
few 
broad left temporal sharp waves. No electrographic seizures were 

captured. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ yo RHW with a history of a R temporal 
lobectomy and refractory epilepsy who presents as an LTM 
admission for characterization of events after ambulatory EEG 
revealed epileptiform activity over the left temporal lobe. 
She has been having events which she describes as dizzy spells 
with
some leg weakness. These were clustering in ___ and she has 
not had any events in the past several weeks. Given the concern 
that these represented a new seizure type, the patient was 
admitted for longterm continuous video EEG monitoring.

The patient was slowly tapered off of Lamictal. She had a few 
pushbuttons for body twitching that had no EEG correlate, 
however she did not have any of the typical dizzy spells. She 
also did not have any crying spells, which had been a prior 
seizure semiology for her. Her EEG showed rhythmic slowing with 
sharp features in the L hemisphere, but no frank epileptiform 
discharges or seizures. 
The patient was therefore restarted on her Lamictal at a reduced 
dose of 300mg BID. She was also started on Vimpat and titrated 
up to 100 mg BID by discharge. She will remain on his dose until 
follow up with Dr. ___ on ___. 

The patient was monitored on cardiac telemetry and remained in 
atrial fibrillation with no pauses, rapid rates, or other 
arrhythmias. She was continued on atenolol, digoxin and ASA.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for video EEG monitoring to try to determine 
if your dizzy spells represented seizures. You were monitored 
and tapered off of your seizure medication, but did not have any 
seizures. You were started on a new seizure medication called 
Vimpat. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 44-year-old female who presents to the neurology service with a chief complaint of dizzy spells. She has a history of refractory epilepsy and a prior right temporal lobectomy due to an oligodendroglioma. She has been experiencing episodes of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, followed by bilateral leg weakness, which have been occurring for several months. Her past medical history includes epilepsy, atrial fibrillation, iron deficiency anemia, depression, GERD, and ADHD. She has been treated with multiple antiepileptic drugs, including Lamictal, which was tapered off during her hospital stay. The patient's physical examination is normal, with the exception of an irregular heart rhythm. Her neurologic examination reveals normal cognitive function, with no deficits in sensation, motor function, or coordination. The patient's EEG monitoring showed frequent bursts of left temporal theta slowing, but no electrographic seizures. She was admitted for long-term continuous video EEG monitoring to characterize her events and determine the cause of her symptoms."

STUDIES:
___ EKG: Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality. P-R 
interval prolongation. Left axis deviation. Left anterior 
fascicular block. Right bundle-branch block. Precordial Q waves. 
Consider anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Since the previous 
tracing of ___ atrial premature beat is now not seen. 
Otherwise, findings are unchanged. 

___ CT SPINE: 
1. ___ fracture or prevertebral soft tissue swelling. 
2. Multilevel degenerative changes including moderate central 
spinal canal 
narrowing at C3-C4. Canal stenosis predisposes to spinal cord 
injury in the setting of trauma and an MRI is recommended if 
there is concern for cord or ligamentous injury. 
3. New layering left pleural effusion. 

___ CT HEAD: ___ acute intracranial process.

___ CXR: Findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia with 
probable 
bilateral pleural effusions. Please note a moderate pleural 
effusion with 
seen on the left on CT C-spine from earlier today. 

___ CT CHEST (NON CON): 1. Unexplained bilateral nonhemorrhagic 
pleural effusion of uncertain chronicity, moderate on the left, 
small on the right. Pleural surfaces not fully evaluated.  2. 
Small areas of likely pneumonia, right middle lobe, do not 
explain the left predominate pleural effusion.  3. Heavy 
atherosclerotic coronary calcification. Mild global cardiomegaly 
including possible mild pulmonary hypertension.  4. Chronic 
incompletely healed left lower rib fractures. 

___ CT HEAD: ___ evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or other 
acute pathology.

___ Echo: Extremely suboptimal windows. The left atrium is 
elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is ___ pericardial 
effusion. The right ventricle was not visualized.  

___ EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch 
block with possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Left anterior 
fascicular block. Non-diagnostic Q waves in leads V1-V3. 
Non-specific ST segment changes in inferolateral leads in the 
setting of diffuse baseline artifact. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___ baseline artifact is now present confounding 
the interpretation of ST segments. 

___ CXR: Overall worsening of multifocal opacities likely 
multifocal
pneumonia. Increased left and persistent small right pleural 
effusions.

___ Video swallow: There is aspiration and penetration with 
nectar-thin liquids. There is spillover into the vallecula seen 
with all consistencies of liquids. For further details, please 
refer to speech and swallow division note in OMR. IMPRESSION: 1. 
Penetration and aspiration seen with nectar-thick liquids.

___ CXR:  There is a new moderate right-sided layering pleural 
effusion. A
left-sided layering pleural effusion appears mild-to-moderate in 
size and
likely unchanged, allowing for differences in technique. 
Increased
opacification is noted throughout the right lung with a 
heterogeneous pattern.  There are also associated left lower 
lung opacities, but similar. There is ___ pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: Worsening generalized right lung opacification, 
suggesting worsening of multifocal pneumonia including a new 
right-sided pleural effusion.

___ pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.  Reactive 
mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, histocytes, and neutrophils.

___ CXR: Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than 
right, has decreased substantially on the right following 
thoracentesis. ___ pneumothorax. Region of heterogeneous 
peribronchial opacification in the right mid lung could be 
pneumonia. There is ___ pulmonary edema. The heart is top normal 
size, mediastinal veins mildly dilated.

___ pleural fluid pending

___ video swallow: The study was conducted in collaboration with
speech pathology. Thin, nectar, and puree consistency were 
administered by
mouth. The examination is very limited secondary to the patient 
releasing
boluses out of the oral cavity. There is premature spill to the 
valleculae.
There was ___ penetration or aspiration seen with a very small 
quantity of thin and nectar consistency consumed. Puree was not 
swallowed. There is a
moderate amount of residue in the valleculae. There is a small 
amount of
residue in the piriform sinuses. IMPRESSION: Exam limited as 
described above. ___ aspiration seen. Moderate residue in the 
valleculae.

___ CXR: An AP upright view of the chest was obtained. There has 
been
marked interval reduction in the left pleural effusion without 
definite
residual pleural fluid identified. A moderate right pleural 
effusion is
largely unchanged as is right basilar airspace opacification 
likely
representing atelectasis. Right upper lobe parenchymal opacities 
and air
bronchograms are more prominent on the current study, possibly 
reflecting
worsening infection. The left lung is clear. ___ pneumothorax is 
identified.
___ osseous abnormalities are noted.  IMPRESSION: 1. Resolution 
of left pleural effusion status post thoracentesis. ___ 
pneumothorax identified.
2. Stable moderate right pleural effusion and right basilar 
airspace opacity likely representing atelectasis.  3. Worsening 
parenchymal opacity and air bronchograms within the right upper 
lobe, potentially representing progression of infection. 
Clinical correlation is recommended.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with history of hypertension, CAD s/p DES to LCx 
(___), dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and chronic renal 
insufficiency who presented from home s/p fall with leukocytosis 
and multifocal infiltrates on CXR found to have aspiration 
pneumonia and severe dysphagia.  
.
#Fall: Patient fell without any prodromal symptoms and ___ 
post-ictal state.  History was most consistent with mechanical 
fall and patient with history of rare falls in past.  ___ 
evidence of ischemic changes or arrhythmia on EKG.  Last echo in 
___ with ___ systolic dysfunction or obstructive pathology.  He 
was not orthostatic on evaluation.   
.  
#Delirium: Patient presented from home after a fall and 
developed delirium while hospitalized.  His delirium was 
initially complicated by severe agitation requiring a 1:1 aide 
___, two point restraints, and occasional anti-psychotics to 
calm him when he became a safety threat. Delirium attributed to 
hospitalization, NSTEMI and pneumonia. Attempted to re-orient 
patient and normalize sleep wake cycle with good success.  His 
delirium was predominantly hypoactive during the last week of 
his admission.  
.
#Dysphagia:  His dysphagia was a chronic problem that was 
acutely worsened by his fall and subsequent delirium.  
Swallowing function extremely poor on video swallow, and he 
continued to aspirate daily.  He was kept NPO on aspiration 
precautions with nutrition via PPN in the hope that his delirium 
would clear and he would regain his strength to swallow back at 
baseline.  He had a repeat video swallow which revealed 
persistent poor swallowing function.  The family decided that 
regardless of the aspiration risk, Dr. ___ want to eat 
and would assume the risk.  They chose a modified diet in order 
to slightly lessen a large aspiration risk.
.
#Pneumonia: Patient with significant leukocytosis with 
neutrophilia and ___ localizing symptoms on admission. Initial 
CXR with multifocal opacities and left pleural effusion 
concerning for pneumonia but ___ new cough, SOB, or fevers at 
home. ___ recent hospitalizations. Received a dose of 
levofloxacin in the ED. Levofloxacin was discontinued as it was 
not felt that patient had a clinical pneumonia, but more likely 
an asiration pneumonitis (white count normalized overnight). 
However, when patient developed a new oxygen requirement in the 
setting of delirium concern for a developing infectious process 
increased and he was started on vanco/CTX/flagly to cover HCAP 
and aspiration pneumonia. Patient triggered several times for 
hypoxia which was felt secondary to poor clearance of secretions 
and mucus plugging. He received chest ___, mucomyst nebs, 
oropharynx suctioning, and humidified supplemental oxygen.  He 
continued to aspirate during his hospital course with transient 
desaturations.
.
#Pleural effusions: His course was also complicated by pleural 
effusions necessitating right thoracentesis of 900 cc on ___ and 
left thoracentesis of 1.4 L on ___.  Pleural fluid cytology was 
negative for malignant cells. 
.  
#NSTEMI: Patient with history of CAD s/p DES to left cx in ___ 
for 70% lesion. Reported a single episode of chest pain the 
night prior to admission which was short lived and self 
resolved. Reported that he typically gets it once a week. 
Troponins were initially checked and elevated - attributed to 
underlying chronic renal insufficiency. CK/MB flat. In the 
setting patient's acute change in mental status another set of 
enzymes were checked and these ended up initially peaking 
(troponin at 0.50, CKMB 25). Cardiology was consulted and felt 
patient's symptoms were most likely related to demand ischemia 
in the setting of underlying pulmonary pathology and agitation. 
He was given aspirin (PO or PR) but further anticoagulation was 
not started. Echocardiogram was of poor quality but show ___ 
major wall motion abnormalities.  Statin was transiently held 
given patient's aspiration risk and NPO status.  Troponin was 
found to continue to rise to 1.28 ___K-MB and CK 
confirming prior event.
.  
#Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 1.7. 
Patient trended down to 1.4 during hospitalization as he was 
given PPN and IV fluids. 
.  
#Hypertension: Intermittently hypertensive when agitated.  He 
was continued on home lisinopril when taking POs. 
.
#Enterococcus in Urine: Bland UA but enterococcus (10K-100K) on 
culture. This was felt to be a sign of colonization rather than 
acute infection and thus patient was not treated for UTI. 
.  
#BPH: ___ active issues. Continued home finasteride.   
.  
#Anemia: Chronic in nature. Patient at baseline. ___ signs of 
active bleeding.   
.  
#Osteoporosis: He was followed by Dr. ___ was on 
Actonel as an outpatient. Next BMD scan was due on ___.  ___ 
fractures on CT head or spine, so he was continued outpatient 
calcium and vitamin D.
.
#Code Status: The patient was full code at the beginning of his 
admission, however, his HCP changed it to DNR/DNI prior to the 
end of his admission.  We had a series of family meetings during 
this admission.  This decision was made in accordance with what 
his wife deemed his goals of care: to be home and to avoid tubes 
and drains.  He was discharged home and the family chose to 
enroll him in hospice care.  He was discharged on a modified 
diet and his family understood that he had a 100% chance of 
repeat aspiration, and that it was impossible to predict when he 
would have a significant aspiration.  They signed the DNR/DNI 
forms, and will call the hospice nurse should he have a 
recurrent event.

Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 91-year-old male who presented to the emergency department after falling at home. He reported a mild episode of chest tightness the previous night, which he attributed to gas pain. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. On admission, his physical examination revealed a small abrasion on his head, poor inspiratory effort, and decreased breath sounds in his left lung base. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis, and a chest X-ray was concerning for multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient underwent thoracentesis on two occasions and was prescribed levofloxacin and tetanus vaccination. He was also given 1 liter of normal saline and had a CT scan of his spine, which showed moderate central spinal canal narrowing at C3-C4. He was discharged with a diagnosis of pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's medications at discharge included levofloxacin, tetanus vaccination, and unspecified medications. He had a history of allergies to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim."

SUMMARY STATEMENT
====================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with PMHx High grade lymphoma 
with burkitt's features s/p cycle 6 R-EPOCH, HTN, HLD, DM, and 
gout who presents with abdominal bloating and weight loss at 
home, found to have refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
confirmed on gastric biopsy, initiated on RICE therapy. His 
course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, ___, and one 
episode of hematuria. Problems addressed during his 
hospitalization are as follows:

#Recurrent Burkitts-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
Patient with high grade lymphoma with Burkitt like features 
refractory to 6 cycles of EPOCH-R therapy last given ___. 
Previously had IGH/MYC rearrangement and no evidence of BCL2 or 
BCL6 rearrangements. Initially presented with weight loss and 
abdominal bloating, CT AP demonstrating gastric thickening s/p 
EGD with biopsy demonstrating high grade B-cell lymphoma (CD20, 
CD10 positive; CD5 negative; ___ ISH negative; Ki-67 
proliferation index near 100%). Subsequent FISH and cytogenetics 
demonstrating pending. Initiated ICE therapy Cycle 1 
___ with rituximab administration ___. 
Received filgrastim ___. Initiated acyclovir for 
prophylaxis. Developed ___ likely in setting of Ifosfamide 
administration (see ___ below), otherwise tolerated with no 
issues. 

#Febrile neutropenia:
Tmax ___, otherwise remained afebrile, no source of 
infection identified. No localizing symptoms other than nasal 
erythema suspicious for HSV which he has had in the past, 
however on acyclovir, improved. CXR clear, elevation in alk phos 
(most likely medication effect), PICC line without suspicion for 
infection, no evidence of cellulitis, fungal markers negative, 
blood and urine cultures negative. Completed 7 day course of IV 
cefepime, discontinued when ___>500 over 3 days.

___:
Cr elevated over several days (Cr peak 2.1; baseline 1.1-1.2). 
Etiology most likely ATN supported by urine with fragmented 
granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells. Likely 
developed kidney injury from large volume autodiuresis (up to 
-3.5L over 24H) and medication effect causing tubular injury 
(Ifosfamide). Cr normalized with IVF to keep net fluid balance 
even. Given sodium bicarbonate for acidosis. Of note, in ___ 
developed tumor lysis syndrome at outside hospital (Cr peak 8.4, 
UA 515), renal biopsy with ATN/AIN requiring temporary dialysis. 


#Hematuria with blood clots:
Reported blood clot in urine x1, otherwise asymptomatic. UA 
unremarkable with no evidence of hematuria x2. Resolved 
spontaneously with no intervention. Possibly from ifosfamide 
administration, of note also has bladder mass on CT performed at 
___.

#Guaiac positive stool:
Intermittent melena on admission, resolved with initiation of 
PPI. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#Anemia:
Hg ___, likely due to lymphoma and bone marrow suppression from 
chemotherapy. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#HTN:
In setting of ATN and large volume autidiuresis, reduced home 
labetalol(decreased from 300 to 200 BID) and home amlodipine 
(decreased from 10 to 5 QD). Remained normotensive with this 
dose reduction.

#Gout: 
Continued home allopurinol

#DM:
Continued home NPH 7 qAM, and ISS, held home glyburide

#Moderate malnutrition:
On presentation reported 3.6% weight loss over 2 weeks. Received 
glucerna BID in between meals.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
[] continue to monitor weight [weight at discharge: 68.3 kg, 
weight at admission: 71.35 kg]
[] continue to monitor hematuria, melena 
[] consider initiation of SSRI

IMAGING:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___  FINDINGS:  The position 
of the right-sided PICC line is unchanged.  Heart appears 
enlarged.  Trachea is midline.  There is some widening of 
mediastinum, mainly on the right side of the carina suggestive 
of a loculated pleural effusion.  This does not appear to be 
significantly changed from the prior study.  A small left 
pleural effusion is stable.  There is some improvement of the 
right-sided atelectatic changes.  No pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Marginal improvement of the right lung atelectatic 
changes 
compared to the previous study, otherwise unchanged.
 
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of ___  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis. 
2.  Hepatosplenomegaly. 
3.  Minimal ascites and small right pleural effusion. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___  
There is interval progression of right lower lobe pleural 
effusion and right lung consolidation highly concerning for 
interval development of infectious process.  There is also 
additional involvement of left mid lung opacity, concerning for 
infectious process as well.  Small bilateral pleural effusions 
cannot be excluded.  Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid 
SVC.  The 
heart size and mediastinum are stable. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New peribronchiolar nodular opacities are visualized in the 
posterior 
segment of the right upper lobe as well as in the non-collapsed 
portions of the superior segment of the right lower lobe and are 
suggestive of an 
infectious process. 
2.  Mild interval decrease in dominant loculated right lower 
hemithorax 
pleural effusion/empyema as well as the second large 
paramediastinal right pleural effusion. 
3.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is stable. 

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of ___  4:12:26 ___ 
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Lateral 
ST-T wave 
flattening. No major change from the previous tracing. 
 
CXR ___: IMPRESSION: 1.  Right subclavian PICC line remains 
unchanged in position.  There has been interval worsening of 
consolidation which now involves the right upper lobe and left 
upper and mid lung.  There has also been progression at the left 
lung base.  The right mid and lower lung continues to be stably 
consolidated.  These findings are concerning for worsening 
pneumonia with the differential also including hemorrhage or 
leukemic infiltrates given the patient's history of leukemia.  
Clinical correlation is advised.  The heart remains stably 
enlarged.  There is fullness to the mediastinal contours, some 
of which correlates with a loculated right pleural effusion seen 
on the CT study dated ___.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence 
of pulmonary edema. 

EKG ___: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 
Poor R wave progression, probable normal variant. Low amplitude 
QRS complexes in the limb leads. Non-specific lateral ST-T wave 
changes. Compared to the previous tracing  of ___ QRS 
voltage in the limb leads has decreased further. One aberrantly 
conducted beat versus a ventricular premature beat is seen.

admitted for neutropenic fever and pneumonia, and transferred to 
___ for respiratory distress requiring BiPAP treatment; pt 
stabilized, transferred back to the floor.

Active issues:
#Refractory biphenotypic leukemia: Pt is s/p hyperCVAD, ___, decitabine, MEC ___, several more cycles decitabine last 
___, followed by Dr. ___, now on hydroxurea. Patient is 
neutropenic, thrombocytopenic and anemic.  He will not be 
receiving further chemotherapy.  Patient received supportive 
care with transfusions of red cells and platelets as needed.   

#Neutropenic fever: Patient presented with rhinorrhea developing 
into sorethroat, cough and fever.  A chest x-ray was unchanged 
from previous admission.  The patient was placed on oxygen and 
blood cultures were drawn.  He was continued on voriconazole for 
history of disseminated fusarium and linezolid for history of 
VRE empyema.  Ertapenam was changed to Cefepime given history of 
E. coli bacteremia in order to broaden for possible Pseudomonas. 
 The infectious disease team was consulted, who recommended 
switching cefepime to meropenem.  A respiratory culture was done 
and the patient was found to be positive for parainfluenza.  The 
patient's respiratory status declined over the course of the 
next week. A CT was done on ___ which showed new 
peribronchiolar opacity in right upper and right lower lobe 
compatible with infection.  On ___ antibiotics were changed to 
voriconazole, cefepime, metronidazole, linezolid and levaquin.  
The patient was supported with albuterol nebulizers and 
ipratropium for obstructive lung disease along with cough 
suppressants.  Respiratory status declined acutely on ___ 
the patient desaturated to 84% and was placed on a 
non-rebreather briefly and then transitioned to a mask on 6 
liters.  An arterial blood gas revealed a PO2 of 43 and PCO2 of 
48.  The patient and family wished to persue BiPap and the 
patient was transferred to the ICU for continued care. While in 
the ICU, pt was briefly on BiPaP overnight but was soon able to 
be on shovel mask. He was gently diuresed and his respiratory 
status remained stable on shovel mask O2. Pt was transferred out 
of the ICU and onto the ___ floor. While on the floor he 
received a prednisone taper (40mg x2days, 30x2days, 20x2days, 
10x2days). He also received 10g IVIG.  Pt was switched to 
xopenex from albuterol nebs due to tachycardia. Pt's respiratory 
status slowly improved and he remained stable on ___ NC. His IV 
antibiotics were taken off and he remained afebrile for several 
days prior to discharge.  

Chronic issues:  
# Atrial fibrillation: History of paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation. Rate control has previously been difficult with 
hypotension on beta blockade. Patient was continued on 
metoprolol 50 mg BID, digoxin 12mcg daily and diltiazem in 
fractionated doses.  His rates were in the low 100's to 110's 
and systolic blood pressures were mostly in the 90's, consistent 
with prior admissions.  In the ICU, his rates were increased to 
the 130's, and his metoprolol was increased to 50 mg PO TID.  He 
tolerated this well. He was continued on this regimen upon 
transfer to the floor.

# Hepatitis B: Patient has known hepatitis B and was continued 
on Lamivudine 100mg po daily.

# Anxiety: The patient was continued on home lorazepam 0.5mg 
tabs q4hrs as needed.  
  
Transitional issues:
# Goals of care: Per most recent clinic note, Pt has a 
___ Care form at home. He is DNR/DNI but does 
want antibiotics, blood products, and admission if he becomes 
ill.  Pt does not want additional ICU admissions or Bipap.
# Pt will need close follow up and continued platelet and blood 
transfusions

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo F with a history of triple negative BRCA1+ 
breast cancer diagnosed in ___. She underwent bilateral 
mastectomy and chemotherapy at that time. She has been generally 
lost to follow-up but was hospitalized recently for shortness of 
breath and found to have recurrence of her cancer.  
 Body imaging showed extensive probable metastases in the thorax 
with adenopathy and numerous pulmonary nodules as well as some 
left lung segment collapse. She did not have large pleural or 
pericardial effusions. The abdomen was benign including the 
liver. Bone scan, however, showed numerous abnormalities 
suggesting skeletal metastases. Widespread skeletal involvement 
is somewhat uncommon in triple-negative cancers, but the bone 
scan compared to prior scans does show a marked change. Her 
tumor marker is mildly elevated. She has some hoarseness, which 
likely reflects left recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement given 
the high concentration of disease in her left upper chest.  

 She now comes in because reports that she has had a severe 
headache and nausea for the past 48 hours. She reports that she 
has been waking up with a headaches every morning this week; 
however, this headache has persisted since yesterday and has not 
resolved. She reports she has been feeling nauseous and has not 
been able to each much. Reports that today she ""vomited up 
bile."" She denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope. 
Reports that she has had difficulty seeing out of her L eye and 
""can only see half a word"" when she reads.  

 In the ED, she had a head CT that showed:  
 There are multiple intracranial metastatic lesions. A lesion in 
the right occipital lobe best seen on series 602 B image 31 
measures approximately 3.1 x 3.1 cm and is complicated by a 
small amount of intralesional hemorrhage. There is associated 
vasogenic edema. Additional lesions are seen, for example and 
extra-axial lesion on series 2, image 23 abutting the inner 
table of the frontal bone in a left para falcine location. A 
small hyperdense lesion at the left parietal vertex is seen on 
series 2, image 25. A lesion abutting the  
 frontal lobe is seen on series 2, image 13 measuring 
approximately 1.4 x 3.7 cm. There is no midline shift or 
downward herniation though there is asymmetric effacement of 
right cerebral sulci compared to the left.  
 She was evaluated by neurosurgery who recommended Keppra, 
Dexamethasone, keeping SBP<140, and MRI scan.  
 
 On arrival to the floor, patient is tired, but otherwise well 
appearing.  
 REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 10 point ROS was performed and was 
otherwise negative.  
 
Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY  
She initially presented in early ___ with a multicentric 
high-grade triple-negative left breast cancer. The largest focus 
of invasive cancer was 5 cm. There was no lymphovascular 
invasion and her four sentinel lymph nodes sampled at the time 
of mastectomy in ___ were negative. The contralateral 
prophylactic right mastectomy was negative pathologically.  
 BRCA testing showed a BRCA1 mutation.  
 Thus, she had an advanced left breast cancer which was 
multifocal but no lymph node spread while the right breast was 
negative. Following recovery from her mastectomy and her 
bilateral ___ flap reconstructions, a port was inserted and she 
began dose-dense cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in early ___. She received four doses of dose-dense cyclophosphamide and 
doxorubicin followed by weekly paclitaxel. Dr. ___ was 
consulted, but did not feel that she required post mastectomy 
radiation therapy based on free margins, the absence of 
lymphovascular invasion and the absence of nodal involvement.  
 Following her chemotherapy there was no additional systemic 
therapy given because of her triple-negative status. We did 
strongly encourage her to have a prophylactic bilateral BSO, but 
she opted to defer that following completion of her other 
therapy. In fact, this was never done and she had a long 
interval where she did not ___ for routine followup here.  
 She was recently seen for shortness of breath. Re-staging 
showed recurrent disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery 
service with acute cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation) and 
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder 
removed laparoscopically.  This procedure went well.  Your pain 
is better controlled and you are now tolerating a regular diet. 

The Psychiatry service met with you given your thoughts of 
self-harm, and have recommended that you be discharged to a 
Psychiatric facility for further mental health care.  

You are now medically cleared to be discharged from the 
hospital. Please note the following discharge instructions:

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  During your hospitalization, you had surgery to 
remove unhealthy tissue on your lower extremity.  You tolerated 
the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the 
hospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a 
speedy and uneventful recovery.

LOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS

ACTIVITY 
You should keep your amputation site elevated and straight 
whenever possible.  This will prevent swelling of the stump and 
maintain flexibility in your joint.  
It is very important that you put no weight or pressure on 
your stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal 
properly. 
You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if 
applicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and 
learn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  

MEDICATION
Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!  

You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on 
discharge which  can be very constipating.  If you take 
narcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   
If constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest 
an additional over the counter laxative. 

You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for 
pain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic 
pain medication.  You should require less pain medication each 
day.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  
Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter 
and prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you 
are taking in a day.

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or 
pools until you have permission from your surgeon and the 
incision is fully healed.
After your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub 
the area. 

WOUND CARE:
Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that 
there is no pressure on the stump.    If there is no drainage, 
you may leave the incision open to air.  
Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks.  At 
your followup appointment, we will see if the incision has 
healed enough to remove the staples. 
Before you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to 
replace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be 
fully healed. 

CALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___
Opening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision 

Redness, swelling or warmth in your stump.
Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening 
incisional/stump pain  

NO OTHER PROVIDER, EXCEPT YOUR VASCULAR SURGEON, SHOULD 
DETERMINE IF YOUR STAPLES ARE READY TO BE REMOVED FROM YOUR 
STUMP! 
  
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE 
VASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.   THE 
STAPLES WILL BE REMOVED IN THE OFFICE AT YOUR FOLLOWUP 
APPOINTMENT WHEN IT IS DETERMINED BY THE VASCULAR SURGEON THAT 
THE WOUND HAS SUFFICIENTLY HEALED.

 
Followup Instructions:
___

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was taken to the operating room on ___ for 
removal of her peritoneal dialysis catheter. The case was 
uncomplicated, please see the associated oeprative report for 
further details. She experienced chest pain in the PACU - 
troponins were found to be higher than her baseline at 0.58 but 
EKG was unchanged from priors. She was given sublingual 
nitroglycerine and full strength aspirin and her chest pain 
resolved. Given her history cardiology was consulted who 
recommended putting her on PRN isosorbide because of her labile 
blood pressures, but did not think she required cardiac 
catheterization at this time. 
On ___, a tunneled right IJ HD line was placed by 
interventional radiology, and she was subsequently dialyzed via 
the line successfully. She was noted to be more hypertensive on 
this day, up to the 190s, and was started on losartan per 
cardiology recommendations, which improved her BP. Her troponins 
were noted to be trending down. She did experience another 
episode of chest pain overnight on ___ which was associated 
with hypertension into the 170s. She received 30mg Isosorbide 
and 0.4 sublingual nitroglycerine and her pain resolved. 
Cardiology was contacted again on ___ regarding the chest 
pain overnight given that she was otherwise ready for discharge. 
They did not recommend any further interventions and advised it 
would be fine to send her home on the carvedilol, losartan, and 
prn isosorbide for BP's >170. She was therefore discharged home 
on ___ with instructions to follow up with her ___ 
cardiologist and Dr. ___ as an outpatient

Pertinent Results:
___ TEE
Pre-bypass:
 The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic 
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion. There is a minimally increased gradient 
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are 
myxomatous. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen with 
posterior leaflet redundancy and prolapse. This affects P3 the 
most but is present throughout the posterior leaflet.. Due to 
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no 
pericardial effusion. Findings communicated at time of incision.

ECHO: ___
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30%) secondary to 
akinesis of the entire inferior wall, inferior septum, and 
dyskinesis of the basal infero-lateral wall. The apex, distal 
anterior and anteroseptal walls contract best. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The number 
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-severe regional and global systolic 
dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild global right ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild dilatation of the 
aortic root.  

CXR: ___
IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with unknown PMH presented s/p cardiac arrest, with 
diffuse coronary disease s/p DES to OM1, transferred to ICU 
intubated.

#. Cardiac Arrest: s/p cardiac arrest likely scarring causing 
ventricular arrhythmia. Not felt to be due to acute ischemia.  
Now rewarmed and extubated. Unclear etiology of VT, will be seen 
by EP regarding need for ICD as well as cardiac MRI to evaluate 
for scar which may have contributed.

#Fever: patient spiking while on warming protocol requiring cool 
water to slow warming process, likely in setting of infection.  
Patient has been cultured when he spikes. Possibly related to 
GPC in respiratory cx, however had witnessed aspiration event. 
Initially on vanc/zosyn/flagyl, however transitioned on day 5 to 
levofloxacin po, to complete total 8-day course

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted this hospitalization following a cardiac 
arrest. You underwent a cooling of your body temperature to help 
decrease any negative effects on the brain following cardiac 
arrest. The likely cause of your arrest is an arrythmia as a 
result of scarring from coronary artery disease. 

In order to assess the perfusion of the heart by the coronary 
arteries you underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed 
multiple blockages in the conroary arteries. We were able to 
place a stent in one of the arteries; the obtuse marginal branch 
of the left circumflex artery that feeds the side portion of the 
heart muscle.

At the time of your cardiac arrest your heart pupming function 
was depressed. A most recent echocardiogram revealed that the 
pumping function has greatly improved since the time of your 
arrest.

You have been started on the following new medications:
Aspirin 81 mg daily: this is taken to decrease clot in the 
coronary arteries

Atorvastatin 80mg daily: this is a cholesterol medication taken 
to decrease worsening of plaque formation.

Lisinopril 5mg daily: this decreases the resistance the heart 
has to pump against and thereby decreased the blood pressure

Metoprolol XL 100mg daily: this medication decresases the 
workload of the heart by decreasing the heart rate and thereby 
the blood pressure

Ticagelor 90mg two times a day: This medication decreases the 
risk of clot formation where the stent was placed. 

KCL 20meq daily: you have required Potaassium daily since your 
admission. You should take this daily and then have labs checked 
on ___ by visiting nursing to assess your response. 

PLEASE CONTINUE:
Metformin 100mg XL twice a day for your diabetes
Sertraline 200mg daily for depression
Levothyroxeine 50mcg daily
 
PLEASE HOLD until seen by your PCP/Cardiologist:
Wellbutrin
Mirtazapine

****Failure to take the Ticagelor and the aspirin could result 
in a lifethreatening heart attack**** 

You have been set up with a Lifevest. The details of this device 
have been discussed with you. If you go into a lifethreatening 
arrythmia again, this device will detect that arrythmia and 
deliver an electric shock to return you to a normal sinus 
rythym. The plan is for you to eventually receieve an internal 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in the future once your heart 
has been given time to recover from your recent cardiac arrest. 
This will be discussed in follow up with the electrophysiology 
team as an outpatient.

You should avoid stressful situations and exercise while you are 
wearing the lifevest. You also CANNOT drive with the lifevest. 
You may participate in your reguilar activities including 
walking as long as this does not cause you physical strain.  
  
You will need a variety of follow up appointments as detailed 
below.

You will need labs in 6 weeks to assess your liver function and 
cholesterol panel since we increased your statin or cholesterol 
medication.  You will also need your electrolytes and your 
kidney function checked on ___ as we have started 
you on a medication called Lisinopril and a potassium 
supplement. 

Today we discussed heart failure and the need to weigh yourself 
every day before breakfast as well as the improtance of 
following a low salt diet. If your weight goes up by more than 3 
lbs in 2 days you should call Dr. ___ cardiologist). 

If you have any questions or concerns related to your symptoms 
or your hospitalization you can call the heartline which has 
been given to you with your discharge paperwork. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 47-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. He was found to have severe 2-vessel coronary artery disease, with chronic total occlusion of the left circumflex artery and occlusion of the OM1 branch. He underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the OM1 branch. His past medical history includes diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, depression, sleep apnea, and hypothyroidism. He has no known allergies or adverse reactions.

The patient's diagnosis includes moderate-severe regional and global systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease, mild global right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and mild mitral regurgitation. He was treated with aspirin, ticagrelor, and atorvastatin, and was also prescribed metoprolol and lisinopril.

The patient's medications at discharge include levothyroxine, sertraline, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol."

Relevant Imaging:
------------------
TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrial volume index 
is mildly increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 60 %). There 
is a calcified subvalvular undulating mass on the aortomitral 
continuum. There maybe also a smaller mass opposite on the 
anteroseptal base. This could be a subdiaphragmatic ridge 
without impedence to blood flow since the peak flow across the 
aortic valve is not elevated. In proper clinical context 
endocarditis (fever, bacteremia) is in the differential (clip 2, 
20). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular regional/global systolic 
function. Subaortic mass, which may be simple atypical 
calcification, a non-obstructing myocardial ridge, or in proper 
clinical context endocarditis.

Please see OMR for cardiac catheterization report.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with CAD with prior MI ___ ago) with POBA to unknown 
vessel  
presents with 3 days of persistent chest tightness found to have 
posterior STEMI with occlusion of distal circumflex  

# Posterior Acute MI: Given that she presented with a STEMI, she 
went to the cath lab and is now s/p DES to culprit distal 
circumflux thrombotic occlusion. She was also noted to have an 
RCA with diffuse irregularities with mid disease of 70%. This 
was not intervened on. Pt with some mild chest pain post-cath 
but EKG reassuring, including posterior leads, which essentially 
ruled out stent thrombosis acutely. Tirofiban gtt continued 2hrs 
post cath. Initially on ticagrelor, transitioned to plavix 
because of the need for coumadin in context of APLS. Initially 
held metop given HR in 40 to low ___. TTE showed Normal 
biventricular regional/global systolic function. Cardiac 
medications were optimized to include Atorvastain 80 daily, 
Metoprolol (for residual RCA disease), restarted home ACEI and 
losartan (although in the outpatient setting, may consider 
either ACEI or ___. She continued on aspirin and plavix as 
above. In the setting of substantial anticoagulation, she 
developed several small hematomas throughout her arms and inner 
thighs; her CBC remained stable, as did her hemodynamics and she 
did not have evidence of internal bleeding. She remained stable 
on regimen of ASA, plavix, coumadin and was discharged without 
progression or worsening of hematomas. She was discharged with 
close cardiology follow-up.   

# HTN: on ACEI and ___ possibly in part from CKD but should 
likely be streamlined to ACEI only. SBPs  initially soft in 
90-100s in setting of acute MI; restarted lisinopril and ___ as 
above; discontinued spironolactone.

# OSA: continued home CPAP while in house.  

# Antiphospholipid syndrome on coumadin: INR 1.6 on admission; 
restarted home warfarin, bridged with lovenox and trended INR.   


# CKD: likely early stage with proteinuria. Cr WNL. On ACEI and 
___ per above.  
Trended Creatinine, which was 0.9 on discharge.   

# Tobacco use: nicotine patch while in house; smoking cessation 
counseling  

# Anxiety: continued home paxil and PRN ativan  

# Fibromyalgia: continued home gabapentin.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***
- discharged on losartan, she is also on lisinopril and should 
have lab chemistries checked on ___ (can consider 
choosing either lisinopril or losartan as an outpatient going 
forward).
- discontinued her home aldactone
- plavix loaded in house, she should take 75mg PO daily until 
told to discontinue by her cardiologist. 
- continue coumadin; INR therapeutic
- If chest pain recurs then repeat angio with FFR of the RCA 
lesion recommended

History of Present Illness:
___ with PMH CAD, DM with CKD, Afib, HLP presents for the second 
time in a month with the complaint of exertional dyspnea and 
chest discomfort.  

Of note, pt was recently seen here ___ with the complaint of 
shortness of breath after dialysis.  She was diagnosed with 
volume overload, underwent ultrafiltration and diuresis and was 
discharged to rehab.

Since that time, the patient notes that she initially felt 
better but would still get short of breath with minimal 
exertion.  She states that when she gets up to the bathroom from 
her bed, she feels acutely short of breath.  This symptom is 
associated with a burning sensation in her substernal region 
that radiates directly upward towards her throat.  This morning 
she was walking into the ___ clinic when she began to feel 
those symptoms.  As she was recently hospitalized with similar 
symptoms in ___, the Renal doctors ___ with 
___ and removed 3L.  Her symptoms persisted and she 
was then sent to the ___ ED.

In the ED, the patient was still having symptoms.  An EKG showed 
slight <1mm ST depressions in the lateral leads.  She was given 
ASA 325, and a SL nitroglycerin relieved her chest discomfort.  
Labs were notable for a troponin level of 0.08, and a d-dimer 
was positive.  Subsequent CTA was negative for PE or aortic 
dissection.   She was then transferred up to the Cardiology 
Floor.

On the floor, the patient is without chest discomfort, shortness 
of breath, nausea, diaphoresis etc.  

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or 
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the 
other review of systems were negative.  
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STRESS ___:
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes. 
Baseline systolic hypertension with an appropriate hemodynamic 
response 
to the Persantine infusion. Nuclear report sent separately. 

Coronary CT ___:
FINDINGS: 
  
Coronary arteries are coming out of conventional origin. 
  
LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY: The proximal portion and the mid 
portion of the 
left main coronary artery are patent with no appreciable 
atherosclerotic 
disease. 
  
LAD: Just at the bifurcation of left main coronary artery into 
LAD and 
circumflex, there is significant atherosclerotic disease 
represented as 
calcified and soft plaque with a significant narrowing/almost 
occluding the 
proximal portion of LAD by soft plaque. The mid and distal 
portions of the 
LAD are free of disease. 
  
LEFT CIRCUMFLEX: Extensive disease involves the entire left 
circumflex 
artery. At the proximal portion, no apparent obstruction of 
circumflex is 
noted. The patient has left dominance. 
  
RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: The right coronary artery is small, 
heavily calcified 
and potentially excluded. 
  
Extensive calcifications of the branches of LAD and circumflex 
are present. 
  
The airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi 
bilaterally. The 
pulmonary arteries are dilated as demonstrated on the recent CT 
of the chest 
consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Cardiomegaly is present 
. Diffuse 
ground-glass opacities within the lungs in conjunction with air 
trapping are 
noted. This appears similar to prior study from ___ and 
might reflect 
expiratory character of the study or mild volume overload. No 
pleural or 
pericardial effusion is noted. Left ventricular enlargement with 
prominence 
of the apical enlargement is seen.

LAD:  moderate calcification.   Mid vessel 50% with bifurcating
diagonal with diffuse disease.  Lower pole 80% stenosis 
unchanged
from ___.
LCX:  Diffuse noncritical disease.  Small OM1 origin 40%.  OM2
has proximal 70% stenosis also unchanged from ___.
RCA:  Widely patent stent in a small vessel.  Diffuse 40-50%
stenoses.

Assessment & Recommendations
1.Unchanged angiography from ___.
2.Diastolic CHF with elevated LVEDP.
3.Medical management of CAD and CHF.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH of CAD, DM and ESRD presents with complaint of 
exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort.
  
# CORONARIES:
- Pt's story of exertional symptoms and atypical chest pain 
occur with roughly the same amount of exertion, relieved by 
nitroglycerin, and never at rest
- With PMH CAD, this presentation was concerning for stable 
angina
- initially treated with medical therapy with ASA, statin, and 
agressive afterload reduction
- PMIBI results concerning for multiterritorial perfusion 
defects
- Main concern regarding the results of her PMIBI was the 
possibility of left main disease, which would require a high 
risk cath
- This has been verified with the presence of high grade 
proximal LAD and LCx disease (left main equivalent) on Coronary 
CTA
- After a risk/benefit discussion with patient and family the 
decision was made for cardiac catheterization
  - Cath results failed to reveal any significant left main 
disease, or any worsening CAD from prior study in ___
- Pt was not placed on Plavix ___ concern regarding her 
anemia/thrombocytopenia and potential fall risk at home
.  
# PUMP:  
- last echo on ___ with preserved EF, clinically appears 
euvolemic but with evidence of elevated LVEDP to 32 during cath
- communicated to the Nephrology team that pt should be dialyzed 
as aggressively as possible to optimize fluid status, as volume 
overload could contribute to her symptoms of DOE
- dc'ed home lasix as not likely to be of any benefit, pt has 
very little UOP ___ ESRD
.  
#  HTN
- currently SBP 110's-150, will control to goal <140
- Continued home meds amlodipine, clonidine and lisinopril at 
current doses, increased imdur to 60mg daily
- if further titration is needed in the outpatient setting PO 
hydralazine would be a good option
.
# Skin Lesions
- Pt initially presented with eczematous lesion on face that was 
treated symptomatically with sarna lotion with subjective 
improvement per patient
- On ___, pt found to have R hand swelling and multiple areas 
of painless skin sloughing
- Dermatology consult was obtained, placed pt on regimen of 
steroid cream for her face, bactroban for the hand lesion which 
was thought to be skin sloughing from an infiltrated IV
- RUE US negative for DVT
- skin creams were continued as an outpatient regimen
.
# UTI
- pt with complaint of dysuria on admission, previous UCx + for 
VRE on last admission which was not treated
- Initially placed on empiric linezolid while cx data brewing 
___ prior untreated VRE
- ___, Ucx with pan sensitive E coli and other G+ flora, 
continued tx with cipro to complete 10d course.  Repeat culture 
with GNR

Dear Ms ___, 

You were admitted to the ___ for the evaluation of your 
shortness of breath.  We performed many studies including a 
stress test to evaluate whether a blockage in your coronary 
arteries was causing your shortness of breath.  You underwent a 
cardiac catheterization that did not show any new blockage in 
your coronaries to explain your symptoms.  After we made some 
adjustments to your blood pressure regimen and took off some 
fluid at dialysis you felt better and were safe for discharge 
home.  

Please take all medications as prescribed.  Weigh yourself every 
morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Medications:
Added: Hydrocerin (Eucerin) cream, Hydrocortisone cream, 
mupirocin cream, sarna lotion, zinc soap, 
Changed: Imdur (increased to 60mg daily) and simvastatin 
(decreased to 40mg daily)
Removed: Lasix

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort. She has a past medical history of CAD, DM with CKD, Afib, and HLP. She was recently hospitalized for volume overload and underwent ultrafiltration and diuresis. On admission, her troponin level was 0.08, and a d-dimer was positive. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed significant atherosclerotic disease in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She was diagnosed with mitral regurgitation and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of unknown percentage.

The patient's medications at discharge include ASA 325 and SL nitroglycerin. She has a history of allergies to Motrin. Her physical examination was notable for a palpable pulse in the right and left carotid, femoral, popliteal, and dorsal pedal arteries. Her skin examination showed multiple areas of shallow ulceration and apparent desquamation on the dorsum of her right hand.

The patient's review of systems was negative for prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denied recent fevers, chills, or rigors."

History of Present Illness:
___ M in ___ until ~2 months ago when developed dysphagia 
while traveling in ___.  Specifically he noticed a stuck 
sensation in his upper chest followed by regurgitation of food 
chunks. These symptoms resolved by the next day.  Soon 
thereafter he experienced low-grade epigastric pain that lasted 
for three days
and self-resolved.  He recently again experienced dysphagia and 
regurgitation to chunky foods which has persisted; currently he 
is tolerating only a liquid diet.  He then experienced 
significant epigastric pain prompting presentation to an urgent 
care clinic, leading to an Abdominal CT on ___ showing a
large gastric tumor extending to the esophagus with hepatic 
metastasis.  This was followed by an EGD and biopsy at ___ 
___; the pathology was referred yesterday to ___ for 
further review.  He was evaluated at ___ for management of this 
tumor and presents here for a second opinion.

Currently his major complaint is dysphagia to all solids.  He 
was performing well with liquids and Ensure diet. His epigastric 
pain is lingering and controlled with percocet, primarily at 
night to facilitate sleep.  He has lost 30 pounds over the past 
3 months.

Since his office visit last ___, he has had continued 
symptoms. He had a PET CT today at ___ which he has brought with 
him and had returned home prior to his brain MRI which had been 
scheduled for this afternoon. The pain continued, however, and 
so he came in for admission, IVF, EGD with possible stent 
placement tomorrow, and possible rebiopsy.

On exam, he appears quite uncomfortable and is tachycardic to 
120. He has received 1 L of IVF so far and will be further

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service due 
to inability to tolerate POs. He was tachycardic at initial 
presentation thought to be due to dehydration as well as the 
pain and discomfort of his obstruction. This tachycardia had 
resolved prior to discharge with fluid resuscitation as well as 
Roxicet medication. 

On HD 2, the patient underwent EGD which showed a large gastric 
mass circumferentially at the GE junction across which an 
esophageal stent was successfully deployed. Biopsies were also 
taken as the biopsies from the OSH, although showing malignancy, 
were still undeterminate as to of which origin. 

He did well post-procedure and was able to tolerate a full 
liquid diet after the stent placement. Pain control also 
improved with liquid oxycodone-acetaminophen. 

At discharge, he was tolerating a full liquid diet including 
Ensure for nutritional support and was no longer tachycardic. He 
was much more comfortable with pain well controlled on Roxicet. 
He will follow up with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ oncology and 
appointments have already been made.

___ gastric cancer (diagnosed ___, currently on ramucirumab 
alone (held following surgery) and arthritis, who presented with 
a hip fracture after a fall from standing height.  

===ACUTE ISSUES=== 
#Hip fracture:  
#s/p Fall:  
Presented after a fall from standing height and found to have a 
right intertrochanteric hip fracture with varus angulation. CT 
head with subgaleal hematoma but no intracranial hemorrhage, and 
CT C spine negative for traumatic injury. Fall appears to be 
purely mechanical secondary to underlying neuropathy and 
progressive weakness with possible acute decompensation in the 
setting of pneumonia. She had no LOC, but may have an 
orthostatic component as well contributing to lightheadedness 
given poor PO intake. Troponins obtained for pre-op workup were 
slightly elevated x3 (max 0.03). Likely ___ slight ___, EKGs w/o 
e/o MI. 

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service with 
a right hip fracture. The patient was taken to the operating 
room on ___ for right hip ORIF, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given ___ antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient worked with ___ who 
determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
weight-bearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity, and 
will be discharged on ___ for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough discussion was 
had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or 
return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The 
patient was also given written instructions concerning 
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care. 
The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

 
#LLL pneumonia: CXR obtained on pre-op workup showed LLL 
opacity. Unclear if she had a true clinical pneumonia given she 
so did not have symptoms of pneumonia, but fall could be due to 
weakness in the setting of infection. Did not meet criteria for 
HAP. Treated with five day course of ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin. 
 
===CHRONIC ISSUES===
#Gastric cancer: 
Diagnosed ___. Treated with 5 cycles on folfox, followed by 
taxol/ramucirumab for 5 cycles (C5 D1 and ___. Seen by

taxol and proceeding with ramucirumab alone due to concerns that 
the taxol was causing worsening neuropathy and interfering with 
her quality of life. Of note, ramucirumab was held following her 
operation. Will need outpatient evaluation and discussion of 
goals of care to determine further treatment course. In 
addition, patient had therapeutic paracentesis while inpatient 
on ___.

#GERD: Continued home omeprazole BID.  
#Hypertension: Held spironolactone given elevated creatinine at 
___ initially, restarted on ___.

RADIOLOGY
=========
___ CXR PA LAT
FINDINGS: 
Evaluation is somewhat limited due to lordotic positioning and 
patient
rotation.  Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta 
is diffusely
calcified and mildly tortuous.  Lung volumes are low which 
accentuates the
width of the superior mediastinal contour.  Increased 
interstitial opacities
are noted diffusely which suggests a chronic interstitial 
abnormality, though
mild interstitial pulmonary edema is not excluded.  No focal 
consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The osseous 
structures are
diffusely demineralized. Irregularity of the left second and 
third lateral
ribs may reflect fractures.   Height loss of 2 vertebral bodies 
at the
thoracolumbar junction are of indeterminate age.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to positioning and patient rotation.
2. Diffuse interstitial opacities could suggest a chronic 
interstitial lung
disease with mild interstitial pulmonary edema not excluded.
3. Irregularity of the left second and third lateral ribs 
suggestive of
fractures.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion clearly seen.
4. Compression deformities of 2 adjacent vertebral bodies at the 
thoracolumbar
junction are of indeterminate age.

___ KNEE XR
FINDINGS: 
Patient is status post right total knee arthroplasty which 
appears in normal
alignment without hardware complications or loosening.  There is 
a trace joint
effusion.  Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized 
without acute
fracture.  Vascular calcifications are noted.  No concerning 
lytic or
sclerotic osseous abnormalities detected.
 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute fracture or dislocation.  Status post right total knee 
arthroplasty
without hardware complications.  Small joint effusion.

___ CT PELVIS WO CONTRAST
FINDINGS: 
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions.  No 
acute fracture
or dislocation.  Partially imaged lumbar spine demonstrates 
levoscoliosis. 
Moderate to severe degenerative changes are seen in the lower 
lumbar spine. 
Mild degenerative changes are seen in bilateral femoroacetabular 
joints with
subchondral sclerosis and mild joint space narrowing.  Patient 
is status post
L3-L4 laminectomies.
 
SOFT TISSUES:  A gallstone is seen in the partially imaged 
gallbladder which
appears distended.  The partially imaged right kidney 
demonstrates several
hypodense cysts as well as an intermediate density cyst arising 
from the lower
pole (03:14) measuring 8 mm.  There is large stool burden in the 
rectum and
nonspecific presacral fat stranding.  Diverticulosis of the 
colon is noted,
without evidence of diverticulitis.  Calcified and hypodense 
fibroids are
noted within a bulky uterus.  A left inguinal hernia containing 
fat is noted. 
There is diffuse soft tissue anasarca. Severe atherosclerotic 
vascular
calcifications are noted.  Coarse calcifications in the 
bilateral gluteal
regions likely represent injection granulomas.  No joint 
effusion is seen.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or dislocation.
2. Large stool burden in the rectum with nonspecific presacral 
fat stranding.
3. Colonic diverticulosis.
4. Fibroid uterus.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Partially imaged right lower pole renal cysts, one of which 
is intermediate
in density and could be further assessed with dedicated renal 
ultrasound.

___ R HIP XR
FINDINGS: 
The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.  No acute 
fracture or
dislocation is present.  Mild degenerative changes are seen 
involving the
right femoroacetabular joint with subchondral sclerosis and 
joint space
narrowing.  No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous 
abnormalities detected. 
Scattered vascular calcifications are seen.  Coarse 
heterogeneous
calcification in the imaged right pelvis is compatible with a 
calcified
fibroid uterus.  Large amount of stool is partially imaged 
within the rectum.
 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute fracture or dislocation.  No findings to suggest 
avascular necrosis. 
Mild degenerative changes of the right hip joint.

___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular 
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is 
normal (2.1 cm; nl>1.6cm) consistent with normal right 
ventricular systolic function. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. 
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic 
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle. Normal 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic 
and mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
Severe pulmonary hypertension. No valvular vegetations seen. 

___ CXR AP
IMPRESSION: 
Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
Persistent tear of mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality may 
be due to
chronic lung disease rather than edema.  Heart size is 
top-normal.  Pleural
effusions small if any.  No pneumothorax.
 
Atherosclerotic calcification is heavy in the normal size 
thoracic aorta.
 
PA and lateral chest radiograph strongly recommended for 
evaluation of the
lower lobes and possible pneumonia on the left.
 
Healed left upper rib fractures noted.

___ MRI R HIP WO CONTRAST
FINDINGS: 
There is normal marrow signal within the right femoral head. 
There is no
evidence of avascular necrosis, fracture, stress fracture. The 
marrow signal
throughout the rest of the pelvis is within normal limits. The 
imaged
sacroiliac joints show no erosive changes.
 
Focused imaging of the right hip demonstrates a small amount of 
joint fluid.
There is moderate loss of joint space with thinning of the 
articular
cartilage.  There is a superior lateral labral tear.
 
Minimal fluid seen in the trochanteric bursa.  There is mild to 
moderate
insertional tendinopathy involving the gluteus medius tendon.  
Mild
insertional tendinopathy of the hamstrings onto the ischial 
tuberosity.
 
Limited assessment of intra-pelvic soft tissue structures 
demonstrates a large
fluid filled structure in the right hemipelvis measuring 5.1 x 
5.5 cm) with an
internal solid component. No gross intrapelvic fluid.
 
Diffuse generalized anasarca are seen within the soft tissues of 
the imaged
pelvis and proximal lower extremities.
 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No significant right hip joint effusion.  Normal marrow 
signal in the
pelvis or right femur, no definite evidence for septic joint. .  
Mild
insertional tendinopathy involving the gluteus medius and 
hamstring tendons.
 
Incidental large cystic lesion with internal solid component in 
the right
hemipelvis, recommend further assessment with a transvaginal 
ultrasound to
exclude an endometrial/ovarian mass.

___ PELVIC US
FINDINGS: 
The uterus is anteverted and measures approximately 8.1 x 5.4 x 
6.0 cm and
contains fibroids. The endometrium is dilated with a large 
amount anechoic
fluid contains debris an echogenic nodule measuring 1.6 x 1.2 
cm,
corresponding to nodularity as seen on MRI. No increased 
internal vascularity
noted.
 
The ovaries are not visualized.  There is no free fluid.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Fluid-filled dilated endometrial cavity may suggest cervical 
stenosis
without features to suggest infection.
2. Redemonstrated 1.6 x 1.2 cm endometrial solid nodule as seen 
on prior MRI. 
Differential considerations favor a intrauterine fibroid, 
although endometrial
polyp is difficult to exclude.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
===============
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a past medical history
of rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone, ESRD on ___ HD,
COPD on 2L home O2, recent episode of ESBL E. Coli bacteremia
___, completed treatment with Zosyn for 14 day course) who 
presented to ___ with 3 days of atraumatic right hip pain 
concerning for septic arthritis, likely seeded by her recurrence 
of her E. coli bacteremia. She was transferred to ___, treated 
with IV antibiotics, seen by ID, orthopedics, had a R hip MRI, 
and discharged on meropenem for 6 weeks with OPAT follow up.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#ESBL E Coli bacteremia
Blood cultures positive from ___ and ED for GNRs. His 
cultures grew in recurrent ESBL E. Coli from ___, for which 
she already completed a course of zosyn x14d. TTE negative for 
vegetation. The source of the ESBL E Coli is unknown but we 
considered GI vs GU, given her history of rectal prolapse per 
her report (she had seen a colorectal surgeon at ___). 
Colorectal surgery saw her during this admission and firmly 
believed her ectropion was not an infectious source. The E Coli 
was sensitive to meropenem. ID was consulted and she was treated 
with IV meropenem for 6 week course. Her ___ blood culture was 
positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, but this was 
speciated to coag negative staph and was likely a contaminant. 

#Leukocytosis: Initially elevated to ___ iso bacteremia as well 
chronic elevation from steroid use. Downtrending on discharge to 
baseline with treatment of bacteremia as above. Discharge WBC: 
16.8. 

#Septic Joint
Initially concerning for septic arthritis vs. trochanteric 
bursitis.
Atraumatic hip pain. Joint aspirate with 22K WBCs and Hct 22,
negative culture. However she had already received two days of 
antibiotics at the time of aspiration. She was seen by ortho, 
who thought her pain was likely trochanteric bursitis. GNRs 
would also be an atypical cause of septic arthritis, but the hip 
could have been seeded during her recent bacteremia. Rheum and 
ID both agreed with the diagnosis of a likely septic joint and 
recommend wash out, which was deferred by orthopedics. An MRI R 
hip was obtained notable for small effusion with no evidence of 
a septic joint. Rheumatology was concerned that she may not 
improve with antibiotics alone given the severity of her RA, 
however, the decision was made to treat the patient 
conservatively with IV antibiotics. Patient seemed to improve 
clinically with antibiotics with improved mobility at the joint 
so a wash-out was deferred in agreeance with all consulting 
services. She had a PICC line placed on ___ for continued 
antibiotics. 

#Incidental Uterine Mass
#Cervical stenosis
Incidentally found mass seen on her MRI of her R hip. She had a 
follow up pelvic US which showed a likely fibroid vs. polyp. The 
ultrasound also revealed a fluid filled uterine cavity 
concerning for cervical stenosis. The patient was asymptomatic. 
She will need outpatient gynecology follow-up. 

#ESRD on HD 
#Hyperkalemia
Initially became fluid overloaded and hyperkalemic in the 
setting of missing HD. Transferred to the ICU for 2 days until 
stabilized with emergent HD and returned to the floor. Her 
hyperkalemia was treated with insulin/Calcium. Discharge K 5.8 
after which she received HD. On MWF HD. Access: LUE AVF. 

#Macrocytic Anemia
Most likely secondary to ESRD. MCV 101-102. Folate normal. B12
low-normal 389. Recommend serum or urine MMA as outpatient to 
assess for B12 deficiency as a low normal B12 may still be 
deficient at the tissue level.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Hypertension. Remained hypertensive to 180s, but asymptomatic.
Her home regimen was continued as below: 
On HD days: Hydral 25 BID, labetalol 300 BID
On non-HD days: Hydral 25 TID, labetalol 300 TID, amlodipine 10
On all days: Lisinopril 10
Her lisinopril was increased to 20 mg po daily in light of 
continued high blood pressures. 

#Rheumatoid arthritis 
Initially give 10 mg prednisone po daily and titrated down to 
7.5 mg as per rheumatology recs. 

#COPD on 2L home O2 
There is some concern that her respiratory disease is actually
due to ILD in the setting of her RA. Could consider PFTs as an
outpatient. She received O2 and her home nebulizers

#Hypothyroidism 
She was continued on levothyroxine 125 mcg daily. 

#Anxiety/depression 
She was continued on her home pregabalin, clonazepam, sertraline 
and trazodone. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Please ensure patient completes her 6 week course of 
antibiotics, ___, and follows up with OPAT
[] Please check blood pressure as outpatient, of note blood 
pressures elevated to the 180s and 190s systolic during her 
admission. Consider up titration of her lisinopril as needed.
[] Please check a CBC and BMP to monitor her leukocytosis to 
check for hyperkalemia
[] please check serum or urine methylmalonic acid given 
borderline low Vitamin B12 (389), which may contribute to 
patient's microcytic anemia 
[] Please consider outpatient PFTs to better assess whether her 
lung disease is due to her COPD or ILD secondary to RA, or a 
mixed picture. Also consider a sleep study to r/o OSA. 
[] Please follow-up with OBGYN for uterine mass (fibroid vs. 
polyp) as well cervical stenosis.
[] R lower pole of kidney showing renal cysts, recommend a 
dedicated renal ultrasound to evaluate nonurgently. 
[] Patient reported breaking of lower teeth during this 
admission of unclear etiology. No reported trauma. Attempted to 
obtain a panorex, but patient was unable to tolerate. Please 
consider follow-up outpatient.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN):
1. Moderately distended gallbladder with mural edema and 
dependent stones, 
early acute cholecystitis should be considered. HIDA scan could 
be performed for confirmation if desired. 
2. Cholelithiasis. 

MRCP (MR ABD ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Appearance consistent with hepatic edema, likely hepatitis. 
2. Abnormal gallbladder with marked gallbladder wall edema and 
gallstones, 
but the gallbladder is somewhat decompressed, suggesting this is 
secondary to hepatitis rather than cholecystitis. 
3. No common bile duct stones. 
4. Minimally complex cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney. 
foolow up in 6 months initially with ultrasound is recommended, 
though this may need MRI follow up. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented to the Emergency Department on ___ with acute onset periumbilical pain.  An abdominal 
ultrasound was suggestive of a 
'moderately distended gallbladder with mural edema and dependent 
stones; early acute cholecystitis should be considered' and 
cholelithiasis; LFTs were also elevated upon admission (T. bili. 
2.9)  While in the ED, intravenous fluids, pain/ nausea 
medication and intravenous antibiotics were administered.  He 
was subsequently admitted to the Acute Care Surgical service for 
ongoing management.  

Upon admission, the patient underwent an MRCP for evaluation of 
possible choledocholithiasis given elevated LFTs.  The MRCP was 
notable for 'appearance consistent with hepatic edema, likely 
hepatitis, abnormal gallbladder with marked gallbladder wall 
edema and gallstones' without evidence of common bile duct 
stones.  Additionally, a minimally complex cyst in the lower 
pole of the left kidney was noted with follow recommended in 6 
months. 

On HD2, an ERCP was attempted, but unsuccesssful due to 
Roux-en-Y anatomy.  Post-procedure, the patient's abdominal pain 
improved and LFTs trended downward suggesting passage of stones. 
 He was subsequently taken to the operating room on HD3 where he 
underwent a laparascopic cholecytectomy; see operative note for 
details.  Post-operatively, the patient remained afebrile with 
stable vital signs; intravenous antibiotics were not resumed.  
His diet was advanced to regular and well tolerated.  
Additionally, he was voiding adequately and ambulating 
independently.  He was subsequently discharged to home on POD1 
and will follow-up in ___ clinic in 2 weeks. Of note, while in 
the PACU, a pilonidal cyst without erythema was noted, which per 
patient, is chronic.  The patient was instructed to continue 
current management of dry dressings prn with regular inspection 
of site.  Warning signs were reviewed with patient with 
perceived good understanding. He will follow-up with his primary 
care provider for ongoing management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented to ___ and Delivery on ___ with loss of 
fluids and breech presentation. Decision made at that time to 
proceed with primary low transverse cesarean delivery. 

Postpartum, her course was complicated by preeclampsia, severe 
by blood pressures. Her serum labs were normal and P:C was 0.28 
on ___. On the evening of ___, she had a sustained severe 
blood pressure requiring one dose of fast-acting nifedipine. She 
was started on nifedipine 30mg daily that day, and after 3 days, 
was transitioned to labetalol 200mg q8h and uptitrated to 
labetalol 400mg po q8h starting ___. She remained asymptomatic 
and well throughout this time.

In addition, she had an episode of non-sustained tachycardia 
over the course of ___, for which complete workup, including 
EKG, repeat labs, and CTA were all reassuring. Etiology was 
thought to most likely be reflex tachycardia from nifedipine 
administration or insufficient oral intake.

Her postpartum course was otherwise uncomplicated. Her pain was 
treated with oral pain medications. She was continued on her 
home levothyroxine. She ambulated and her foley was discontinued 
and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was advanced without 
incident. 

By postpartum day 6, her blood pressures were stabilized in the

Output:","The patient is a 38-year-old female who presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of loss of fluids and breech presentation. She is a G1P0 at 38 weeks and 1 day gestation. Her past medical history includes hypothyroidism, prolactinoma, pituitary microadenoma, nephrolithiasis, and abnormal pap smear with +HPV. She has a history of allergies to aspirin.

The patient underwent a primary low transverse cesarean delivery due to breech presentation. Her postpartum course was complicated by preeclampsia, which was managed with nifedipine and labetalol. She also experienced an episode of non-sustained tachycardia, which was thought to be related to reflex tachycardia from nifedipine administration or insufficient oral intake.

The patient was discharged home on postpartum day 6 with a stable condition, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, and pain controlled with oral medications. Her medications at discharge include docusate sodium, ibuprofen, and labetalol."

Output:","The patient is a 75-year-old male who presented with a severe headache and nausea/vomiting after fixing his window at home. He was diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and underwent a cerebral angiogram, which did not reveal any evidence of an aneurysm. The patient was treated with dilantin, but due to low serum levels and a rash, he was switched to Keppra. He also developed a left basilic vein thrombosis and had episodes of intermittent hyponatremia, which were treated with salt tablets.

The patient's past medical history includes diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, cataract surgery, and a non-traumatic retinal detachment. He has allergies to penicillins and Vicodin.

The patient's diagnosis is a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and he underwent a cerebral angiogram to rule out an aneurysm. He was treated with dilantin and later switched to Keppra due to side effects.

The patient underwent a brief hospital course, during which he was monitored for any complications. He was started on a course of dilantin, but due to side effects, he was switched to Keppra. He also developed a left basilic vein thrombosis and had episodes of intermittent hyponatremia, which were treated with salt tablets.

was stable throughout the admission. A repeat renal ultrasound 
showed progression of the hydronephrosis despite a foley 
catheter in place with good return. Cystogram showed a dilated 
collecting system but no ureteral stricture. The patient was 
discharged with a foley in place and urology follow-up the 
following week. He was also discharged to have his renal lytes 
rechecked and with close nephrology follow-up. Terazosin was 
restarted. Lasix and losartan were stopped with the patient to 
take lasix only every ___ day.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___ - 
___ was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for acute kidney failure. We 
placed a foley to help decompress your bladder and kidney 
collecting system. We performed 2 ultrasound studies of your 
kidneys, which both showed swelling and dilation of your kidney 
collecting system. We also performed a cystogram, that did not 
show any damage to the connection between your kidney and 
bladder. Your renal failure was likely caused by a combination 
of medications, dehydration from your recent illness, and 
possibly from an enlarged prostate. You will go home with a 
foley catheter from the hospital and will see a urologist next 
___ to have this foley removed. You will see Dr. ___ 
___ ___. We also started you on a medication to treat your 
enlarged prostate.

We made the following changes to your medications: 
We changed Lasix to 40 mg every ___ day. 
We changed Gabapentin (Neurontin) to 300 mg each day because of 
your renal function
We STOPPED Cozaar (Losartan). You may be told to restart this 
medication once your kidney function returns to normal. 
We STARTED terazosin 3 mg twice per day for your prostate.
We STARTED hydralazine 25 mg three times per day for high blood 
pressure (this will likely be stopped once you can restart 
Cozaar). 
We STOPPED ciprofloxacin.
. 
It is also very important that you have your renal function labs 
performed on this ___ to be sure there is no 
worsening of your kidney function and to be sure that your 
potassium is still within a normal range. These labs can be 
drawn close to home and should be faxed to your primary care 
doctor at ___#: ___ at fax#

Output:","The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted with acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease. He has a history of renal transplant in 2007 for IgA nephropathy and has been non-adherent to his terazosin medication for the past three months. He presented with a two-week history of severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which resolved before admission. His creatinine level was elevated at 4.7, and he was found to have a potassium level of 5.2. He was given kayexelate and maintained a good urine output. The patient's past medical history includes IgA nephropathy, chronic MRSA osteomyelitis, multiple skin cancers, hypertension, enlarged prostate, restless leg syndrome, GERD, gout, hypertriglyceridemia, and anxiety. He was diagnosed with interval progression of severe hydronephrosis of the transplant kidney and cortical thinning. He was treated with a Cudet foley catheter, kayexelate, and hydralazine, and was discharged with a foley in place and urology follow-up. He was also restarted on terazosin and lasix was stopped."
