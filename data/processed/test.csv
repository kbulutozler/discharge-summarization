Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for alcohol detoxification. We treated you 
with medicines to prevent dangerous withdrawal symptoms and side 
effects.

We also had out social worker and addiction specialists work 
with you to come up with a safe plan for discharge to keep you 
sober.  As you know, it is extremely important that you stop 
drinking to prevent the many terrible effects alcohol can have 
on the body.  As we discussed, this will be difficult, but with 
the proper social supports it is something that you have the 
capability to do.  By continuing to drink, you are only 
increasing the chances of death at a young age.
.
We also tested you for HIV and Hepatitis C, both of which were 
negative.  You had some findings in your mouth that may have 
been thrush (a mild infection), so you should finish 5 days of 
nystatin to treat this.  We have also started you on some 
vitamins, which you should continue to take.
.
Please note the following medication changes:
-Please START thiamine
-Please START multivitamin
-Please START folic acid
-Please START nystatin for 2 more days

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 46-year-old male who was admitted for alcohol withdrawal. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has experienced withdrawal seizures in the past. He drinks 16 drinks of vodka daily and had 6 drinks today, which led to symptoms such as insomnia, seeing flashes of ""demonic faces,"" and dreams of being levitated by devils. He was treated with benzodiazepines and had no further seizures in the hospital. His roommate, who was also an inpatient for detox, left the hospital against medical advice to be with him in the emergency department.

The patient's past medical history includes alcohol abuse with a history of withdrawal seizures, foot surgery, and hand surgery. His family history is significant for alcoholism, with his grandfather and many other family members affected.

The patient's physical examination was notable for poor dentition, thrush on his tongue, and a trace fine tremor. His laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, likely due to fatty deposition in the liver.

The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse and was advised to start outpatient treatment within one week of discharge. He was also prescribed medications including folic acid, multivitamins, thiamine, and nystatin oral suspension. ||endoftext||"

statin a beta-blocker for his CAD. Patient continued to complain 
of chest pain, but given the cath results this was thought to be 
unlikely caused by cardiac disease. He had an incidental finding 
of a RUL lung nodule and significant hilar lymphadenopathy. 
Patient reported recent night sweats with unintentional 30-lb 
weight loss. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with hilar lymph node biopsy as an 
outpatient. Additionally, the patient had on-going rectal pain 
due to his ___ wound. Dermatology and colorectal surgery 
were consulted and recommended wound care. Biopsies and further 
work up were deferred for the outpatient setting. Patient also 
developed loose stools with incontinence concerning for C diff 
given history. He was started and discharged with a prescription 
for PO vancomycin. 

  
 # CORONARIES: unknown
 # PUMP: unknown 
 # RHYTHM: sinus    

# NSTEMI: Patient presented with three days of chest pain, peak 
trop 0.3, EKG with <1mm STD in lateral leads. Patient EKG did 
show evidence of old inferolateral infarct. Patient was started 
on a heparin drip for NSTEMI. Chest pain required nitroglycerin 
and intermittently oxycodone/IV morphine for relief. Patient 
underwent coronary catheterization on ___ which revealed 
RCA 60% stenosis and LCx 30% stenosis. No intervention was 
performed. Patient began ASA, Atorvastatin, metoprolol for CAD 
medical management. Following cath, patient continued to have 
chest pain that was largely unchanged. Multiple EKGs pre and 
post cath did not show new changes or signs of ischemia. While 
the patient had documented CAD on cath, it is possible that some 
of his chest pain was also due to demand ischemia given give 
___ wounds. Pain ___ also be due to hilar 
lymphadenopathy found on CTA. Interventional pulmonology was 
consulted, please see explanation below for lung nodule/hilar 
lymphadenopathy.

# Pulmonary nodule: CT chest reveals discrete nodule  in LUL 
that is >2.0cm in diameter.  OSH started CTX and Doxy for CAP on 
___ but this was discontinued on ___ given no suspicion for 
PNA. Patient with reported history 30 pound weight loss, night 
sweats for ___ months. CTA was uploaded to ___ system for 
image review. Per wet read of radiology, most concerning on the 
CTA was significant hilar lymphadenopathy. History is concerning 
for possible lymphoma vs other malignancy vs infectious 
etiology. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with biopsy as an outpatient. Patient 
is scheduled for bronchoscopy on ___. 

# Hydradinitis Suppurative Lesions: Patient with lesions in  
axilla, groin, and perianal area are consistent with the 
distribution seen in hidradinitis suppurativa. He has started to 
see improvement in his right axillary lesion but his perianal 
lesions are unchanged.  Dermatology was consulted for re-biopsy 
of anal wound given concern given differing pathology reports 
and unclear diagnosis given refractory nature of his perianal 
lesion. There was no evidence of infection on exam. Colorectal 
surgery was also consulted who discussed patient case with derm. 
___ wounds are painful and of unclear etiology. DDx 
includes verrucous carcinoma vs pyoderma gangrenosum. Since 
patient had multiple previous biopsies by his outpatient 
dermatologist, the decision was made to defer further biopsies 
and discuss with his primary dermatologist as an outpatient. 
Patient was discharged home with wound care ___ services. Humira 
was restarted on discharge, held in-house. 
 
# Coagulopathy: INR elevated on admission to 1.6.  Liver 
synthetic function wnl.  INR remined stable but elevated 
throughout admission. 

# DMII: On metformin at home. Held metformin in the setting of 
potential cath. Last HbA1C 7.2% ___. Patient was given 
Humalog sliding scale while inpatient and discharged to continue 
home dose of metformin on discharge. 

****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES****
[ ] Follow up C diff studies. Discontinue PO vanc if negative. 
If patient, patient should complete 2 week course
[ ] Incidental nodule and hilar LAD on CT requiring 
bronchoscopy/biopsy. Ensure patient follows up with 
interventional pulmonology. Procedure is scheduled for ___ 
[ ] Did not require cath and chest pain is unlikely cardiac, but 
cath did show CAD; therefore, the patient was started on 
atorvastatin 80mg daily, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 BID and 
aspirin 81mg 
[ ] Patient reported attempting to self-taper his alprazolam. He 
was advised to do this under the guidance of a physician. Please 
follow up his benzo use and desire to taper.
[ ] Please ensure close follow up with outpatient dermatology. 
He has had no improvement on Humira thus far and there is strong 
suspicion that this ___ not be PG. Verrucous carcinoma is a 
likely alternative diagnosis. Colorectal surgery recommended 
repeat biopsy, but ___ derm elected to defer repeat biopsy to 
his outpatient provider.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. You had a rigid 
bronchoscopy (procedure to look in your lungs) with cryptherapy 
and electrocautery to help open your airways and improve your 
breathing. After the procedure you had shortness of breath and 
likely had a blockage of your airway from a mucous plug or blood 
clot. You were admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation 
(breathing mask) and respiratory monitoring. Your breathing 
improved tremendously overnight and your x-ray showed 
improvement. You also received steroids after the procedure, 
which were subsequently stopped. 

The Interventional Pulmonology team was very involved in your 
care, and felt that your breathing was greatly improved and you 
were safe for discharge, with follow-up in clinic in one month 
with a CT scan of your airways. 

We did not change any of your medications. 

Please follow-up at your appointments below.

IMAGING:
==========
Chest PA/lat ___
1. No pneumonia.
2. Opacity in the left lower lung base is likely due to nipple 
shadow,
however, a focal mass cannot be excluded.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Although likely due to nipple shadows, 
re-imaging with conventional chest radiographs are recommended 
for further evaluation of left lower lung opacity.

Paracentesis ___
Technically successful ultrasound-guided therapeutic 
paracentesis, with
removal of 5 L of straw-colored fluid.

Chest Portable ___
nterval extubation.  Decreased lung volumes with patchy 
bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Crowding of 
the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large 
effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal 
contours are likely stable given differences in patient 
positioning and inspiratory effort.

RUQ US ___:
1.  The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.  
2. The liver has a cirrhotic morphology.  No focal lesions seen. 
 
3.  Large volume ascites. 

CXR ___:
___ to ___.  Increasing retrocardiac opacity, 
suggestive of 
pneumonia or aspiration.  Stable right basal atelectasis.  
Moderate 
cardiomegaly persists.  In the interval, the patient has been 
intubated the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 
approximately 6 cm above the carinal. 

CXR ___:
No acute intrathoracic abnormality. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ EtOH cirrhosis MELD 17 complicated by resistant ascites 
requiring q2wk para, 3 cords of grade I varices ___ who is 
actively drinking presented to the ED with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, s/p endoscopy and banding and management of 
abdominal pain.

#Abdominal Pain: likely from ascites on admission, with 
diagnostic paracentesis completed showing no signs of SBP, 
followed by ___ guided therapeutic paracentesis. Abdominal pain 
controlled initially with oxycodone as needed, and then 
transitioned to tramadol. Her hospital course was then notable 
for a rising bilirubin.
Infectious workup was repeated with blood culture, CXR, and 
peritoneal culture which were all unrevealing. She was 
discharged to complete an antibiotic course for SBP prophylaxis 
in the setting of her variceal bleed as well as for her 
enterococcal UTI. She is discharged with instructions for blood 
work within 1 week  and a follow up with her primary 
hepatologist.

# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive at baseline 90/50's. On 
presentation to ED 80/40's; likely from acute blood loss in 
setting of hematemesis and possible GI bleed versus 
decompensated cirrhosis; patient also has ascites on exam 
concerning for an SBP.  Peritoneal fluid w/ 32 WBCs. Patient was 
transfused 4u on ___ and 1u ___ and maintained on levophed 
initially.  Prior to transfer to medicine floor, she was started 
on 10mg TID midodrine.

hematemesis, tarry stools, with a history of 
varices/gastropathy/GAVE. Differential diagnosis includes PUD 
vs. variceal bleeding vs. bleeding from GAVE.  Patient was 
started on SBP prophylaxis with ceftriaxone and started on 
octreotide and PPI gtts. On ___, on admission to ICU, EGD was 
performed; banded 2 grade II/III varices during ICU admission. 
She was treated with Octeride gtt, PPI gtt, SBP with 
ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone was continued for 7 day course. Repeat 
blood counts remained stable and she was asymptomatic with 
orthostatic testing. As her hospital course stabilized, she was 
resumed on furosemide and spironolactone. 

# Urinary Enterococcus: Asymptomatic though in setting of 
hypotension concerning for infection. Patient received empiric 
IV vancomycin (___-), which was continued for a 7 day course 
for complicated UTI (last day ___. 
 
# Cirrhosis: MELD 17 ___ C. ___ be decompensated now 
given worsening BPs. Complicated by ascites, varices, 
encepholpathy, abdominal pain. No history of SBP. On 
lactulose/rifaxmin at home although unclear compliance. Diarrhea 
at baseline. Recent cold, no reversal of sleep/wake. Not 
encepholopathic. Actively drinking; therefore not a transplant 
candidate. Patient was continued on lactulose, rifaximin.  
Patient underwent thepareutic paracentesis in the ICU with 
removal of 3L. The Lasix/sprinolactone in the setting of her 
recent active GI bleeding and hypotension, resumed later on the 
hospital course, along with lactuose and rifaximin.

# Coagulopathy: INR 1.4. Plt 77. Around baseling. Likely 
secondary to liver disease and poor nutrition. 

# Alcohol abuse: About a bottle of wine daily. Last drink day 
prior to admission. Tachycardic and tremulous on exam.  Patient 
was placed on CIWA scale, treatment dose IV thiamine was 
initiated along with IV folate and multivitamin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ and 
underwent a left ___ toe amputation. You have now recovered from 
surgery and are ready to be discharged. Please follow the 
instructions below to continue your recovery:

ACTIVITY:

 No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. 

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
 You may shower when you get home
 No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from 
your date of surgery 

WOUND CARE:
 Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If 
they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for 
staple removal. 
 When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place 
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will 
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these 
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm 
water and soap in the shower.

================================
-While you were admitted, our Vascular Surgeons operated on your 
left thigh and drained the collection there. 
-We gave you IV antibiotics and switched you to oral 
antibiotics.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
=======================================
-Continue to take all of your medications and keep all of your 
appointments as listed below. 
-Importantly, continue taking your antibiotic (Bactrim for your 
left thigh infection). You will need to take this twice a day 
(one in morning, one in evening). 
-Stop taking your atenolol and lisinopril for now. We stopped 
this because your blood pressures were on the lower side. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team 

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted with a chief complaint of left thigh bleeding. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, COPD, and prior DVT. She was previously treated with Lovenox and was admitted to the hospital with an arterial bleed into her thigh, which required embolization of the left medial femoral circumflex artery. The patient's bleeding resolved with the application of Surgicel and direct pressure, but she experienced recurrent bleeding when she got up to use the bathroom. A CT scan revealed a fluid collection with surrounding stranding, consistent with an abscess. The patient was treated with antibiotics and was advised to remain non-weightbearing. She was also prescribed medications including acetaminophen, furosemide, levothyroxine, and valacyclovir.

The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, hypothyroidism, COPD, and prior DVT. She also has a history of breast cancer, asthma, and ocular herpes. Her social history is significant for a motor vehicle accident in which she believes part of her skull was removed.

The patient's physical examination revealed a firm hematoma in her left upper thigh, as well as a chronic appearing wound with no active bleeding. Her vital signs were stable, and her laboratory results showed a decrease in her hemoglobin level. The patient was advised to remain non-weightbearing and to follow up with her primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
====================

Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with DM2, well controlled HLD, 
___ plaque and recent transient left field cut who was 
admitted for further work-up of this event. 

# NEUROLOGY:
He was admitted to the stroke service from ___ to ___ given 
concern that his transient left field cut was related to 
cardioembolic or proximal artery-to-artery embolus. Ultimately 
he was thought to have had a TIA. MRI was negative for stroke. 
TTE showed only preexisting VSD, however TEE showed complex, 
nonmobile atheroma in the aortic arch. Given risk for subsequent 
emboli, discussion was held with the patient, wife, and Dr. 
___ the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation 
vs dual antiplatelet therapy.  The patient chose dual 
antiplatelet therapy and was started on plavix and baby aspirin. 
 His stroke risk factors included hypertension, hyperlipidemia 
(although LDL- 54 well controlled on Crestor), diabetes (A1c 
9.3%).  His home rosuvasation and lantus were continued.  Given 
his recent visual field cut and our imprecise VF impatient 
testing, we advised Mr ___ not to drive until formal VF 
testing is done and there is confirmation that he can respond to 
all parts of his VFs to drive safetly.  A letter to his employer 
was generated, explaining this restriction. 

# ___: 
He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and was 
continued on his home meds: amlodipine, lasix, metoprolol, 
trandolapril, crestor. For his complex atheroma in the aortic 
arch, he was started on asa81 and plavix.

# ENDOCRINE:  
Poorly controlled diabetes, A1c 9.3%. He continued his lantus 
and glipizide.  We discussed the ___ of diet and 
exercise.

====================

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1) Needs formal VF testing prior to returning to driving.
2) Started on plavix & asa 81, but may need to consider systemic 
anticoagulation if further embolic phenomenon
3) Would benefit from ___ visits again in the future.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to 
___.  You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left visual 
field cut resulting from a transient ischemic attack (a mini 
stroke), a condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen 
and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is 
the part of your body that controls and directs all the other 
parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived 
of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
1) high cholesterol including cholesterol in your aorta (large 
vessel leaving your heart
2) high blood pressure
3) diabetes mellitus

We are changing your medications as follows:
1) START Plavix 75mg daily
2) DECREASE your Aspirin dose to only 81mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Because of your visual problems last week, it is important for 
you to have a complete visual field test at your 
ophthalmologists office.  You CANNOT drive until you have this 
test completed and the results are approved by your 
ophthalmologist. 

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 
Followup Instructions:
___

Of note, the patient has had previous visits to the ED as well 
as one hospitalization in ___ for abdominal pain. At her last 
appointment with hepatology in ___, she continued to have 
upper abdominal pain, starting in the left flank with radiation 
to the hypogastrium then right flank. The pain is unrelated to 
bowel habits or intake of food. She had a pelvic US performed, 
which showed a left adnexal mass, which was considered to 
contribute to her pain. She has not followed up with Gyn.  
In the ED, initial vitals were 99.8 111 139/89 18 97%. Exam was 
notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness with pronounced

Plt 89, INR 1.3, ALT 26, AST 70, AP 182, Tbili 1.7, Alb 3.7. UA 
showed few bacteria, neg leuk and neg nitrites. BCx and UCx were 
obtained. CXR and EKG were unremarkable. CT Abd & pelvis showed 
cirrhosis with moderate ascites and mild mural thickening of the 
cecum. Diagnostic paracentesis was normal with 1 PMN. She was 
given 5 mg IV morphine sulfate x2, metronidazole 500mg PO, 
ceftriaxone 1g IV and albumin 5% 25g IV. Shortly after, she 
developed a pruritus throughout her body, but no rash. She

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a PMHx of EtOH cirrhosis, 
diverticulosis, and hypertension p/w progressively worsening 
abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
# ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA: CT scan showed mild colonic edema, 
possibly from infectious colitis vs. portal colopathy. Patient 
did not have any bowel movements for the first 24 hours of 
admission, indicating that CT findings were likely due to portal 
colopathy. Although her stools were loose, she was also taking 
lactulose. Abdominal pain may have been precipitated by 
continued alcohol abuse. Diagnostic para revealed 1 PMN. She was 
initially treated with cipro/flagyl, but patient refused these 
medications, and they were discontinued due to low suspicion of 
infection. She will follow-up with gynecology for possible 
pelvic congestion syndrome, which was noted on CT.  

# CIRRHOSIS: Secondary to alcohol abuse. Complicated by portal 
hypertension and ascites with recent hospitalizations for 
decompensation. No history of SBP, varices, or hepatic 
encephalopathy. Patient continues to drink alcohol despite 
emphasis from outpatient providers to abstain and declined to 
see a social worker during this admission. LFTs are consistent 
with continued alcohol use.   

# ASCITES: CT Abd/Pelvis with moderate ascites. Diagnostic 
paracentesis was negative for SBP. She underwent an 
ultrasound-guided therapeutic para draining 1.25L fluid by ___ on 
___. Her home furosemide and spironolactone were continued.  

# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: No history of hepatic encephalopathy. 
Her home lactulose and rifaximin were continued.   

# ETOH ABUSE: History of withdrawal seizures. She was monitored 
on a CIWA during this admission and required doses of diazepam 
initially. She had no complicated withdrawal sx during this 
admission. Folate and thiamine were continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient was concerned about her reducible umbilical hernia. 
Although she remains very high risk for surgical repair, she 
plans to seek a second opinion as an outpatient. This can be 
addressed at liver clinic followup
- Stool cultures pending on discharge
- Continue to encourage alcohol cessation. Patient declined to 
see a social worker during this admission.
- If she continues to be symptomatic, consider colonoscopy as 
outpatient to evaluate area of colopathy vs. colitis
- F/u with Ob-Gyn to evaluate possibility of pelvic congestion 
syndrome as contributor to her abdominal pain
- Patient should have electrolytes and liver labs checked within 
1 week of discharge, sent to Dr. ___ in the ___,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for abdominal pain and diarrhea. We initially 
treated you with antibiotics, but these were stopped as we had a 
low suspicion for infection. We drew cultures, which did not 
grow anything while you were here, and checked your stool for 
infection. You tested negative for C. diff, a common infection 
that could cause diarrhea. You should follow-up with your 
gynecologist to address other potential causes of abdominal 
pain. You also underwent a paracentesis while you were here to 
remove some fluid from your belly. 

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ team

and probable small effusion. On the left, however, there is 
still extensive opacification consistent with pleural effusion, 
atelectasis, and possibly supervening pneumonia in the 
appropriate clinical setting. 

-___ CT abd: 1. Slight interval decrease in size to partially 
organized intra-abdominal fluid collection within the midline 
abdomen which is of higher density today and may suggest 
decreasing phlegmon or evolving hematoma. A small amount of air 
within this collection is likely related to recent attempted 
aspiration. No new fluid collections or extraluminal oral 
contrast is present. 2. Persistent edema and wall thickening 
involving the visualized large bowel, most pronounced in the 
region of the splenic flexure. Slight interval worsening of 
small bowel wall thickening and mesenteric induration in the 
left upper quadrant. This may reflect postoperative change, 
serositis, and/or tumor infiltration. No bowel obstruction. 3. 
Interval increase in moderate-size simple left pleural effusion 
resulting in complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe. 4. 
Fatty liver. 

-___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, left PICC line 
is in 
unchanged position. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has 
almost 
completely resolved. The pre-existing left pleural effusion 
shows a slightly different distribution but is overall unchanged 
in extent. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac 
atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. 

-___ CT chest: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. Moderate left and 
trace right pleural effusions with overlying pulmonary 
atelectasis. 3. Bilateral prominent hilar lymph nodes as well as 
numerous, though not frankly enlarged upper mediastinal and 
supraclavicular lymph nodes. Close attention to these areas is 
recommended given the history of known malignancy. 

-___ CT abd: Limited study without intravenous or enteric 
contrast 
demonstrating post-operative changes with no definable 
intra-abdominal fluid collection for drainage. 

-___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of 
the 
pre-existing left pleural effusion is unchanged. A minimal right 
pleural 
effusion is newly visualized. Moderate bilateral basal 
atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. 
Unchanged course of the left PICC line. No pulmonary edema. No 
focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia 

-___ CT chest:1. Despite evidence of aspiration, attributable to 
the over distended esophagus, the large areas of consolidation 
at the lung bases, by virtue of their persistence and relative 
homogeneity, are indistinguishable as either atelectasis alone 
or atelectasis and pneumonia. There is no pneumonia in the upper 
or middle lobes. Persistent bilateral pleural effusion, moderate 
on the left and small on the right. 

-___ CT chest, abd and pelvis: 1. No evidence of PE. Mild 
pulmonary edema and increased bilateral pleural effusions. 
Bilateral lower lobe bronchial mucoid impaction and atelectasis; 
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  2. Small bowel 
ileus, with patent ileostomy.  3. Intact ___ pouch, with 
apparent mild wall thickening. Please correlate for inflammatory 
or infectious colitis. 4. Mild ascites, partially loculated in 
anterior omentum. Irregular enhancement may represent 
inflammation or peritoneal metastasis. 5. Emphysema and 
pulmonary hypertension. 

-___ CXR: 1. Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe 
collapse and/or consolidation, similar or possibly slightly 
worse. 2. Interval resolution right effusion, but new plate-like 
right base atelectasis 
.
Tissue biospy pathology:
1.  Right colectomy (A-H):
A.  Focal perforation.
B.  Extensive acute and organizing serositis.
C.  Focal serosal carcinoma consistent with patient's known 
serous ovarian carcinoma.
2.  Terminal ileum, resection (J-L):
Acute and organizing serositis
.
Pleural fluid ___: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with metastatic papillary serous 
ovarian CA who was transferred from ___ with SBO. She had 
exp laparotomy on ___ where a perforated transverse colon was 
found; a R extended hemicolectomy and end ileostomy was 
performed, with L colon no longer in continuity with GI tract. 
This surgery was reported to be uneventful with minimal blood 
loss but some intra-peritoneal intra-peritoneal spillage. She 
was transferred to ICU for post-op monitoring given severity of 
comorbidities.
.
Given the concern for intraoperative spillage, she was started 
on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Fluconazole for planned five day course 
(day ___ this was broadened to Vancomycin, Meropenem, 
Ciprofloxacin and Fluconazole (day ___ when she was found to 
have developed a concomitant pneumonia. Her pain was treated 
with a Dilaudid PCA and she was kept NPO with TPN post-surgery. 
She was also continued on IV Bblocker and IV PPI post surgery.
.
The patient remained hypoxic after her surgery, with high 
supplemental oxygen need, thought to be due to splinting from 
abdominal pain as well as pneumonia; she was treated with 
antibiotics as above. She initially had acute renal failure with 
poor urine output but this improved with volume resuscitation. 
.
This patient has known metastatic ovarian cancer and was on 
weekly Avastin/Taxol prior to GI perforation. She was given one 
dose of neupagen on ___ after surgery; this was stopped after 
discussing with Gyn/Onc. Gyn/Onc will further direct her 
oncologic treatment, with social work and pastoral care 
following. 
.
Patient was transferred to the floor on ___ after oxygen 
requirement was tapered to 6L. Patient was diuresed with IV 
lasix and TPN was halved. She was advanced from clear liquids to 
regular diet over the following two days with TPN discontinued. 
Patient's ostomy showed normal outputs with appropriate gas. On 
___, the superior pole of the abdominal incision was noted 
to be erythematous with clear drainage. 3 staples were removed, 
cultures sent, and wound was packed. Gram stain showed no 
organisms. Wound was monitored and anitbiotics continued. Given 
the appearance of the wound and persistent elevated EBC count, 
CT abdomen was performed to assess for abdominal fluid 
collection which revealed a small anterior fluid collection in 
the superior abdomen. ___ was consulted but the collection was 
too small to drain. Follow up CT scans were performed to see 
progression of collection with gradual resolution noted on 
imaging. Over the next several days, superior abdominal wound 
opened further with fascial dehiscence noted in wound and 
drainage of purulent fluid. Wound was packed with aquacel and 
drainage decreased over time. 

As wound improved, persistent leukocytosis raised concern for 
cdiff colitis. Patient was started on empiric flagyl and a 
sigmoidoscopy was performed to assess remnant colon for 
pseudomembranes, with none seen. Flagyl was stopped once 3 cdiff 
cultures were negative. On ___, patient was complaining of 
significant muscle cramping, refractory to diazepam. One dose of 
tizanidine was given and patient was overly sedated. She was 
monitored closely with no change in respiratory function, though 
she was drowsy. Once tizanidine wore off, she was active with no 
mental slowing. Tizanidine was not given and diazepam was 
stopped.

On ___, patient reported severe dyspnea and tachycardia and a 
CTA chest was performed to rule out PE. Scan was negative and 
patient's dyspnea was releived with nebulizer treatments and 
supplemental oxygen. A similar episode occured on ___, and a 
repeat CTA chest was performed in light of patient's high risk 
due to cancer, and immbolization. Repeat scan was also negative. 
On ___, interventional pulmonology was consulted for 
therapeutic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in hopes of 
improving patient's dyspnea. 400 cc of seroud fluid was drained, 
with no bacterial growth, and chemistries consistent with 
transudate. Her dyspnea improved significantly after this, 
though she occasionally had episodes of dyspnea and tachycardia, 
presumably from anxiety.

Over the next ___ days, patient's leukocytosis stabilized around 
16 and her oxygen requirement resolved. She worked with physical 
therapy and po intake was encourage. 
Calorie count revealed inadequate calories intake. Her nutrition 
was supplemented with ensure shakes. 

At discharge, pt felt well. She was discharged on hospital 
day#28/post-operative day #26 in stable condition: afebrile, 
able to eat regular food, under adequate pain control with oral 
medications, and ambulating with ___ and urinating without 
difficulty.

Discharge Instructions:
___ were admitted to the hospital after emergency surgery for 
your colon perforation from your ovarian cancer. ___ have 
recovered from this procedure well and ___ are now ready to 
finish your recovery in rehab. 

___ have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed 
with staples. This incision can be left open to air or covered 
with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become 
irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until 
your first post-operative visit at which time they can be 
removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please 
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if ___ develop a 
fever. Please call the office if ___ develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.  ___ may 
shower and let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel; do not rub.

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___ may 
gradually increase your activity as tolerated but avoid heavy 
exercise. 

___ may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take 
more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while 
taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive 
a car while taking narcotic pain medication.

___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a 
new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the 
stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is 
very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large 
intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed 
into the body and the stool becomes formed. ___ must measure 
your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from 
the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If 
___ find that your output has become too much or too little, 
please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse 
practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the 
ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated. If ___ notice 
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink 
such as gatoraide. Please monitor yourself for signs and 
symptoms of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon 
standing), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If ___ 
notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the 
emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ 
may eat a modified regular diet with your new ileostomy.

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care 
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ stoma 
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be 
beefy red or pink. It may ooze small amounts of blood at times 
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around 
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the 
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed 
above. Please care for the ostomy as ___ have been instructed by 
the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ will be able to make an appointment 
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic after surgery. ___ will have 
nurses at rehab for the next few weeks helping to monitor your 
ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own.

Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual 
activities. Good luck!
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 58-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. She had a history of recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer and had undergone multiple surgeries and chemotherapy treatments. She was initially diagnosed with stage IIC ovarian cancer and had received carboplatin and Taxol therapy until she developed a carboplatin allergy. She was then switched to Doxil and later started on Arimidex. She had been stable until she developed abdominal pain, concern for acute appendicitis, and underwent laparoscopic evaluation, which revealed several carcinoma implants along both hemidiaphragms, the right lobe of the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and appendix.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy and end ileostomy. She was found to have small bowel pneumatosis and was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for sepsis. She was also found to have rising CA-125 levels and was initiated on carboplatin therapy. However, she developed a carboplatin allergy and was switched to Doxil.

The patient's past medical history is significant for recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer, osteopenia, and a family history of CAD and ovarian cancer. Her physical exam revealed abdominal tenderness, absent bowel sounds, and a Foley catheter in place draining clear urine.

The patient's discharge medications included vanc/zosyn, and her discharge labs showed elevated WBC count, AST, and ALT levels. Her imaging studies revealed a partially rim-enhancing fluid collection within the anterior midline abdomen, no findings of bowel obstruction or leak, and bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.

In summary, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer who underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy and end ileostomy due to abdominal pain and concern for acute appendicitis. She was found to have small bowel pneumatosis and was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for sepsis. She was also found to have rising CA-125 levels and was initiated on carboplatin therapy, but developed a carboplatin allergy and was switched to Doxil. ||endoftext||"

IMAGING AND STUDIES

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is 
normal left ventricular wall thickness with anormal cavity size. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. However, 
the inferior wall ishypokinetic. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no resting 
leftventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade II 
diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricularcavity size with 
normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal.The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
Theaortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta 
diameter. There is no evidence for anaortic arch coarctation. 
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. There is 
SEVERE aortic valvestenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or less). There 
is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildlythickened. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspidvalve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimatedpulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

CAROTID US ___
Right ICA <40% stenosis. 
Left ICA <40% stenosis. 
Delayed upstroke in the bilateral ICAs, and more subtle delay in 
the CCA is most likely due to known known severe aortic 
stenosis. 
There is significant calcification artifact in the proximal 
right ICA thus the severity of stenosis may be underestimated, 
consider cross-sectional imaging if concerning symptoms are 
present. 

ANKLE 3 VIEWS ___
No acute fractures or dislocations are seen. There are mild 
degenerative 
changes of the anterior tibiotalar joint with spurring.  
Vascular 
calcifications are seen.There are calcaneal spurs.  There are 
mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of the talonavicular 
joint.  There is mild overall demineralization.

HD, HTN who presents after syncopal episode likely due to vagal 
episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention 
for severe aortic stenosis (EF 60%, peak vel 4.4m/sec, peak 
gradient 77mgHg, mean gradient 45mm, valve area 0.8cm2 ___ 
dimensionless index 0.20; per ___ TTE dimensionless index was 
0.25)
[] continue hemodialysis MFW via fistula
[] consider stopping metoprolol tartrate in setting of EF 60%, 
dose was decreased from 25 mg twice daily to 12.5 mg twice daily 
during this admission (due to bradycardia)
[] stopped Imdur due to lower BPs and severe AS

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# syncopal episode
# severe aortic stenosis
Likely vagal in etiology, but concerning in the context of 
severe aortic stenosis (EF 60%, peak vel 4.4m/sec, peak gradient 
77mgHg, mean gradient 45mm, valve area 08cm2). It is unknown how 
long this patient has had this for and at which severity was 
this last classified. Patient does remember having an 
echocardiogram done ___, but recalls no plans to intervene. 
Telemetry during admission only pertinent for slightly prolonged 
PR interval and mild bradycardia. Carotid ultrasound revealed 
not clinically significant stenosis of both carotid arteries, 
less than 40% stenosis. Patient is to immediately report to 
___'s emergency room with the help of his 
daughters once landing in ___ as he is adamant about not 
wanting to undergo work up and intervention here in ___ due 
to insurance costs and understandably being away from 
home/support. He understands the risks involved in this plan 
including delaying of care and potential mortality, and is 
willing to accept them.

TTE ___
Conclusion: The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. 
There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal 
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is

resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade 
II diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricular cavity size 
with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
The aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending 
aorta diameter. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. 
There is SEVERE aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or 
less). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is an 81-year-old male who presented with a syncopal episode after a baseball game. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), and atrial fibrillation (Afib). He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were notable for a temperature of 97.2°F, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 151/48 mmHg. His physical examination revealed a bradycardic rhythm, normal rhythm, and a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium.

Laboratory results showed elevated levels of troponin (0.53 ng/mL) and creatinine (11.0 mg/dL), as well as mild anemia (Hgb 11.3 g/dL). Imaging studies revealed severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0 cm² or less, as well as mild degenerative changes in the ankle joints.

The patient was prescribed medications at discharge, including Eliquis for Afib and metoprolol tartrate for hypertension. He was also advised to undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention for severe aortic stenosis, continue hemodialysis three times a week, and consider stopping metoprolol tartrate due to bradycardia.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was marked by a syncopal episode likely due to a vagal episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis, and he was discharged with recommendations for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||"

CT Abdomen and Pelvis (IV Contrast):
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. Atelectasis within the lingula is additionally 
noted. 
An amorphous area low attenuation is identified within segment 
IVb of the 
liver. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, 
spleen, 
pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear within normal 
limits. The 
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally. A 
3-cm low- 
attenuation lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney is 
consistent with a simple cyst. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
of the infrarenal abdominal aorta is evident.   
There is thickening of the cecum and significant pericecal 
stranding of 
mesenteric fat. Surgical clips at the site of appendectomy are 
noted. No 
evidence of abscess or loculated fluid. A small amount of free 
fluid in this area, which also tracks down into the pelvis is 
seen. Although the distal ileum is not well distended with oral 
contrast, there is a suggestion of bowel wall thickening/edema 
and stranding of the surrounding mesenteric fat. No organized 
fluid collection is evident, however. There is no evidence of 
bowel obstruction as contrast has passed through to the rectum. 
There is no free air within the abdomen. Although the colon is 
not distended, there is a suggestion of diffuse colonic wall 
thickening. 
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, 
intrapelvic 
loops of small bowel are unremarkable. A Foley balloon is 
present within a 
decompressed bladder. A small amount of free fluid is evident 
within the 
pelvis. Small, bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are 
evident. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Inflammatory process appears to be centered in the ileocecal 
area at the site of recent appendectomy. No organized or 
drainable intra-abdominal fluid collection. Assessment is 
somewhat limited by lack of distal ileal distention with oral 
contrast. A small amount of free fluid and scattered subjacent 
lymph nodes are additionally evident.  
2. Equivocal diffuse colonic wall thickening. This finding 
raises the 
possibility of colitis and and infectious process such as C. 
difficile should be considered.   
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal 
akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the 
basal half of the inferior wall. There is minimal hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %). The estimated cardiac 
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w ischemia. Left pleural effusion. 
.
ECG ___: normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in 
leads III, AVF
.
PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
final blood cultures from ___ (no growth to date)
stool cultures, O&P from ___. SEPSIS:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an outside hospital with 
hypotension, on Levophed with an elevated WBC count of 22.6 on 
admission.  The source of infection was not clear on admission 
and differential included infection from recurrent abscesses at 
appendectomy site or C. Diff colitis.  Other etiology considered 
was reaction to CT contrast.  Was started on Vanocmycin, Zosyn 
and Flagyl in the MICU.  He remained hemodynamically stable and 
afebrile and Levophed was stopped on the day of transfer for 
MAP>65, SvO2 72, CVP 6 and good urine output.  CT showed 
inflammation prior appendectomy site without fluid collection.  
Surgery was consulted and did not recommend surgery.  
Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended 48 hours of IV 
antibiotics for presumed GI infection, then 3 weeks of PO 
antibiotics.  Cultures were obtained on ___ from ___ 
___ and showed no growth to date of blood or urine 
cultures.  Blood and urine cultures collected at ___ 
showed no growth to date.  C. Diff X 3 were negative.  The 
patient continued to do well and was trasnferred to the general 
medical floor on ___.  He was continued on IV antibiotics 
and then changed to PO antibiotics on ___.  He was put on 
Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID and Metronidazole 500mg PO TID and 
was discharged with 16 more days of antibiotics.  He will 
___ with his PCP ___ 1 week.  Another possible etiology for 
his symptoms that was considered was anaphylaxis from PO 
contrast from the CT scan, although this was less likely given 
that he has had PO contrast in the past without problems.  We 
recommended that he see an allergist as an outpatient to assess 
the possibility of an allergic reaction to PO contrast.
.
2. NSTEMI
The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes with a CK 
of 133, CKMB 19, Troponin T 0.29 and T-wave inversions in leads 
III and AVL.  Cardiology was called and thought this was likely 
rate-related demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia due 
to sepsis physiology.  Cardiac enzymes trended down and 
___ ECGs showed no change.  The patient's tachycardia 
improved with IV fluids and antibiotics.  He was asymptomatic 
during his admission.  He was put on telemetry and had no events 
or arrythmias.  An echocardiogram showed global reduced 
function, EF 45% and focal akinesis of basal inferior wall.  
Aspirin 325mg PO qday and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID were started 
for NSTEMI.  Cardiology did not recommend heparin or 
anti-platelet agents.  Cardiology recommended a ___ echo 
and cardiologist appointment within 4 weeks after his acute 
illness had resolved. The patient will have this scheduled with 
his primary care doctor.  He remained asymptomatic with no chest 
pain or signs of clinical heart failure.
.
3. EOSINOPHILIA
The patient's WBCs trended down from admission from 22.6 to 
11.8.  He had 23% bands on admission which resolved by 
discharge.  His eosinophil count was 0 on admission, however on 
___ he had 32% eosinophils, on ___ had 38% eosinophils, and 
on ___ had 36% eosinophils.  This corresponds to an absolute 
eosinophil count of 3680 on ___, 4294 on ___, and 4248 on 
___.  He had no signs of drug reaction, no fevers, skin rashes 
or other symptoms.  His diarrhea had improved over the course of 
admission but was still having ___ bowel movements per day.  His 
stool was checked for C. Diff and was negative X 3.  Ova and 
parasites and fecal stool cultures were pending at the time of 
discharge.  It was recommended that he see an allergist for 
discussion and testing for reaction to PO contrast from the CT 
scan.
.
4. DIARRHEA
Most likely etiology is antibiotic-associated as the patient has 
been on antibiotics off and on for the past several weeks.  His 
diarrhea was at times watery, but improved through admission and 
was described as loose stool at the time of discharge.  
Clostridium Difficile was checked X 3 and was negative.  He was 
discharged with Cipro and Flagyl for his antibiotic regimen.  He 
will ___ with his PCP with any further problems.  His 
final stool cultures are still pending at the time of discharge.
.
5. ANXIETY
The patient was anxious during his hospitalization regarding his 
medical condition and etiology of his sepsis.  He was given 
Ativan 0.5mg PRN for anxiety symptoms.  He was given Trazodone 
25mg PO qHS to help with sleep.  
.
6. PROPHYLAXIS
Mr. ___ was given SC Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  He was 
able to tolerate a regular diet on ___.  
.
His symptoms improved and he was discharged with close PCP 
___ and instructions to ___ with cardiology as 
arranged by his PCP.  He was also recommended to see an 
allergist on discharge for ___ of this episode as a 
potential reaction to PO contrast from the CT scan.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the 
gynecology service after undergoing and IV guided drainage of a 
tuboovarian abscess noted on her left adnexa. Please see the 
operative report for full details.

Her immediate post op course was complicated by low grade fevers 
on post-operative day 1 and 2 and IV antibiotics were broadened 
to include gentamycin, clindamycin, and ampicillin. On post-op 
day 2, patient had an elevated WBC with increasing left shift 
and repeat pelvic ultrasound and CT pelvis with contrast was 
performed. Imaging was notable for a decreased left adnexal 
fluid collection of 3cm (decreased from 6cm on admission) and a 
new right rim-enhancing 1.3cm and 0.9 collection on the right 
adnexa. Interventional radiology was re-consulted but given 
improvement of WBC count and clinical improvement, additional 
drainage deferred. On post-op day 3, she was transitioned to PO

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who initially presented 
with severe abdominal pain. At that time, no obvious findings on 
CT scan and no obvious leak was appreciated. Given her pain and 
significant CT findings, it was decided that she would benefit 
from a diagnostic laparoscopy. At that time, I was concerned 
that she may actually have a gastric perforation and may have a 
gallbladder issue that could potentially be addressed 
laparoscopically. Thus, we decided to start the case 
laparoscopically with potential conversion to an open procedure 
if a significant
lesion in the stomach was appreciated. The risks and benefits of 
the procedure were described in detail to the patient. Despite 
these risks, she chose to proceed with surgery. She was found to 
have a gastric perforation and therefore converted to 
exploratory laparotomy with ___ patch and placement of a 
Pravena vac. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a IV dialudid 
PCA and then transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone 
once tolerating a diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression and nasojejunal 
tube in place for feeding.  On POD2 tube feeding were started 
through the doboff. On POD3 the NGT was accidently  removed by 
the patient when sneezing. She was kept NPO (except tube feeds). 
On POD5 she underwent upper GI leak test that was unclear and 
therefore was repeated on POD7 and negative for leak. Doboff was 
removed and she was given a regular diet with good tolerability. 
H.Pylori result was positive and therefore she was started on 
quadruple therapy once tolerating a diet. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. H.Pylori quadrupal therapy 
started and prescribed 2 week course. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Brief Hospital Course:
On evening of admission, prior fem-fem cutdown site was probed 
by Fellow, who was easily able to palpate the graft. The 
following day, a wound vac was placed on this site. Pt's ray 
incision was packed with iodoform. A LLE ultrasound was obtained 
to evaluate pt's asymmetrical edema and was negative for DVT.   
Pt was seen by her outpt Cardiologist, who recommended a family 
meeting and palliative care consult should pt require a major 
operation. 
On HD 4, a CTA was obtained and demonstrated decreased fluid 
around the graft and an open bypass graft with flow to the foot. 
That night, she tripped on her vac and began to complain of L 
leg pain. 
The following day, pt continued to complain of L leg pain as 
well as SOB. She spiked another fever. Bcx was again sent and a 
CXR demonstrated diffuse interstital edema and small pleural 
effusions. The next day, pt's SOB resolved but her L leg pain 
persisted. Another LLE US found no DVT and a knee x-ray did not 
demonstrate any acute findings. During a vac change, fluid was 
sent and grew E.coli. 
The next day, HD 7, pt's leg pain persisted. Pain meds were 
increased. X-rays from the pelvis down were obtained; they 
showed osteopenia but no fractures or dislocations. A blister 
was noted of the dorsum of her left foot and her antibiotics 
were changed to vancomycin and zosyn (from vanc/cipro/flagyl) to 
better cover streptococcus. The following day the pt's leg pain 
was somewhat improved but the blister on her foot had enlarged. 
A CT scan was obtained and showed edema but no air or abscesses. 

On HD 9, pt's LUE AV graft was unable to be accessed at HD. The 
following day, Interventional Radiology performed a successful 
thrombectomy and venoplasty. On HD 10, a foot XRay was taken, 
which demonstrate a non-displaced ___ metatarsal fracture. 
Podiatry was consulted and recommended no intervention and 
heel-touch only weight bearing status in the left side. The do 
not believe the left foot blister and residual wound is related. 
On HD ___, antibiotic coverage was adjusted to allow for dosing 
only with dialysis, for ease of administration outside the 
hospital. On HD ___ arrangements were made for the patient to be 
discharged to rehab. At the time of discharge, her pain was 
controlled, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding and 
moving her bowels spontaneously. She was sitting up in a chair 
for the large part of the day, but was not yet moving around on 
her own. She should continue physical therapy in rehab to work 
on regaining her mobility.

RADIOLOGY
=========
___ 10:12 AM ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)   
FINDINGS:  
Multiple air-fluid levels are seen the right upper and left 
upper quadrant with gaseous distended small and large bowel.  
There may be sigmoid colonic gas.  Pneumobilia is again noted.  
Gastrostomy tube and surgical clips noted in the mid abdomen.  
Densities overlying the lower lumbar vertebral bodies are likely 
from prior vertebroplasties. 
IMPRESSION:  
Bowel gas pattern could represent obstruction or ileus.  
Additional evaluation with CT scan can be considered. 

___ 12:___BD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST   
FINDINGS:  
LOWER CHEST: Bibasilar atelectasis is mild. There is no evidence 
of pleural or pericardial effusion. 
ABDOMEN: 
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions.  Pneumobilia 
is slightly decreased from prior.  Mild intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation is again seen.  The CBD measures up to 1.2 cm (02:18) 
without evidence of choledocholithiasis.  There is air in the 
gall bladder lumen, without stones or gallbladder wall 
thickening. 
PANCREAS: Fatty infiltration of the pancreas seen.  There is no 
evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  
There is no peripancreatic stranding. 
SPLEEN: Splenomegaly is unchanged.  The spleen shows normal 
attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. 
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape. 
URINARY: 1.1 cm right upper pole cortical hypodensity (02:27) is 
unchanged. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of stones or 
hydronephrosis. There are no urothelial lesions in the kidneys 
or ureters. There is no perinephric abnormality. 
GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a small hiatal hernia.  Gastrostomy 
tube tip is in the jejunum.  The patient is status post 
ileocecectomy.  Lack of wall to wall filling of the distal small 
bowel and subsequent apparent wall thickening is likely due to 
mixing artifact. Distal small bowel loops are somewhat dilated, 
up to 3.2 cm, however contrast material is seen in the ascending 
colon and there is air and stool in the colon more distally. 
Colon and rectum are within normal limits.  Prominent mesenteric 
lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT size threshold for 
lymphadenopathy. 
RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy. 
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is 
moderate calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great 
abdominal arteries.  There is a replaced right hepatic artery. 
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. 
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Penile calcifications are again seen.   
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: 
There is no evidence of suspicious lesions.  Osteopenia is 
noted. Multilevel vertebroplasty and right femoral hardware are 
unchanged.  Old gastrostomy tube tract is seen. Right inguinal 
hernia containing fat is again seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Distal small bowel loops are mildly dilated, but enteric 
contrast is seen in the ascending colon and there is air and 
stool in the colon more distally, more suggestive of mild ileus 
rather than bowel obstruction. 
2. Lack of wall to wall filling with oral contrast of the distal 
small bowel and resultant apparent wall thickening is likely due 
to mixing artifact. 
3. The common bile duct measures up to 1.2 cm without evidence 
of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.  Pneumobilia and mild 
intrahepatic biliary dilation are again seen, consistent with 
prior sphincterotomy. 
4. Splenomegaly is unchanged. 
5. 1.1 cm right renal hypodensity is unchanged.  Continued 
attention is recommended on future exams. 

___ 2:46 ___ ESOPHAGUS
FINDINGS:  
Esophagus was not dilated and no extrinsic mass was identified.  
The esophageal mucosa appears normal. 
The primary peristaltic wave was broken in the mid esophagus 
with many tertiary contractions.  An 13 mm barium tablet was 
administered with a few seconds of hold up in the lower 
esophagus, reproducing the patient's symptomatology.  The pill 
passed into the stomach uneventfully with termination of the 
patient's symptoms. 
Limited visualization of the stomach is unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Esophageal dysmotility with prominent tertiary waves, 
consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm.
2.  The patient's symptomatology was reproduced momentarily 
while the barium tablet passed through the gastroesophageal 
junction. 

___ 10:41 AM CHEST (PA & LAT)   
FINDINGS:  
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is a right-sided 
PICC line with tip in the distal SVC.  There is volume loss/ 
infiltrate in the left lower lobe that is new compared to prior 
again seen and more conspicuous than on the prior study are 
multiple mildly dilated loops of bowel.  The patient had a 
contrast-enhanced CT 1 day ago and therefore there is contrast 
outlining many of these loops of bowel.  However with unusual is 
that in many areas it appears that both the inside and outside 
of the bowel wall is visualized.  There is no other evidence of 
free air and therefore this is likely an artifact of the manner 
in which the contrast has been distributed   
IMPRESSION:  
Volume loss/ infiltrate in the left lower lobe mildly dilated 
loops of small bowel with unusual appearance to the bowel wall.  
A followup upright film to exclude free air would be helpful 

___ 1:03 ___ ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)   
FINDINGS:  
Again seen is contrast outlining bowel loops.  At this point in 
time most of contrast is in the colon.  There are multiple 
air-fluid levels in the small bowel which is nondilated.  A 
gastric tube is visualized pneumobilia is present no free air is 
identified   
IMPRESSION:  
Ileus versus partial SBO 

___ 3:44 ___ UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT   
FINDINGS:  
There is normal flow with respiratory variation in the bilateral 
subclavian veins. 
The right internal jugular and axillary veins are patent and 
compressible with transducer pressure. 
The right brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins are patent, 
compressible with transducer pressure and show normal color flow 
and augmentation.  A PICC is seen in a right brachial vein.   
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper 
extremity. 

PATHOLOGY
=========
___ GASTROINTESTINAL MUCOSAL BIOPSY
1.Terminal ileum, biopsy:
- Chronic mildly active ileitis.
2.Colon, ulcer, biopsy:
- Colonic mucosa with ischemic-type injury and fibrinopurulent 
exudate consistent with ulceration; see note.
3.Colon, random, biopsy:
- Colonic mucosa within normal limits.
Note: The differential diagnosis includes local effect of the 
anastomotic site, certain infections (C. difficile, 
enterohemorrhagic E. coli), primary vascular, or drug induced 
etiologies (e.g. NSAID's). No granulomata or dysplasia 
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of diabetes 
type 2 uncontrolled complicated by neuropathy, Crohn's disease 
s/p ileocecectomy and multiple laparotomies for SBO, chronic 
diarrhea and recurrent pseudo-obstructions prompting venting 
G-Jtube, admitted ___ w diarrhea and abdominal distention 
thought to represent partial small bowel obstruction, with long 
hospital course course notable for intermittent intolerance of 
tube feeds, subsequently requiring initiation of TPN after long 
discussions with patient and GI service, now tolerating well, 
having regular bowel movements without signs of obstruction or 
diarrhea, discharged home with TPN; 

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Intermittent Small Bowel Obstructions / Diarrhea / Abdominal 
pain / Crohn's Disease / Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth - 
On presentation, the patient had acutely worsened diffuse 
chronic abdominal pain on presentation. Subsequent workup 
supported multifactorial causes including likely intermittent 
partial small bowel obstructions, osmotic diarrhea from dietary 
indiscretions (eating lots of starburst candies) and Crohn's 
disease.  Initial concern was for SBO. He had a CT with PO and 
IV contrast that showed mild ileus. However, there was some 
thickening of the bowel wall that initially raised concern for 
Crohn's flare (on subsequent revised read, the thickening was 
deemed artifact). Subsequently, he had a colonoscopy that showed 
ulceration at his colonic-colonic anastomosis with biopsies 
showing terminal ileum inflammation. Given that the results were 
suggestive of Crohn's, the patient was started on budesonide 9mg 
PO daily. Furthermore, in working up his diarrhea, which 
improved with no oral intake, he was found to have a stool Osm 
gap of 357-2*(70+24.3) = 168, which suggested an osmotic 
diarrhea. When tube feed was initiated (see below), his diarrhea 
worsened to over 10 times overnight. Eventually, given that he 
had a borderline SIBO breath test in the past, he was started on 
rifaximin empirically for SIBO treatment. When he started TPN 
(see below), his diarrhea improved to 4 BMs per day.

# Acute Protein Calorie Malnutrition - Patient with > 20lb weigh 
loss over last 6 months.  He had intermittent symptoms as above, 
but failed trials of starting on tube feed on 4 separate 
attempts due to abdominal pain, distension and diarrhea.  He was 
tried on several formulations without improvement. Patient 
educated on risks/benefits of TPN.  Ultimately, he was started 
on TPN via R PICC access. He will eventually need consideration 
for a Port-A-Cath if he is to continue TPN long term--given the 
uncertainty about how long he would require TPN, port not placed 
this admission.  He tolerated TPN well with no electrolyte 
abnormalities and signs of refeeding syndrome. He was giving 
thiamine intermittently throughout his hospitalization with 
tubefeed and TPN. 

# Dysphagia | Esophageal Spasm - The patient reported 
significant swallowing issues during his stay and refused to 
take in POs, including pills. He had a barium swallow study that 
showed findings consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm. GI 
consult team wanted to follow up with manometry testing as 
outpatient before starting therapy. Fortunately, his symptoms 
improved during the course of his stay, and he requested 
trialing PO food and was able to tolerate small amount of POs on 
discharge.

# Chronic Back Pain | Chronic Abdominal Pain - Due to NPO 
status, he was given IV hydromorphone in place of his PO regimen 
at home for the most part of his stay. The patient requested on 
multiple occasions to speak with the Pain specialists here. The 
Pain Consult team saw the patient and recommended uptitration of 
gabapentin to 900mg TID for chronic pain and maintaining his 
home narcotics regimen. The team discussed with the patient that 
his abdominal pain can possibly be attributed to his high 
narcotics requirement leading to narcotics bowel syndrome. The 
patient was very reluctant to the idea of decreasing his pain 
medications, stating that without them, he cannot have a normal 
life and wants to have a life. He was discharged on his home 
regimen, but with the understanding that if abdominal symptoms 
should recur or persist, he may need to consider downtitration 
of opiates. He reported needing more hydromorphone despite 
having filled a recent prescription for a 1 month supply only 2 
weeks prior to admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension: The patient's BPs had been well controlled 
throughout his admission up until the last part of his stay, 
when he had elevated BPs to 180s at times. His home labetalol 
regimen was uptitrated to 400mg TID from 300mg TID. It's 
possible this is due to switching from IV hydromorphone to PO.

# COPD: No symptoms while hospitalized. He continued home 
inhaler regimen. 

# Diabetes Mellitus: Complicated by neuropathy. Patient endorsed 
neuropathic pain in his feet. He continue home Gabapentin liquid 
as tolerated.

# Coronary Artery Disease: He had no symptoms. He continued ASA 
and labetalol. Lisinopril was DC'ed as outpatient due to labile 
blood pressures.
  
# Anxiety/Depression: The patient's overall mood was stable but 
he became tearful at times when discussing his chronic illness. 
He continue home lorazepam, buproprion, and buspirone.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- TPN: Will need ongoing evaluation of his nutritional 
requirement.
- Access: Patient currently has a PICC for TPN administration. 
If he will be on TPN for a long time, please consider placing a 
Port for longer term access.
- Antibiotics: Will need to continue taking rafaximin 550mg PO 
TID for 7 days, until ___.
- Pain: Patient has been having ongoing issues with abdominal 
pain. His gabapentin was uptitrated to 900mg TID per the 
recommendations of Pain consult team.
- Hypertension: Patient's BP was low earlier during stay but 
became elevated towards the end (160s), likely due to no longer 
receiving IV pain medication. His labetalol was uptitrated to 
400mg TID. Please consider another antihypertensive agent since 
his heart rate is only ___ at discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after having increasing difficulty 
with maintaining nutrition at home and increasing abdominal 
pain. We performed a CT scan that ruled out a small bowel 
obstruction. We performed a colonoscopy that showed inflammation 
at your anastamosis site, for which we are treating you with 
budesonide, an oral steroid. Furthermore, for your difficulty 
swallowing, we found some signs of esophageal dysmotility on a 
barium study. Fortunately, your symptoms improved without any 
intervention.

Despite our best attempts to start nutrition with tube feed, we 
were unsuccessful. Therefore, we eventually decided to start 
total parenteral nutrition, which you will need to continue on 
until you are able to better tolerate eating by mouth. Last, we 
tried to optimize your diarrhea by trialing you on an 
antibiotics to treat bacteria overgrowth in the small bowel.

Your blood pressure was elevated towards the end of your 
hospitalization. We increased your home dose of labetalol, and 
you will need to follow up with Dr. ___ further 
titration.

Please check your finger sticks at home so that we can monitor 
your glucose level and determine whether you need insulin in 
your TPN.

It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the best!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of weight loss. He has a history of Crohn's disease, multiple laparotomies, and short gut syndrome, which has led to complications such as intermittent small bowel obstruction and dependence on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He also has a history of chronic abdominal pain, depression, and anxiety. On admission, his physical examination revealed a diffusely tender abdomen with mild rebound tenderness, and his laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein. He was diagnosed with a possible small bowel obstruction and was treated with nebulizer therapy and oral steroids. At discharge, his vital signs were stable, and his physical examination revealed a mild firmness and diffusely tender abdomen. His laboratory results showed improvement in his white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, but his albumin and calcium levels remained low. He was prescribed medications for his chronic pain and was advised to follow up with his primary care physician.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female who comes to see 
Dr.
___ for second opinion. She developed illness in ___ 
___ where abnormal CXR led to CT chest which was followed since
every six months revealing in ___ stable bilateral
parenchymal nodules. A persistent soft tissue density in left
posterobasal segment bronchus was seen, along with left thyroid
stable hypodense nodules. This prompted further workup with
bronchoscopy on ___ revealing a left posterior basal segment
nodular endobronchial lesion. This was positive for carcinoid.
LLL BAL was negative. The pateint refused early bronchoscopy in
___ due to ""nerves"". Also noted on bronch was a posterior
tracheal wall invagination or submucosal nodule, and stenosis of
the right middle lobe. 
She underwent further evaluation with PET CT ___ which was
negative for uptake. MR neck was done on ___ to further
identify the subcarinal lesion in trachea, which was not 
biopsied
during bronch due to concern for bleeding. The MR revealed no
upper tracheal mass below the right vocal cords. There appeared
to be slight asymmetry and fullness in the region of the right
palatine tonsil to the right of the uvula and soft palate of
unknown significance. Visual inspection was recommended. An
enhancing left thyroid lesion corresponds to the hypodense 
nodule
on CT chest ___. No further diagnostic workup was done on her
thyroid.

The patient suffers from anxiety which she reports gives her
cough, palpitations and GI complaints. Once she is calm she

CXR ___: FINDINGS: No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is 
within normal limits. Left chest tube is in place without 
pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with 
atelectasis and effusion, though in the appropriate clinical 
setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. 
Minimal opacification obscuring the right heart border could 
represent atelectasis or developing middle lobe consolidation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic surgery service on 
___ and had a left basilar segmentectomy.  The patient 
tolerated the procedure well. 
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA 
with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral 
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: Pulmonary toilet including incentive spirometry and 
early ambulation were encouraged.  The patient was stable from a 
pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, 
voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for an elective resection of a left lower lobe carcinoid tumor. She has a history of anxiety, which causes her to experience symptoms such as cough, palpitations, and gastrointestinal complaints. She also has a history of migraine with aura, hemorrhoids, and retinal detachment. The patient has allergies to iodine and latex.

The patient underwent a left video-assisted basilar segmentectomy and tolerated the procedure well. She was given pain medication and was able to transition to oral pain medication. The patient was also given prophylactic heparin and was encouraged to ambulate and get up as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile, and tolerating a regular diet. She was prescribed several medications, including acetaminophen, losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, fluticasone, simvastatin, omeprazole, oxycodone, lorazepam, docusate sodium, magnesium hydroxide, and zolpidem.

The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up with her doctor if she experiences any symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain. She was also advised to take acetaminophen for pain and to avoid lifting heavy objects or engaging in strenuous activities until her incision has fully healed. ||endoftext||"
