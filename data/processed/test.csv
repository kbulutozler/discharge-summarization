Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, he underwent living donor renal transplant with 6 
___ double J ureteral stent. Of note the venous anastomosis 
was redone intra op. The kidney was making urine. Surgeon was 
Dr. ___. Please refer to operative note further details. 
He received induction immunosuppression which consisted of ATG, 
Cellcept and Solu-Medrol. Prograf was started. 

Postop overnight, urine output decreased to 35 and SBP was in 
low ___. Normal saline boluses were given without much change. 
5% albumin was then given with gradual increase in urine output 
and SBP to low 100s. He received a 2nd dose of ATG. Prograf was 
held as this was suspected of decreasing urine output. Incision 
was intact with scant serosanguinous drainage. Abdomen was 
non-distended. He experienced a little bit of nausea and was 
given Zofran. Urine output gradually increased to 150ml/hr. He 
continued to receive ___ NS cc/cc urine output replacements.

___ CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:      
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 
two 
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had minimal disease 
with modest 
calcification. The LAD had moderate-severe diffuse disease in 
the 
mid-segment. There were serial 80% lesions in the LAD at the 
bifurcation 
with the D1. The D1 was a large bifurcating vessel with a 
proximal 80% 
lesion. There were left-right collaterals noted. The LCx was a 
non-dominant vessel without critical lesions. The RCA was a 
dominant 
vessel with origin 20% calcified lesion and mid-segment 90% 
lesion. There was mild distal RCA disease. 
2. There was normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP 120 mmHg 
and DBP 
64 bpm. 
3. Successful stenting of the mid-RCA with 3.0 X 28 mm Cypher 
___ 
___ to 3.25 mm with no residual stenosis (see PTCA 
comments for 
detail). 
4. No demonstrable critical ostial RCA disease as documented by 
MLD on 
IVUS. 
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with Cypher DES. 
.
___ Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There 
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the aortic regurgitation is reduced; other 
findings are similar.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with a PMH of HTN, 
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia who presents with an 
inferior STEMI. 
.  
#. CAD: The patient presented with chest pain and was found to 
have an inferior STEMI on EKG. The patient was taken emergently 
for cardiac catheterization on ___, during which time a ___ 
___ was placed in the RCA to a mid-segment 90% lesion. 
Moderately severe diffuse disease was noted in the mid-segment 
of the LAD and at the bifurcation of D1;this was poorly suitable 
for PCI because of the very diffuse and bifurcation disease. The 
patient tolerated cardiac cath very well, with no recurrence of 
chest pain during her hospital course. Peak CK was in the 170s, 
EKG changes were resolving post-cath. ___ Echo showed no 
evidence of systolic dysfunction or WMA. The patient was 
monitored on telemetry with no significant events. She was 
continued on pravastatin 80mg daily, ASA 325mg, and a BB. Plavix 
was started for duration of at least 12months. ACEI was not 
added given that there was no evidence of any systolic 
dysfunction on echo. The patient was advised that she would need 
additional stress testing in ___ weeks to further evaluate 
cardiac status. Given diffuse disease, she may be a candidate 
for CABG in the future.
.
#. Pump: The patient had mild diastolic dysfunction on ___ echo 
in setting of post-MI. There was no systolic dysfunction or wall 
motion abnormality seen on echo. She was discharged on decreased 
dose of lasix (20mg daily), which was initially started for 
history ___ swelling by her PCP. 
.  
#. Rhythm: The patient was in NSR with no acute issues. She was 
continued on metoprolol while inhouse, and was discharged on 
home dose of atenolol upon discharge.
.

IMAGING AND STUDIES

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is 
normal left ventricular wall thickness with anormal cavity size. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. However, 
the inferior wall ishypokinetic. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no resting 
leftventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade II 
diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricularcavity size with 
normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal.The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
Theaortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta 
diameter. There is no evidence for anaortic arch coarctation. 
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. There is 
SEVERE aortic valvestenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or less). There 
is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildlythickened. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspidvalve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimatedpulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

CAROTID US ___
Right ICA <40% stenosis. 
Left ICA <40% stenosis. 
Delayed upstroke in the bilateral ICAs, and more subtle delay in 
the CCA is most likely due to known known severe aortic 
stenosis. 
There is significant calcification artifact in the proximal 
right ICA thus the severity of stenosis may be underestimated, 
consider cross-sectional imaging if concerning symptoms are 
present. 

ANKLE 3 VIEWS ___
No acute fractures or dislocations are seen. There are mild 
degenerative 
changes of the anterior tibiotalar joint with spurring.  
Vascular 
calcifications are seen.There are calcaneal spurs.  There are 
mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of the talonavicular 
joint.  There is mild overall demineralization.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT
=================
___ year old male with CAD with recent PCI, Afib, ESRD on ___
HD, HTN who presents after syncopal episode likely due to vagal 
episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention 
for severe aortic stenosis (EF 60%, peak vel 4.4m/sec, peak 
gradient 77mgHg, mean gradient 45mm, valve area 0.8cm2 ___ 
dimensionless index 0.20; per ___ TTE dimensionless index was 
0.25)
[] continue hemodialysis MFW via fistula
[] consider stopping metoprolol tartrate in setting of EF 60%, 
dose was decreased from 25 mg twice daily to 12.5 mg twice daily 
during this admission (due to bradycardia)
[] stopped Imdur due to lower BPs and severe AS

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# syncopal episode
# severe aortic stenosis
Likely vagal in etiology, but concerning in the context of 
severe aortic stenosis (EF 60%, peak vel 4.4m/sec, peak gradient 
77mgHg, mean gradient 45mm, valve area 08cm2). It is unknown how 
long this patient has had this for and at which severity was 
this last classified. Patient does remember having an 
echocardiogram done ___, but recalls no plans to intervene. 
Telemetry during admission only pertinent for slightly prolonged 
PR interval and mild bradycardia. Carotid ultrasound revealed 
not clinically significant stenosis of both carotid arteries, 
less than 40% stenosis. Patient is to immediately report to 
___'s emergency room with the help of his 
daughters once landing in ___ as he is adamant about not 
wanting to undergo work up and intervention here in ___ due 
to insurance costs and understandably being away from 
home/support. He understands the risks involved in this plan 
including delaying of care and potential mortality, and is 
willing to accept them.

TTE ___
Conclusion: The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. 
There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal 
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal. However, the inferior wall is hypokinetic. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade 
II diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricular cavity size 
with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
The aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending 
aorta diameter. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. 
There is SEVERE aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or 
less). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

# CAD: EKG showing prior inferior MI. Recent stent placed in
___. Currently without angina. Continue metoprolol, 
clopidogrel and statin. Imdur discontinued in light of softer 
pressures and EF of 60%

# Elevated troponin: patient without chest pain and has ESRD.
Defered trending further in absence of concern for ACS. Can 
consider a demand etiology in light of stenotic valve

# Anemia: likely from chronic renal disease. B12
studies and TSH within normal limits.

# ESRD on HD: on ___ dialysis. Dialysis received on ___ 
___. Calcium acetate binder with meals was continued.

# pAF: currently in sinus. Metoprolol tartrate 25mg was 
decreased to 12.5mg BID in light of persistent bradycardia and 
soft pressures. Consider discontinuing metoprolol altogether in 
light of EF 60%. Eliquis dose reduced 2.5mg in setting of age 
and ESRD.

#T2DM: continue Lantus and ISS.

#HTN: continued norvasc, discontinued isosorbide dinitrate in 
light of soft pressures and EF of 60%

Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is an 81-year-old male who presented with a syncopal episode after a baseball game. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), and atrial fibrillation (Afib). He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were notable for a temperature of 97.2°F, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 151/48 mmHg. His physical examination revealed a bradycardic rhythm, normal rhythm, and a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium.

Laboratory results showed elevated levels of troponin (0.53 ng/mL) and creatinine (11.0 mg/dL), as well as mild anemia (Hgb 11.3 g/dL). Imaging studies revealed severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0 cm² or less, as well as mild degenerative changes in the ankle joints.

The patient was prescribed medications at discharge, including Eliquis for Afib and metoprolol tartrate for hypertension. He was also advised to undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention for severe aortic stenosis, continue hemodialysis three times a week, and consider stopping metoprolol tartrate due to bradycardia.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was marked by a syncopal episode likely due to a vagal episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis, and he was discharged with recommendations for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||"
