IMAGING:
==========
Chest PA/lat ___
1. No pneumonia.
2. Opacity in the left lower lung base is likely due to nipple 
shadow,
however, a focal mass cannot be excluded.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Although likely due to nipple shadows, 
re-imaging with conventional chest radiographs are recommended 
for further evaluation of left lower lung opacity.

Paracentesis ___
Technically successful ultrasound-guided therapeutic 
paracentesis, with
removal of 5 L of straw-colored fluid.

Chest Portable ___
nterval extubation.  Decreased lung volumes with patchy 
bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Crowding of 
the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large 
effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal 
contours are likely stable given differences in patient 
positioning and inspiratory effort.

RUQ US ___:
1.  The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.  
2. The liver has a cirrhotic morphology.  No focal lesions seen. 
 
3.  Large volume ascites. 

CXR ___:
___ to ___.  Increasing retrocardiac opacity, 
suggestive of 
pneumonia or aspiration.  Stable right basal atelectasis.  
Moderate 
cardiomegaly persists.  In the interval, the patient has been 
intubated the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 
approximately 6 cm above the carinal. 

CXR ___:
No acute intrathoracic abnormality. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ EtOH cirrhosis MELD 17 complicated by resistant ascites 
requiring q2wk para, 3 cords of grade I varices ___ who is 
actively drinking presented to the ED with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, s/p endoscopy and banding and management of 
abdominal pain.

#Abdominal Pain: likely from ascites on admission, with 
diagnostic paracentesis completed showing no signs of SBP, 
followed by ___ guided therapeutic paracentesis. Abdominal pain 
controlled initially with oxycodone as needed, and then 
transitioned to tramadol. Her hospital course was then notable 
for a rising bilirubin.
Infectious workup was repeated with blood culture, CXR, and 
peritoneal culture which were all unrevealing. She was 
discharged to complete an antibiotic course for SBP prophylaxis 
in the setting of her variceal bleed as well as for her 
enterococcal UTI. She is discharged with instructions for blood 
work within 1 week  and a follow up with her primary 
hepatologist.

# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive at baseline 90/50's. On 
presentation to ED 80/40's; likely from acute blood loss in 
setting of hematemesis and possible GI bleed versus 
decompensated cirrhosis; patient also has ascites on exam 
concerning for an SBP.  Peritoneal fluid w/ 32 WBCs. Patient was 
transfused 4u on ___ and 1u ___ and maintained on levophed 
initially.  Prior to transfer to medicine floor, she was started 
on 10mg TID midodrine. 

# Upper GI Bleed: patient presented with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, tarry stools, with a history of 
varices/gastropathy/GAVE. Differential diagnosis includes PUD 
vs. variceal bleeding vs. bleeding from GAVE.  Patient was 
started on SBP prophylaxis with ceftriaxone and started on 
octreotide and PPI gtts. On ___, on admission to ICU, EGD was 
performed; banded 2 grade II/III varices during ICU admission. 
She was treated with Octeride gtt, PPI gtt, SBP with 
ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone was continued for 7 day course. Repeat 
blood counts remained stable and she was asymptomatic with 
orthostatic testing. As her hospital course stabilized, she was 
resumed on furosemide and spironolactone. 

# Urinary Enterococcus: Asymptomatic though in setting of 
hypotension concerning for infection. Patient received empiric 
IV vancomycin (___-), which was continued for a 7 day course 
for complicated UTI (last day ___. 
 
# Cirrhosis: MELD 17 ___ C. ___ be decompensated now 
given worsening BPs. Complicated by ascites, varices, 
encepholpathy, abdominal pain. No history of SBP. On 
lactulose/rifaxmin at home although unclear compliance. Diarrhea 
at baseline. Recent cold, no reversal of sleep/wake. Not 
encepholopathic. Actively drinking; therefore not a transplant 
candidate. Patient was continued on lactulose, rifaximin.  
Patient underwent thepareutic paracentesis in the ICU with 
removal of 3L. The Lasix/sprinolactone in the setting of her 
recent active GI bleeding and hypotension, resumed later on the 
hospital course, along with lactuose and rifaximin.

# Coagulopathy: INR 1.4. Plt 77. Around baseling. Likely 
secondary to liver disease and poor nutrition. 

# Alcohol abuse: About a bottle of wine daily. Last drink day 
prior to admission. Tachycardic and tremulous on exam.  Patient 
was placed on CIWA scale, treatment dose IV thiamine was 
initiated along with IV folate and multivitamin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
-Patient to complete SBP ppx course on ___
-Patient to complete enterococcal UTI course on ___
-Patient discharged on tramadol for her chronic abdominal pain, 
repeated paracentesis did not reveal evidence of SBP
- Patient discharged on sucralfate until she is seen in clinic 
follow up
- Patient ordered for CBC, Chem, LFTs to be collected on 
___ and faxed to the liver transplant clinic
- On CXR, noted left lower lung opacity. Although likely due to 
nipple shadows, re-imaging with conventional chest radiographs 
are recommended for further evaluation.

recommended.

CT abdomen ___: 
1. Nodular liver with large volume simple ascites, which can be 
seen in the setting of cirrhosis.  Although no discrete 
peritoneal enhancement is seen, underlying peritonitis cannot be 
excluded, and clinical correlation with possible fluid sampling 
is recommended
2. No signs of loculated fluid collection or bowel perforation.  
Normal appendix.
3. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F w/ PMH of presumed alcohol cirrhosis 
here with abdominal pain and increased girth secondary to 
worsening ascites who was discharged with improved pain.

Acute Issues:
#Abdominal pain- likely secondary to increased ascites as there 
was no intraperitoneal disease found on CT scan.  Furthermore 
her pain improved with therapeutic paracentis of 6.5L.  Her 
diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP.

Ascites fluid leak - due to persist fluid leak a suture was 
placed by surgery.  #This was successful in stopping the leak.  
Suture may be removed in approx 10 days from placement on the 
day of discharge.

#Cirrhosis- patient reported receiving her previous care at 
___. When she presented she had evidence of 
large amount of ascites. Normal coags and plateltes and low 
albumin. She had a therapeutic paracentesis -6.5L, and had 
leaking para site on the LLQ that required a figure 8 stitch to 
be placed to stop the leaking. She reported still drinking 
alcohol.  Labs performed here were negative for other sources of 
cirrhosis detectable by lab serology. She had no evidence of 
encephalopathy, no spider angiomas.  Her blood pressure ran low 
and she had mild hyponatremia.  Due to her low blood pressure 
(80s/50s) it was decided to hold her diuretics on discharge and 
that she would followup with her PCP in ___ couple of days to 
repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics at a low dose. 
She was counseled on adhering to a low sodium diet and fluid 
restriction of 2L. Suture to be removed the week of 
___ will have followup in the ___ clinic with 
Dr. ___ on ___. 

#Alcohol use- patient with alcohol use. She had presumed alcohol 
cirrhosis secondary to it.  She was placed on the CIWA scale and 
never scored or showed signs of withdrawal.

#Low blood pressure- patient had blood pressure in the ___. 
She had no orthostaic symptoms and her blood pressure increased 
with sitting and standing.  Her urine was dilute and therefore 
it was felt that this  was not secondary to volume depletion and 
could be due to her underlying liver disease.  

Chronic/transitional Issue:
#Hypertension- patient reported being on HCTZ on admission. This 
was held during her stay and at the time of discharge.  We do 
not anticipate restarting as an outpatient as the pt appears to 
have low BPs chronically from cirrhosis.
 
Medications on Admission:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.
You were admitted to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain. 
You had excessive fluid in your abdomen due to too much salt and 
fluid intake and not taking your diuretics (water pills).  You 
had this fluid removed by paracentesis. You had some continued 
output from the paracentesis site and had a stitch placed. This 
stitch should remain in place for 1 week and removed by a 
clinician at that time.
 It is very important that you avoid salt in your diet and do 
not take in too much fluid. We also recommend that you cut down 
on your alcohol use and seek assistance in ways to do this 
safely if you choose to do it.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a PMHx of EtOH cirrhosis, 
diverticulosis, and hypertension p/w progressively worsening 
abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
# ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA: CT scan showed mild colonic edema, 
possibly from infectious colitis vs. portal colopathy. Patient 
did not have any bowel movements for the first 24 hours of 
admission, indicating that CT findings were likely due to portal 
colopathy. Although her stools were loose, she was also taking 
lactulose. Abdominal pain may have been precipitated by 
continued alcohol abuse. Diagnostic para revealed 1 PMN. She was 
initially treated with cipro/flagyl, but patient refused these 
medications, and they were discontinued due to low suspicion of 
infection. She will follow-up with gynecology for possible 
pelvic congestion syndrome, which was noted on CT.  

# CIRRHOSIS: Secondary to alcohol abuse. Complicated by portal 
hypertension and ascites with recent hospitalizations for 
decompensation. No history of SBP, varices, or hepatic 
encephalopathy. Patient continues to drink alcohol despite 
emphasis from outpatient providers to abstain and declined to 
see a social worker during this admission. LFTs are consistent 
with continued alcohol use.   

# ASCITES: CT Abd/Pelvis with moderate ascites. Diagnostic 
paracentesis was negative for SBP. She underwent an 
ultrasound-guided therapeutic para draining 1.25L fluid by ___ on 
___. Her home furosemide and spironolactone were continued.  

# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: No history of hepatic encephalopathy. 
Her home lactulose and rifaximin were continued.   

# ETOH ABUSE: History of withdrawal seizures. She was monitored 
on a CIWA during this admission and required doses of diazepam 
initially. She had no complicated withdrawal sx during this 
admission. Folate and thiamine were continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient was concerned about her reducible umbilical hernia. 
Although she remains very high risk for surgical repair, she 
plans to seek a second opinion as an outpatient. This can be 
addressed at liver clinic followup
- Stool cultures pending on discharge
- Continue to encourage alcohol cessation. Patient declined to 
see a social worker during this admission.
- If she continues to be symptomatic, consider colonoscopy as 
outpatient to evaluate area of colopathy vs. colitis
- F/u with Ob-Gyn to evaluate possibility of pelvic congestion 
syndrome as contributor to her abdominal pain
- Patient should have electrolytes and liver labs checked within 
1 week of discharge, sent to Dr. ___ in the ___,

Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for abdominal pain and diarrhea. We initially 
treated you with antibiotics, but these were stopped as we had a 
low suspicion for infection. We drew cultures, which did not 
grow anything while you were here, and checked your stool for 
infection. You tested negative for C. diff, a common infection 
that could cause diarrhea. You should follow-up with your 
gynecologist to address other potential causes of abdominal 
pain. You also underwent a paracentesis while you were here to 
remove some fluid from your belly. 

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ team

TSH ___: 0.93
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the neuroscience step-down unit on 
the day of admission, ___. She continued on Dexamethasone 
4mg IV QH and Keppra 1,000mg PO BID. A head CTA and CT torso was 
ordered. Radiation oncology and neuro-oncology were consulted. 

The CT of the Torso was negative for any malignancy; an 8mm 
thyroid nodule was noted that will require an US on an 
outpatient basis.

On ___, the patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of the 
right temporal brain mass, which went well without complication. 
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient 
underwent a postoperative CT scan, which revealed no active 
bleeding. Afterwards, the patient was transferred to the floor 
where she remained stable overnight into ___. On ___ she 
udnerwent a WAND study in anticipation of going to the OR on 
___ for resection. 

On ___ she went to the operating room for a right temporal 
craniectomy for resection of intracranial lesion. She toelrated 
the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room, and 
transferred to the ICU post-operatively for observation and 
care. Post op CT scan showed no signs of bleed.  In the evening 
the patient had afib with RVR with HRs up to the 140s.  The 
patient was converted back to NSR overnight after going on a 
dilt drip. 

On ___ the patient continued to progress well in the ICU.  A 
cardiology consult was placed for the afib which recommended an 
echocardiogram, TSH, and starting her on metoprolol 12.5mg BID.  
These recommendations were followed. Her afib subsequently 
resolved. The MRI showed postsurgical changes along the right 
temporal lobe without evidence of residual nodular enhancement.  
Residual FLAIR signal hyperintensity along the medial temporal 
lobe with a new area of abnormal FLAIR posterior and lateral to 
surgical cavity with associated slow diffusion which could be 
related to postsurgical changes or ischemia. The echocardiogram 
was within normal limits. TSH level was normal (0.93).

On ___, the patient was transferred to the floor, and her diet 
was advanced as tolerated. She started to work with physical 
therapy.

___, the patient contintued to progress well on the floor.  
Physical therapy worked with her and fel that she was limited by 
lethargy, and once resolved,
would improve rapidly. Physical therapy felt the patient would 
benefit from another day of physical therapy on an inpatient 
basis. She will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient, but 
should remain on metoprolol. 

On ___, patient was re-evaluated by ___ and determined that she 
needed an additional day to work on stairs. On ___, patient 
received magnesium citrate to help encourage a BM. ___ evaluated 
her and determined she is safe to discharge home with ___. She 
was stable upon discharge.

Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain 
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking 
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) & 
Senna while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and 
Ibuprofen etc.  
**You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will 
not require blood work monitoring.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure 
you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, 
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach 
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with 
meals, or a glass of milk. 
Clearance to drive and return to work will be addressed at 
your post-operative office visit.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while

IMAGING AND STUDIES

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is 
normal left ventricular wall thickness with anormal cavity size. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. However, 
the inferior wall ishypokinetic. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no resting 
leftventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade II 
diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricularcavity size with 
normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal.The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
Theaortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta 
diameter. There is no evidence for anaortic arch coarctation. 
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. There is 
SEVERE aortic valvestenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or less). There 
is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildlythickened. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspidvalve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimatedpulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

CAROTID US ___
Right ICA <40% stenosis. 
Left ICA <40% stenosis. 
Delayed upstroke in the bilateral ICAs, and more subtle delay in 
the CCA is most likely due to known known severe aortic 
stenosis. 
There is significant calcification artifact in the proximal 
right ICA thus the severity of stenosis may be underestimated, 
consider cross-sectional imaging if concerning symptoms are 
present. 

ANKLE 3 VIEWS ___
No acute fractures or dislocations are seen. There are mild 
degenerative 
changes of the anterior tibiotalar joint with spurring.  
Vascular 
calcifications are seen.There are calcaneal spurs.  There are 
mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of the talonavicular 
joint.  There is mild overall demineralization.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT
=================
___ year old male with CAD with recent PCI, Afib, ESRD on ___
HD, HTN who presents after syncopal episode likely due to vagal 
episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention 
for severe aortic stenosis (EF 60%, peak vel 4.4m/sec, peak 
gradient 77mgHg, mean gradient 45mm, valve area 0.8cm2 ___ 
dimensionless index 0.20; per ___ TTE dimensionless index was 
0.25)
[] continue hemodialysis MFW via fistula
[] consider stopping metoprolol tartrate in setting of EF 60%, 
dose was decreased from 25 mg twice daily to 12.5 mg twice daily 
during this admission (due to bradycardia)
[] stopped Imdur due to lower BPs and severe AS

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# syncopal episode
# severe aortic stenosis
Likely vagal in etiology, but concerning in the context of 
severe aortic stenosis (EF 60%, peak vel 4.4m/sec, peak gradient 
77mgHg, mean gradient 45mm, valve area 08cm2). It is unknown how 
long this patient has had this for and at which severity was 
this last classified. Patient does remember having an 
echocardiogram done ___, but recalls no plans to intervene. 
Telemetry during admission only pertinent for slightly prolonged 
PR interval and mild bradycardia. Carotid ultrasound revealed 
not clinically significant stenosis of both carotid arteries, 
less than 40% stenosis. Patient is to immediately report to 
___'s emergency room with the help of his 
daughters once landing in ___ as he is adamant about not 
wanting to undergo work up and intervention here in ___ due 
to insurance costs and understandably being away from 
home/support. He understands the risks involved in this plan 
including delaying of care and potential mortality, and is 
willing to accept them.

TTE ___
Conclusion: The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. 
There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal 
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal. However, the inferior wall is hypokinetic. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade 
II diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricular cavity size 
with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
The aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending 
aorta diameter. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. 
There is SEVERE aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or 
less). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

# CAD: EKG showing prior inferior MI. Recent stent placed in
___. Currently without angina. Continue metoprolol, 
clopidogrel and statin. Imdur discontinued in light of softer

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is an 81-year-old male who presented with a syncopal episode after a baseball game. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), and atrial fibrillation (Afib). He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were notable for a temperature of 97.2°F, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 151/48 mmHg. His physical examination revealed a bradycardic rhythm, normal rhythm, and a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium.

Laboratory results showed elevated levels of troponin (0.53 ng/mL) and creatinine (11.0 mg/dL), as well as mild anemia (Hgb 11.3 g/dL). Imaging studies revealed severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0 cm² or less, as well as mild degenerative changes in the ankle joints.

The patient was prescribed medications at discharge, including Eliquis for Afib and metoprolol tartrate for hypertension. He was also advised to undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention for severe aortic stenosis, continue hemodialysis three times a week, and consider stopping metoprolol tartrate due to bradycardia.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was marked by a syncopal episode likely due to a vagal episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis, and he was discharged with recommendations for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||"

___ CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:      
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 
two 
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had minimal disease 
with modest 
calcification. The LAD had moderate-severe diffuse disease in 
the 
mid-segment. There were serial 80% lesions in the LAD at the 
bifurcation 
with the D1. The D1 was a large bifurcating vessel with a 
proximal 80% 
lesion. There were left-right collaterals noted. The LCx was a 
non-dominant vessel without critical lesions. The RCA was a 
dominant 
vessel with origin 20% calcified lesion and mid-segment 90% 
lesion. There was mild distal RCA disease. 
2. There was normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP 120 mmHg 
and DBP 
64 bpm. 
3. Successful stenting of the mid-RCA with 3.0 X 28 mm Cypher 
___ 
___ to 3.25 mm with no residual stenosis (see PTCA 
comments for 
detail). 
4. No demonstrable critical ostial RCA disease as documented by 
MLD on 
IVUS. 
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with Cypher DES. 
.
___ Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There 
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the aortic regurgitation is reduced; other 
findings are similar.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with a PMH of HTN, 
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia who presents with an 
inferior STEMI. 
.  
#. CAD: The patient presented with chest pain and was found to 
have an inferior STEMI on EKG. The patient was taken emergently 
for cardiac catheterization on ___, during which time a ___ 
___ was placed in the RCA to a mid-segment 90% lesion. 
Moderately severe diffuse disease was noted in the mid-segment 
of the LAD and at the bifurcation of D1;this was poorly suitable 
for PCI because of the very diffuse and bifurcation disease. The 
patient tolerated cardiac cath very well, with no recurrence of 
chest pain during her hospital course. Peak CK was in the 170s, 
EKG changes were resolving post-cath. ___ Echo showed no 
evidence of systolic dysfunction or WMA. The patient was 
monitored on telemetry with no significant events. She was 
continued on pravastatin 80mg daily, ASA 325mg, and a BB. Plavix 
was started for duration of at least 12months. ACEI was not 
added given that there was no evidence of any systolic 
dysfunction on echo. The patient was advised that she would need 
additional stress testing in ___ weeks to further evaluate 
cardiac status. Given diffuse disease, she may be a candidate 
for CABG in the future.
.
#. Pump: The patient had mild diastolic dysfunction on ___ echo 
in setting of post-MI. There was no systolic dysfunction or wall 
motion abnormality seen on echo. She was discharged on decreased 
dose of lasix (20mg daily), which was initially started for 
history ___ swelling by her PCP. 
.  
#. Rhythm: The patient was in NSR with no acute issues. She was 
continued on metoprolol while inhouse, and was discharged on 
home dose of atenolol upon discharge.
.  
#. Borderline diabetes: The patient had HbA1c of 5.8% with good 
glycemic control with diet-modification. 
.
#. Chronic pain/fibromyalgia: The patient was continued on 
dilaudid prn.
.  
#. RLE pain: The patient was continued on home dose of 
neurontin.
.
#. The patient was discharged on ___ in good condition, VSS, 
ambulating well, CP-free. She was advised to follow-up with her 
cardiologist and PCP shortly after discharge.

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 64-year-old female who presented with an inferior STEMI. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis, chronic pain syndrome, depression, and bilateral cataracts. She has a family history of premature coronary artery disease in her father, who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. 

The patient's allergies include penicillins and ibuprofen. She was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of chest pain and was found to have an 80% stenosis at the bifurcation of the LAD and OM, which was too difficult to stent due to concern for jailing the artery. She also had a 90% lesion to the mid RCA, which was stented with a DES. 

The patient's medications at discharge include ASA, morphine, lopressor, heparin, plavix, and integrallin. Her physical examination was normal, with no signs of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Her laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated troponin and creatine kinase levels. 

The patient's diagnosis is two-vessel coronary artery disease, with successful stenting of the mid-RCA with a Cypher DES. Her echocardiogram showed normal left atrial size, left ventricular wall thickness, and regional/global systolic function, with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. ||endoftext||"

CT Abdomen and Pelvis (IV Contrast):
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. Atelectasis within the lingula is additionally 
noted. 
An amorphous area low attenuation is identified within segment 
IVb of the 
liver. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, 
spleen, 
pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear within normal 
limits. The 
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally. A 
3-cm low- 
attenuation lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney is 
consistent with a simple cyst. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
of the infrarenal abdominal aorta is evident.   
There is thickening of the cecum and significant pericecal 
stranding of 
mesenteric fat. Surgical clips at the site of appendectomy are 
noted. No 
evidence of abscess or loculated fluid. A small amount of free 
fluid in this area, which also tracks down into the pelvis is 
seen. Although the distal ileum is not well distended with oral 
contrast, there is a suggestion of bowel wall thickening/edema 
and stranding of the surrounding mesenteric fat. No organized 
fluid collection is evident, however. There is no evidence of 
bowel obstruction as contrast has passed through to the rectum. 
There is no free air within the abdomen. Although the colon is 
not distended, there is a suggestion of diffuse colonic wall 
thickening. 
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, 
intrapelvic 
loops of small bowel are unremarkable. A Foley balloon is 
present within a 
decompressed bladder. A small amount of free fluid is evident 
within the 
pelvis. Small, bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are 
evident. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Inflammatory process appears to be centered in the ileocecal 
area at the site of recent appendectomy. No organized or 
drainable intra-abdominal fluid collection. Assessment is 
somewhat limited by lack of distal ileal distention with oral 
contrast. A small amount of free fluid and scattered subjacent 
lymph nodes are additionally evident.  
2. Equivocal diffuse colonic wall thickening. This finding 
raises the 
possibility of colitis and and infectious process such as C. 
difficile should be considered.   
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal 
akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the 
basal half of the inferior wall. There is minimal hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %). The estimated cardiac 
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w ischemia. Left pleural effusion. 
.
ECG ___: normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in 
leads III, AVF
.
PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
final blood cultures from ___ (no growth to date)
stool cultures, O&P from ___. SEPSIS:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an outside hospital with 
hypotension, on Levophed with an elevated WBC count of 22.6 on 
admission.  The source of infection was not clear on admission 
and differential included infection from recurrent abscesses at 
appendectomy site or C. Diff colitis.  Other etiology considered 
was reaction to CT contrast.  Was started on Vanocmycin, Zosyn 
and Flagyl in the MICU.  He remained hemodynamically stable and 
afebrile and Levophed was stopped on the day of transfer for 
MAP>65, SvO2 72, CVP 6 and good urine output.  CT showed 
inflammation prior appendectomy site without fluid collection.  
Surgery was consulted and did not recommend surgery.  
Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended 48 hours of IV 
antibiotics for presumed GI infection, then 3 weeks of PO 
antibiotics.  Cultures were obtained on ___ from ___ 
___ and showed no growth to date of blood or urine 
cultures.  Blood and urine cultures collected at ___ 
showed no growth to date.  C. Diff X 3 were negative.  The 
patient continued to do well and was trasnferred to the general 
medical floor on ___.  He was continued on IV antibiotics 
and then changed to PO antibiotics on ___.  He was put on 
Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID and Metronidazole 500mg PO TID and 
was discharged with 16 more days of antibiotics.  He will 
___ with his PCP ___ 1 week.  Another possible etiology for 
his symptoms that was considered was anaphylaxis from PO 
contrast from the CT scan, although this was less likely given 
that he has had PO contrast in the past without problems.  We 
recommended that he see an allergist as an outpatient to assess 
the possibility of an allergic reaction to PO contrast.
.
2. NSTEMI
The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes with a CK 
of 133, CKMB 19, Troponin T 0.29 and T-wave inversions in leads 
III and AVL.  Cardiology was called and thought this was likely 
rate-related demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia due 
to sepsis physiology.  Cardiac enzymes trended down and 
___ ECGs showed no change.  The patient's tachycardia 
improved with IV fluids and antibiotics.  He was asymptomatic 
during his admission.  He was put on telemetry and had no events 
or arrythmias.  An echocardiogram showed global reduced 
function, EF 45% and focal akinesis of basal inferior wall.  
Aspirin 325mg PO qday and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID were started 
for NSTEMI.  Cardiology did not recommend heparin or 
anti-platelet agents.  Cardiology recommended a ___ echo 
and cardiologist appointment within 4 weeks after his acute 
illness had resolved. The patient will have this scheduled with 
his primary care doctor.  He remained asymptomatic with no chest 
pain or signs of clinical heart failure.
.
3. EOSINOPHILIA
The patient's WBCs trended down from admission from 22.6 to 
11.8.  He had 23% bands on admission which resolved by 
discharge.  His eosinophil count was 0 on admission, however on 
___ he had 32% eosinophils, on ___ had 38% eosinophils, and 
on ___ had 36% eosinophils.  This corresponds to an absolute 
eosinophil count of 3680 on ___, 4294 on ___, and 4248 on 
___.  He had no signs of drug reaction, no fevers, skin rashes 
or other symptoms.  His diarrhea had improved over the course of 
admission but was still having ___ bowel movements per day.  His 
stool was checked for C. Diff and was negative X 3.  Ova and 
parasites and fecal stool cultures were pending at the time of 
discharge.  It was recommended that he see an allergist for 
discussion and testing for reaction to PO contrast from the CT 
scan.
.
4. DIARRHEA
Most likely etiology is antibiotic-associated as the patient has 
been on antibiotics off and on for the past several weeks.  His 
diarrhea was at times watery, but improved through admission and 
was described as loose stool at the time of discharge.  
Clostridium Difficile was checked X 3 and was negative.  He was 
discharged with Cipro and Flagyl for his antibiotic regimen.  He 
will ___ with his PCP with any further problems.  His 
final stool cultures are still pending at the time of discharge.
.
5. ANXIETY
The patient was anxious during his hospitalization regarding his 
medical condition and etiology of his sepsis.  He was given 
Ativan 0.5mg PRN for anxiety symptoms.  He was given Trazodone 
25mg PO qHS to help with sleep.  
.
6. PROPHYLAXIS
Mr. ___ was given SC Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  He was 
able to tolerate a regular diet on ___.  
.
His symptoms improved and he was discharged with close PCP 
___ and instructions to ___ with cardiology as 
arranged by his PCP.  He was also recommended to see an 
allergist on discharge for ___ of this episode as a 
potential reaction to PO contrast from the CT scan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and 
septic shock after having a perforated appendicitis several 
weeks ago.  All your blood cultures were negative.  You were 
admitted to the intensive care unit and improved dramatically on 
antibiotics.  You were initially put on intravenous antibiotics 
and these were changed to oral antibiotics after 72 hours.  You 
experienced some chest pain and blood tests showed that was some 
damange to your heart which was likely from the low blood 
pressure.  You had an echocardiogram which showed some reduced 
function of the heart.  You should see a cardiologist as an 
outpatient as arranged by your primary care doctor and have 
another echocardiogram in 1 month to reassess your heart.

You had a rise in your white blood cell count associated with 
the sepsis.  Your eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, was 
still elevated on discharge.  You should have your blood checked 
in 1 week to assess your white blood count and differential.  
This will be arranged by your primary care doctor.

who presents with cough and shortness of breath
.  
#  Cough- Patient was recently admitted with similar symptoms at 
___ and was discharged with a course of augmentin and 
doxycycline for CAP, which she completed.  However, prior to 
admission, she developed cough associated with shortness of 
breath so she presented to ___.   In the ED, she was febrile 
with possible early pneumonia on CXR, so she received a dose of 
ceftriaxone.  Given that her WBC was normal, and cough was 
non-productive, the patient was not initially treated for HCAP.  
In addition, she has presented like this in the past and was 
treated for a COPD exacerbation.  On admission, she was started 
on azithromycin, prednisone 60mg daily and nebulizers.  Her 
symptoms improved and oxygen requirement was decreasing.  
However, she developed a fever on ___ so she was started on 
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, given recent hospital 
discharge.  She was weaned off oxygen and worked well with 
physical therapy.  Urine legionella was negative.  Blood and 
urine cultures were negative.  Sputum culture was contaminated 
with normal respiratory flora.  The patient completed an 8 day 
course of antibiotics- vancomycin 1gm q48hours, Cefepime 1g q24 
hours via ___ line.  She is being discharged on a prednisone 
taper starting at 30mg daily.  On discharge, cough, shortness of 
breath and oxygen requirement had resolved.  She was able to 
ambulate with no shortness of breath.  The patient was afebrile 
from ___ until discharge, had a normal WBC count and looked 
well.  
.  
#  Fever- Likely secondary to pneumonia.  She lacked other 
symptoms of influenza (myalgias, etc).  Patient's cultures were 
negative.  UA was negative for UTI.  
.
#  COPD- Patient improved with azithromycin, nebulizers and 
steroids.  She was weaned off oxygen and is being discharged on 
a prednisone taper, starting at 30mg daily for 14 additional 
days of therapy
.  
#  Atrial fibrillation- Continued home amiodarone and 
metoprolol.  Heart rate was regular and was well-controlled.  
Her INR trended up to 4.3 so she was cut down from 2mg 3x/week 
to 0.5 or 1.0mg daily (pending INR) given that she is on 
antibiotics and amiodarone.  As mentioned, her INR peaked at 4.3 
but then trended down.  We resumed her at 2mg daily on ___ 
when INR was 1.7.  Subsequent trend was 1.7 -> 1.5 -> 1.6.  She 
received 2mg of coumadin on ___.  We have 
instructed her to resume her prior regimen on discharge meaning 
she will take 2mg on ___ and 1mg on ___.  We also asked the 
patient to have an INR check on ___ and to please fax the 
results to her PCP for instruction on management of coumadin 
dosing.  
.  
#  Diastolic CHF- The patient has a known history of chronic 
diastolic heart failure.  On admission, there were no signs of 
fluid overload on exam.  Her oxygen requirement was attributed 
to pneumonia and COPD exerbation.  Given her elevated creatinine 
on admission, her lasix and lisinopril were initially held.  Her 
creatinine improved so we resumed her lisinopril at 20mg daily.  
By discharge, we resumed home dose of lisinopril.  Once 
creatinine stabilized, home dose of lasix was resumed and 
patient's creatinine remained stable.  She was discharged on 
home dose of lasix 20mg daily and has ___ with Dr. ___ 
on ___.
.
#  CAD- The patient did not present with chest pain.  Her EKGs 
were consistent with prior.  She was continued on her home 
statin and beta-blocker.  
.
#  Hypertension- As mentioned above, her lisinopril was 
initially held given ___ but was resumed at home dose by 
discharge.  She was continued on the remainder of her home 
medications- imdur 30mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg daily.  BP's were remained stable. 
.
#  Numbness- On the last day of admission, patient revealed to 
us that she had been experiencing numbness in her fingertips 
(all of them).  Exam did not demonstrate any sensory or motor 
deficit as patient has ___ strength in all 4 extremities with 
intact sensation bilaterally.  She is not a diabetic.  Other 
possible etiologies include b12 deficiency, radiculopathy, or 
vasculitis.  Given that her symptoms are in both hands with only 
the DIP joint affected, a cervical radiculopathy is unlikely.  
She has no other systemic symptoms suggestive of vasculitis 
(skin changes, fever, chills) and her labwork is benign.  No 
indication for imaging as remainder of neurological exam is 
intact, including gait.  This also could be due to a medication 
as she received IV antibiotics.  B12 level checked and pending 
at the time of discharge, but, given description of symptoms, 
will likely not be the etiology behind this numbness.  We ask 
that the patient's PCP ___ on this issue when she sees the 
patient on ___.
.

colace, pain management with tylenol

There is good opacification of the central pulmonary arteries.  
1.8-2cm nodular opacity present in apicoposterior segmental of 
left upper lobe.  There is additional smaller groundglass 
opacity in the left upper lobe measuring about ___.  This could 
be infectious but a neoplasm cannot be excluded.  

___ CXR 
1.   Opacity measuring up to 2.0 cm in the left upper lobe 
corresponds to nodule in the left upper lobe seen on outside 
hospital chest CT ___.
2.  Bibasilar atelectasis
3.  No focal consolidation.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with IDDM, possible pyoderma gangrenosum of the perianal 
area (on Humira since ___, hidradenitis suppuritiva L groin 
& R axilla, cognitive defect, transferred to ___ from ___ 
___ found to have NSTEMI on hep gtt with troponin 0.3 
downtrending to .22 with outside EKG <1mm lateral ST 
depressions, on CTA found to have 2.7cm upper left lobe nodule 
with significant hilar lymphadenopathy. Upon admission, patient 
was placed on a heparin drip and received PRN nitroglycerin for 
control of chest pain. Patient was taken to the cath lab on 
___ that showed 60% stenosis of his RCA and 30% stenosis of 
LCx. No intervention was performed. He was started on ASA, 
statin a beta-blocker for his CAD. Patient continued to complain 
of chest pain, but given the cath results this was thought to be 
unlikely caused by cardiac disease. He had an incidental finding 
of a RUL lung nodule and significant hilar lymphadenopathy. 
Patient reported recent night sweats with unintentional 30-lb 
weight loss. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with hilar lymph node biopsy as an 
outpatient. Additionally, the patient had on-going rectal pain 
due to his ___ wound. Dermatology and colorectal surgery 
were consulted and recommended wound care. Biopsies and further 
work up were deferred for the outpatient setting. Patient also 
developed loose stools with incontinence concerning for C diff 
given history. He was started and discharged with a prescription 
for PO vancomycin. 

  
 # CORONARIES: unknown
 # PUMP: unknown 
 # RHYTHM: sinus    

# NSTEMI: Patient presented with three days of chest pain, peak 
trop 0.3, EKG with <1mm STD in lateral leads. Patient EKG did 
show evidence of old inferolateral infarct. Patient was started 
on a heparin drip for NSTEMI. Chest pain required nitroglycerin 
and intermittently oxycodone/IV morphine for relief. Patient 
underwent coronary catheterization on ___ which revealed 
RCA 60% stenosis and LCx 30% stenosis. No intervention was 
performed. Patient began ASA, Atorvastatin, metoprolol for CAD 
medical management. Following cath, patient continued to have 
chest pain that was largely unchanged. Multiple EKGs pre and 
post cath did not show new changes or signs of ischemia. While 
the patient had documented CAD on cath, it is possible that some 
of his chest pain was also due to demand ischemia given give 
___ wounds. Pain ___ also be due to hilar 
lymphadenopathy found on CTA. Interventional pulmonology was 
consulted, please see explanation below for lung nodule/hilar 
lymphadenopathy.

# Pulmonary nodule: CT chest reveals discrete nodule  in LUL 
that is >2.0cm in diameter.  OSH started CTX and Doxy for CAP on 
___ but this was discontinued on ___ given no suspicion for 
PNA. Patient with reported history 30 pound weight loss, night 
sweats for ___ months. CTA was uploaded to ___ system for 
image review. Per wet read of radiology, most concerning on the 
CTA was significant hilar lymphadenopathy. History is concerning 
for possible lymphoma vs other malignancy vs infectious 
etiology. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with biopsy as an outpatient. Patient 
is scheduled for bronchoscopy on ___. 

# Hydradinitis Suppurative Lesions: Patient with lesions in  
axilla, groin, and perianal area are consistent with the 
distribution seen in hidradinitis suppurativa. He has started to 
see improvement in his right axillary lesion but his perianal 
lesions are unchanged.  Dermatology was consulted for re-biopsy 
of anal wound given concern given differing pathology reports 
and unclear diagnosis given refractory nature of his perianal 
lesion. There was no evidence of infection on exam. Colorectal 
surgery was also consulted who discussed patient case with derm. 
___ wounds are painful and of unclear etiology. DDx 
includes verrucous carcinoma vs pyoderma gangrenosum. Since 
patient had multiple previous biopsies by his outpatient 
dermatologist, the decision was made to defer further biopsies 
and discuss with his primary dermatologist as an outpatient. 
Patient was discharged home with wound care ___ services. Humira 
was restarted on discharge, held in-house. 
 
# Coagulopathy: INR elevated on admission to 1.6.  Liver 
synthetic function wnl.  INR remined stable but elevated 
throughout admission. 

# DMII: On metformin at home. Held metformin in the setting of 
potential cath. Last HbA1C 7.2% ___. Patient was given 
Humalog sliding scale while inpatient and discharged to continue 
home dose of metformin on discharge. 

****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES****
[ ] Follow up C diff studies. Discontinue PO vanc if negative. 
If patient, patient should complete 2 week course
[ ] Incidental nodule and hilar LAD on CT requiring 
bronchoscopy/biopsy. Ensure patient follows up with 
interventional pulmonology. Procedure is scheduled for ___ 
[ ] Did not require cath and chest pain is unlikely cardiac, but 
cath did show CAD; therefore, the patient was started on 
atorvastatin 80mg daily, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 BID and 
aspirin 81mg 
[ ] Patient reported attempting to self-taper his alprazolam. He 
was advised to do this under the guidance of a physician. Please 
follow up his benzo use and desire to taper.
[ ] Please ensure close follow up with outpatient dermatology. 
He has had no improvement on Humira thus far and there is strong 
suspicion that this ___ not be PG. Verrucous carcinoma is a 
likely alternative diagnosis. Colorectal surgery recommended 
repeat biopsy, but ___ derm elected to defer repeat biopsy to 
his outpatient provider.

Brief Hospital Course:
On evening of admission, prior fem-fem cutdown site was probed 
by Fellow, who was easily able to palpate the graft. The 
following day, a wound vac was placed on this site. Pt's ray 
incision was packed with iodoform. A LLE ultrasound was obtained 
to evaluate pt's asymmetrical edema and was negative for DVT.   
Pt was seen by her outpt Cardiologist, who recommended a family 
meeting and palliative care consult should pt require a major 
operation. 
On HD 4, a CTA was obtained and demonstrated decreased fluid 
around the graft and an open bypass graft with flow to the foot. 
That night, she tripped on her vac and began to complain of L 
leg pain. 
The following day, pt continued to complain of L leg pain as 
well as SOB. She spiked another fever. Bcx was again sent and a 
CXR demonstrated diffuse interstital edema and small pleural 
effusions. The next day, pt's SOB resolved but her L leg pain 
persisted. Another LLE US found no DVT and a knee x-ray did not 
demonstrate any acute findings. During a vac change, fluid was 
sent and grew E.coli. 
The next day, HD 7, pt's leg pain persisted. Pain meds were 
increased. X-rays from the pelvis down were obtained; they 
showed osteopenia but no fractures or dislocations. A blister 
was noted of the dorsum of her left foot and her antibiotics 
were changed to vancomycin and zosyn (from vanc/cipro/flagyl) to 
better cover streptococcus. The following day the pt's leg pain 
was somewhat improved but the blister on her foot had enlarged. 
A CT scan was obtained and showed edema but no air or abscesses. 

On HD 9, pt's LUE AV graft was unable to be accessed at HD. The 
following day, Interventional Radiology performed a successful 
thrombectomy and venoplasty. On HD 10, a foot XRay was taken, 
which demonstrate a non-displaced ___ metatarsal fracture. 
Podiatry was consulted and recommended no intervention and 
heel-touch only weight bearing status in the left side. The do 
not believe the left foot blister and residual wound is related. 
On HD ___, antibiotic coverage was adjusted to allow for dosing 
only with dialysis, for ease of administration outside the 
hospital. On HD ___ arrangements were made for the patient to be 
discharged to rehab. At the time of discharge, her pain was 
controlled, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding and 
moving her bowels spontaneously. She was sitting up in a chair 
for the large part of the day, but was not yet moving around on 
her own. She should continue physical therapy in rehab to work 
on regaining her mobility.

substernal, burning chest pain that feels like ""fire."" She 
reports this pain has been ongoing and intermittent for months, 
and has been occuring every night for the past few weeks. She 
notes this pain only occurs at night and begins after she lays 
flat to sleep. She reports that it is exacerbated by food. She 
finds herself having to sit almost upright to help relieve her 
pain. She has tried antacids, maalox, and omeprazole with no 
relief. She has also tried nitroglycerin which will relieve her 
pain for about ___ hour, but then the pain returns. She has 
requested oxygen at her last two dialysis sessions which helps 
her and she usually feels better after her HD sessions. She also 
has associated dyspnea along with the pain that is much improved 
with oxygen and sitting in an upright position. 
.
Of note, she was admitted to ___ last in ___ w/ pulmonary 
edema and dyspnea, had a tunneled IJ line placed and was 
initiated on dialysis in the setting of her renal transplant 
failure and volume overload. She was intubated for respiratory 
distress and had good relief with lasix gtt with return of 
adequate oxygen saturations on room air. She was discharged on 
furosemide 80mg BID but reports now that she does not make any 
urine, a few drops if any.  
.
She was evaluated by PCP for this chest pain most recently 5

MICROBIOLOGY
___ MRSA SCREEN: No MRSA isolated
.
IMAGING
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is bilateral diffuse 
reticulonodular opacity in the lower lung fields and 
ground-glass haziness. These findings are compatible with 
pulmonary edema. Dialysis catheter is in unchanged position with 
tip seen in the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. Cluster of 
calcifications in the right mid lung are unchanged. The aorta is 
tortuous and calcified. There is mild cardiomegaly. No definite 
pleural effusions are seen.
.
___ TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
inferior akinesis and near akinesis of the distal half of the 
septum and anterior walls. The apex is aneurysmal and akinetic. 
The remaining segments contract well (LVEF 30%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image 
quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w 
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased 
and global left ventricular systolic function is improved with 
slight decrease in cavity size. Regional left ventricular 
dysfunction is similar.
.
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison with the study of 
___, there has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary 
vascular congestion with the pulmonary vessels now only mildly 
engorged. Minimal atelectatic change is seen at the left base 
and there may be blunting of the costophrenic angle. 
Hemodialysis catheter remains in place.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F w/ CAD s/p MI (in ___ and previous 2 stents in RCA and 
LAD, scleroderma, HTN, ESRD on HD s/p transplant x2, and 
systolic HF (EF ___ who comes in with chronic burning chest 
pain and acute systolic heart failure.
.  
# Acute Systolic CHF: Patient presented with increased dyspnea 
and chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema. Physical exam 
demonstrated rales to mid lung fields. Patient reports increased 
dyspnea prior to dialysis recently and may need change to dry 
weight. She had a session of ultrafiltration the night of 
admission and then a truncated 2-hour session of dialysis the 
following day. In keeping with her outpatient schedule, the pt 
went for a full session of dialysis on ___. ECHO showed an 
EF of 30% and so she was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg 
qHS, with lisinopril 2.5mg to possibly be started as an 
outpatient (and to be titrated up as her blood pressure will 
tolerate it and also to be held on her dialysis days). After her 
dialysis session, pt's symptoms improved, physical exam 
demonstrated clear lung fields, and chest xray showed interval 
improvement in pulmonary edema. 
.
#. Chest Pain/Burning: Pts pain was atypical. Her symptom has 
bothered her each evening for a very long time, and is 
exacerbated when she lies on her back. It is thought to be GI 
related per outpatient providers and will follow up with GI in 
one week. EKG was without changes, and discomfort resolved on 
arrival and with subsequent nitroglycerin. Her cardiac enzymes 
were trended until they peaked. She was put on PPI and carafate, 
which seemed to provide relief of her pain. 
. 
#. ESRD sp transplant on HD: Pt had a session of ultrafiltration 
on the night of admission and was continued on her outpatient 
schedule of dialysis, ___. Her graft is 
well-functioning and her tunneled catheter was pulled. She was 
continued on her home prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus, and 
calcitriol. Her tacrolimus levels were within target. The amount 
of fluid they were able to take off and the length of time spent 
on dialysis was limited by pt's low blood pressure. She will 
continue to have 4 hours of dialysis, three times a week, with 
the next session on ___ and an estimated dry weight of 
67.5kg. 
.   
# CAD: Pt was continued on her home statin and ASA. 
.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was in sinus rhythm, and had no active issues with 
her rhythm during the admission. She was monitored on telemetry
.
#. Normocytic Anemia: At recent baseline. Secondary to ESRD. She 
was continued on Aranesp with dialysis per her outpatient 
regimen and given 1 unit pRBC with an appropriate increase in 
her hematocrit.
.   
# HTN: Blood pressure was well controlled on presentation. She 
was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg qHS, with lisinopril to 
possibly be started as an outpatient as long as her blood 
pressure can tolerate it. Her lisinopril should be held on 
hemodialysis days due to low blood pressures.
.  
# HLD: Pt was continued on her home Lipitor.    
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Recommend initiating lisinopril 2.5mg daily as an outpatient 
as long as her blood pressures can tolerate it. This medication 
should be held on hemodialysis days.
STOP taking calcitriol
START nephrocaps as a vitamin for your kidneys
START pantoprazole twice daily for your heartburn
START carafate up to four times per day for your heartburn, do 
not take this within 1 hour of your other medications
START taking Maalox (calcium and simethicone) as needed for your 
heartburn
START Metoprolol at night to lower your heart rate and avoid 
chest pain.

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 57-year-old female who was admitted with burning chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a history of coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction and stenting, as well as scleroderma, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She was previously a renal transplant recipient, but her current transplant is failing. She was admitted to the hospital with pulmonary edema and dyspnea, and was intubated for respiratory distress. She was started on dialysis and was treated with lasix, which provided relief from her symptoms. She was also prescribed furosemide and omeprazole.

The patient's diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the report, but it appears that she has chronic kidney disease, pulmonary edema, and possibly gastrointestinal issues contributing to her chest pain. She underwent a removal of a tunneled dialysis catheter and was started on CPAP in the emergency department.

At discharge, the patient's medications included furosemide, omeprazole, and possibly other medications not specified in the report. Her physical exam was notable for mild respiratory distress, but she was otherwise stable and comfortable while sitting upright with oxygen. ||endoftext||"

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for alcohol detoxification. We treated you 
with medicines to prevent dangerous withdrawal symptoms and side 
effects.

We also had out social worker and addiction specialists work 
with you to come up with a safe plan for discharge to keep you 
sober.  As you know, it is extremely important that you stop 
drinking to prevent the many terrible effects alcohol can have 
on the body.  As we discussed, this will be difficult, but with 
the proper social supports it is something that you have the 
capability to do.  By continuing to drink, you are only 
increasing the chances of death at a young age.
.
We also tested you for HIV and Hepatitis C, both of which were 
negative.  You had some findings in your mouth that may have 
been thrush (a mild infection), so you should finish 5 days of 
nystatin to treat this.  We have also started you on some 
vitamins, which you should continue to take.
.
Please note the following medication changes:
-Please START thiamine
-Please START multivitamin
-Please START folic acid
-Please START nystatin for 2 more days

Blood Cultures routine and mycolytic NGTD at time of D/C

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended ensure supplementation, 
but pt. did not like ensure and made this clear to nutrition, 
ensure was seen unopened on pt.s tray every morning.
.
#Diarrhea: Likely ___ OI, differential is quite wide: crypto, 
giardia, ___, CMV, C. diff. All previous wkup 
was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with a recent admission 
___ ___ for multifocal pneumonia complicated by chronic 
respiratory failure further complicated recurrent PNA x2 at 
rehab s/p trach/PEG, decannulated on ___. She presented for 
this admission with 2 days of dyspnea and productive cough, and 
was found to be hypoxemic requiring high-flow oxygen. CXR showed 
possible pneumonia and completed course of antibiotics 
(Vanc/ceftazidime, Day 1: ___. Her respiratory failure was 
thought to be secondary to recurrent aspiration related to her 
neuromuscular disease. She was given hypertonic saline nebs, 
guaiafenesin, Duonebs, pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve. She 
required intubation, and was unable to be weaned off the 
ventilator. After numerous goals of care discussions with the 
ICU team, her outpatient pulmonologist, palliative care, and her 
family, decision was made to undergo trach/PEG on ___. She 
tolerated this well, and was able to be weaned off the 
ventilator by ___, when she was transferred to floor. Cuff 
pressures were high, but patient had been tolerating this well. 
She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES
-- NEW: senna PRN and Colace PRN constipation
-- HELD: loperamide (as noted above, consider low dose trial if 
she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools. 
[ ] Continue to discuss goals of care with patient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team

RADIOLOGY
=========
___ 10:12 AM ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)   
FINDINGS:  
Multiple air-fluid levels are seen the right upper and left 
upper quadrant with gaseous distended small and large bowel.  
There may be sigmoid colonic gas.  Pneumobilia is again noted.  
Gastrostomy tube and surgical clips noted in the mid abdomen.  
Densities overlying the lower lumbar vertebral bodies are likely 
from prior vertebroplasties. 
IMPRESSION:  
Bowel gas pattern could represent obstruction or ileus.  
Additional evaluation with CT scan can be considered. 

___ 12:___BD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST   
FINDINGS:  
LOWER CHEST: Bibasilar atelectasis is mild. There is no evidence 
of pleural or pericardial effusion. 
ABDOMEN: 
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions.  Pneumobilia 
is slightly decreased from prior.  Mild intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation is again seen.  The CBD measures up to 1.2 cm (02:18) 
without evidence of choledocholithiasis.  There is air in the 
gall bladder lumen, without stones or gallbladder wall 
thickening. 
PANCREAS: Fatty infiltration of the pancreas seen.  There is no 
evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  
There is no peripancreatic stranding. 
SPLEEN: Splenomegaly is unchanged.  The spleen shows normal 
attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. 
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape. 
URINARY: 1.1 cm right upper pole cortical hypodensity (02:27) is 
unchanged. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of stones or 
hydronephrosis. There are no urothelial lesions in the kidneys 
or ureters. There is no perinephric abnormality. 
GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a small hiatal hernia.  Gastrostomy 
tube tip is in the jejunum.  The patient is status post 
ileocecectomy.  Lack of wall to wall filling of the distal small 
bowel and subsequent apparent wall thickening is likely due to 
mixing artifact. Distal small bowel loops are somewhat dilated, 
up to 3.2 cm, however contrast material is seen in the ascending 
colon and there is air and stool in the colon more distally. 
Colon and rectum are within normal limits.  Prominent mesenteric 
lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT size threshold for 
lymphadenopathy. 
RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy. 
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is 
moderate calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great 
abdominal arteries.  There is a replaced right hepatic artery. 
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. 
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Penile calcifications are again seen.   
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: 
There is no evidence of suspicious lesions.  Osteopenia is 
noted. Multilevel vertebroplasty and right femoral hardware are 
unchanged.  Old gastrostomy tube tract is seen. Right inguinal 
hernia containing fat is again seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Distal small bowel loops are mildly dilated, but enteric 
contrast is seen in the ascending colon and there is air and 
stool in the colon more distally, more suggestive of mild ileus 
rather than bowel obstruction. 
2. Lack of wall to wall filling with oral contrast of the distal 
small bowel and resultant apparent wall thickening is likely due 
to mixing artifact. 
3. The common bile duct measures up to 1.2 cm without evidence 
of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.  Pneumobilia and mild 
intrahepatic biliary dilation are again seen, consistent with 
prior sphincterotomy. 
4. Splenomegaly is unchanged. 
5. 1.1 cm right renal hypodensity is unchanged.  Continued 
attention is recommended on future exams. 

___ 2:46 ___ ESOPHAGUS
FINDINGS:  
Esophagus was not dilated and no extrinsic mass was identified.  
The esophageal mucosa appears normal. 
The primary peristaltic wave was broken in the mid esophagus 
with many tertiary contractions.  An 13 mm barium tablet was 
administered with a few seconds of hold up in the lower 
esophagus, reproducing the patient's symptomatology.  The pill 
passed into the stomach uneventfully with termination of the 
patient's symptoms. 
Limited visualization of the stomach is unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Esophageal dysmotility with prominent tertiary waves, 
consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm.
2.  The patient's symptomatology was reproduced momentarily 
while the barium tablet passed through the gastroesophageal 
junction. 

___ 10:41 AM CHEST (PA & LAT)   
FINDINGS:  
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is a right-sided 
PICC line with tip in the distal SVC.  There is volume loss/ 
infiltrate in the left lower lobe that is new compared to prior 
again seen and more conspicuous than on the prior study are 
multiple mildly dilated loops of bowel.  The patient had a 
contrast-enhanced CT 1 day ago and therefore there is contrast 
outlining many of these loops of bowel.  However with unusual is 
that in many areas it appears that both the inside and outside 
of the bowel wall is visualized.  There is no other evidence of 
free air and therefore this is likely an artifact of the manner 
in which the contrast has been distributed   
IMPRESSION:  
Volume loss/ infiltrate in the left lower lobe mildly dilated 
loops of small bowel with unusual appearance to the bowel wall.  
A followup upright film to exclude free air would be helpful 

___ 1:03 ___ ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)   
FINDINGS:  
Again seen is contrast outlining bowel loops.  At this point in 
time most of contrast is in the colon.  There are multiple 
air-fluid levels in the small bowel which is nondilated.  A 
gastric tube is visualized pneumobilia is present no free air is 
identified   
IMPRESSION:  
Ileus versus partial SBO 

___ 3:44 ___ UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT   
FINDINGS:  
There is normal flow with respiratory variation in the bilateral 
subclavian veins. 
The right internal jugular and axillary veins are patent and 
compressible with transducer pressure. 
The right brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins are patent, 
compressible with transducer pressure and show normal color flow 
and augmentation.  A PICC is seen in a right brachial vein.   
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper 
extremity. 

PATHOLOGY

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of diabetes 
type 2 uncontrolled complicated by neuropathy, Crohn's disease 
s/p ileocecectomy and multiple laparotomies for SBO, chronic 
diarrhea and recurrent pseudo-obstructions prompting venting 
G-Jtube, admitted ___ w diarrhea and abdominal distention 
thought to represent partial small bowel obstruction, with long 
hospital course course notable for intermittent intolerance of 
tube feeds, subsequently requiring initiation of TPN after long 
discussions with patient and GI service, now tolerating well, 
having regular bowel movements without signs of obstruction or 
diarrhea, discharged home with TPN; 

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Intermittent Small Bowel Obstructions / Diarrhea / Abdominal 
pain / Crohn's Disease / Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth - 
On presentation, the patient had acutely worsened diffuse 
chronic abdominal pain on presentation. Subsequent workup 
supported multifactorial causes including likely intermittent 
partial small bowel obstructions, osmotic diarrhea from dietary 
indiscretions (eating lots of starburst candies) and Crohn's 
disease.  Initial concern was for SBO. He had a CT with PO and 
IV contrast that showed mild ileus. However, there was some 
thickening of the bowel wall that initially raised concern for 
Crohn's flare (on subsequent revised read, the thickening was 
deemed artifact). Subsequently, he had a colonoscopy that showed 
ulceration at his colonic-colonic anastomosis with biopsies 
showing terminal ileum inflammation. Given that the results were 
suggestive of Crohn's, the patient was started on budesonide 9mg 
PO daily. Furthermore, in working up his diarrhea, which 
improved with no oral intake, he was found to have a stool Osm 
gap of 357-2*(70+24.3) = 168, which suggested an osmotic 
diarrhea. When tube feed was initiated (see below), his diarrhea 
worsened to over 10 times overnight. Eventually, given that he 
had a borderline SIBO breath test in the past, he was started on 
rifaximin empirically for SIBO treatment. When he started TPN 
(see below), his diarrhea improved to 4 BMs per day.

# Acute Protein Calorie Malnutrition - Patient with > 20lb weigh 
loss over last 6 months.  He had intermittent symptoms as above, 
but failed trials of starting on tube feed on 4 separate 
attempts due to abdominal pain, distension and diarrhea.  He was 
tried on several formulations without improvement. Patient 
educated on risks/benefits of TPN.  Ultimately, he was started 
on TPN via R PICC access. He will eventually need consideration 
for a Port-A-Cath if he is to continue TPN long term--given the 
uncertainty about how long he would require TPN, port not placed 
this admission.  He tolerated TPN well with no electrolyte 
abnormalities and signs of refeeding syndrome. He was giving 
thiamine intermittently throughout his hospitalization with 
tubefeed and TPN. 

# Dysphagia | Esophageal Spasm - The patient reported 
significant swallowing issues during his stay and refused to 
take in POs, including pills. He had a barium swallow study that 
showed findings consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm. GI 
consult team wanted to follow up with manometry testing as 
outpatient before starting therapy. Fortunately, his symptoms 
improved during the course of his stay, and he requested 
trialing PO food and was able to tolerate small amount of POs on 
discharge.

# Chronic Back Pain | Chronic Abdominal Pain - Due to NPO 
status, he was given IV hydromorphone in place of his PO regimen 
at home for the most part of his stay. The patient requested on 
multiple occasions to speak with the Pain specialists here. The 
Pain Consult team saw the patient and recommended uptitration of 
gabapentin to 900mg TID for chronic pain and maintaining his 
home narcotics regimen. The team discussed with the patient that 
his abdominal pain can possibly be attributed to his high 
narcotics requirement leading to narcotics bowel syndrome. The 
patient was very reluctant to the idea of decreasing his pain 
medications, stating that without them, he cannot have a normal 
life and wants to have a life. He was discharged on his home 
regimen, but with the understanding that if abdominal symptoms 
should recur or persist, he may need to consider downtitration 
of opiates. He reported needing more hydromorphone despite 
having filled a recent prescription for a 1 month supply only 2 
weeks prior to admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension: The patient's BPs had been well controlled 
throughout his admission up until the last part of his stay, 
when he had elevated BPs to 180s at times. His home labetalol 
regimen was uptitrated to 400mg TID from 300mg TID. It's 
possible this is due to switching from IV hydromorphone to PO.

# COPD: No symptoms while hospitalized. He continued home 
inhaler regimen. 

# Diabetes Mellitus: Complicated by neuropathy. Patient endorsed 
neuropathic pain in his feet. He continue home Gabapentin liquid 
as tolerated.

# Coronary Artery Disease: He had no symptoms. He continued ASA 
and labetalol. Lisinopril was DC'ed as outpatient due to labile 
blood pressures.
  
# Anxiety/Depression: The patient's overall mood was stable but 
he became tearful at times when discussing his chronic illness. 
He continue home lorazepam, buproprion, and buspirone.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- TPN: Will need ongoing evaluation of his nutritional 
requirement.
- Access: Patient currently has a PICC for TPN administration. 
If he will be on TPN for a long time, please consider placing a 
Port for longer term access.
- Antibiotics: Will need to continue taking rafaximin 550mg PO 
TID for 7 days, until ___.
- Pain: Patient has been having ongoing issues with abdominal 
pain. His gabapentin was uptitrated to 900mg TID per the 
recommendations of Pain consult team.
- Hypertension: Patient's BP was low earlier during stay but 
became elevated towards the end (160s), likely due to no longer 
receiving IV pain medication. His labetalol was uptitrated to 
400mg TID. Please consider another antihypertensive agent since 
his heart rate is only ___ at discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after having increasing difficulty 
with maintaining nutrition at home and increasing abdominal 
pain. We performed a CT scan that ruled out a small bowel 
obstruction. We performed a colonoscopy that showed inflammation 
at your anastamosis site, for which we are treating you with 
budesonide, an oral steroid. Furthermore, for your difficulty 
swallowing, we found some signs of esophageal dysmotility on a 
barium study. Fortunately, your symptoms improved without any 
intervention.

Despite our best attempts to start nutrition with tube feed, we 
were unsuccessful. Therefore, we eventually decided to start 
total parenteral nutrition, which you will need to continue on 
until you are able to better tolerate eating by mouth. Last, we 
tried to optimize your diarrhea by trialing you on an 
antibiotics to treat bacteria overgrowth in the small bowel.

Your blood pressure was elevated towards the end of your 
hospitalization. We increased your home dose of labetalol, and 
you will need to follow up with Dr. ___ further 
titration.

Please check your finger sticks at home so that we can monitor 
your glucose level and determine whether you need insulin in 
your TPN.

It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the best!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of weight loss. He has a history of Crohn's disease, multiple laparotomies, and short gut syndrome, which has led to complications such as intermittent small bowel obstruction and dependence on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He also has a history of chronic abdominal pain, depression, and anxiety. On admission, his physical examination revealed a diffusely tender abdomen with mild rebound tenderness, and his laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein. He was diagnosed with a possible small bowel obstruction and was treated with nebulizer therapy and oral steroids. At discharge, his vital signs were stable, and his physical examination revealed a mild firmness and diffusely tender abdomen. His laboratory results showed improvement in his white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, but his albumin and calcium levels remained low. He was prescribed medications for his chronic pain and was advised to follow up with his primary care physician.

IMAGING:
-___ KUB: 1. No overt radiologic evidence of small-bowel 
obstruction or ileus 2. Nasoenteric tube with the tip likely 
projecting over the region consistent with body of the stomach. 

-___ CXR:1. New moderately large left and small right pleural 
effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis. 2. Satisfactory 
position of peripherally inserted central venous catheter.  

-___ Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis in bilateral 
kidneys.

-___ CXR: Increased density at the left base consistent with 
parenchymal 
consolidation. Bilateral pleural effusions may obscure the 
underlying 
pulmonary opacities. There is no definite change. 

-___ CT ABD &Pelvis: 1. Partially rim-enhancing fluid 
collection within the anterior midline abdomen in close 
proximity to the transverse colon surgical chain sutures. 
Underlying superinfection cannot be excluded and the collection 
is amenable to needle aspiration if needed.  2. No findings of 
bowel obstruction or leak. Persistent but slightly improved 
edematous appearance of the remaining large bowel when compared 
to the outside ___ exam. 3. Nonspecific enhancement 
and fluid in the right paracolic gutter. While this may 
represent post-procedural change, underlying peritoneal disease 
is also possible in this patient with known metastatic disease. 
4. Renal cysts including a hyperdense cyst off the left lower 
pole. 5. Bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion. 


-___ CXR: In comparison with study of ___, the right base 
shows substantial clearing with moderate atelectatic streaking 
and probable small effusion. On the left, however, there is 
still extensive opacification consistent with pleural effusion, 
atelectasis, and possibly supervening pneumonia in the 
appropriate clinical setting. 

-___ CT abd: 1. Slight interval decrease in size to partially 
organized intra-abdominal fluid collection within the midline 
abdomen which is of higher density today and may suggest 
decreasing phlegmon or evolving hematoma. A small amount of air 
within this collection is likely related to recent attempted 
aspiration. No new fluid collections or extraluminal oral 
contrast is present. 2. Persistent edema and wall thickening 
involving the visualized large bowel, most pronounced in the 
region of the splenic flexure. Slight interval worsening of 
small bowel wall thickening and mesenteric induration in the 
left upper quadrant. This may reflect postoperative change, 
serositis, and/or tumor infiltration. No bowel obstruction. 3. 
Interval increase in moderate-size simple left pleural effusion 
resulting in complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe. 4. 
Fatty liver. 

-___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, left PICC line 
is in 
unchanged position. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has 
almost 
completely resolved. The pre-existing left pleural effusion 
shows a slightly different distribution but is overall unchanged 
in extent. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac 
atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. 

-___ CT chest: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. Moderate left and 
trace right pleural effusions with overlying pulmonary 
atelectasis. 3. Bilateral prominent hilar lymph nodes as well as 
numerous, though not frankly enlarged upper mediastinal and 
supraclavicular lymph nodes. Close attention to these areas is 
recommended given the history of known malignancy. 

-___ CT abd: Limited study without intravenous or enteric 
contrast 
demonstrating post-operative changes with no definable 
intra-abdominal fluid collection for drainage. 

-___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of 
the 
pre-existing left pleural effusion is unchanged. A minimal right 
pleural 
effusion is newly visualized. Moderate bilateral basal 
atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. 
Unchanged course of the left PICC line. No pulmonary edema. No 
focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia 

-___ CT chest:1. Despite evidence of aspiration, attributable to 
the over distended esophagus, the large areas of consolidation 
at the lung bases, by virtue of their persistence and relative 
homogeneity, are indistinguishable as either atelectasis alone 
or atelectasis and pneumonia. There is no pneumonia in the upper 
or middle lobes. Persistent bilateral pleural effusion, moderate 
on the left and small on the right. 

-___ CT chest, abd and pelvis: 1. No evidence of PE. Mild 
pulmonary edema and increased bilateral pleural effusions. 
Bilateral lower lobe bronchial mucoid impaction and atelectasis; 
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  2. Small bowel 
ileus, with patent ileostomy.  3. Intact ___ pouch, with 
apparent mild wall thickening. Please correlate for inflammatory 
or infectious colitis. 4. Mild ascites, partially loculated in 
anterior omentum. Irregular enhancement may represent 
inflammation or peritoneal metastasis. 5. Emphysema and 
pulmonary hypertension. 

-___ CXR: 1. Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe 
collapse and/or consolidation, similar or possibly slightly 
worse. 2. Interval resolution right effusion, but new plate-like 
right base atelectasis 
.
Tissue biospy pathology:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with metastatic papillary serous 
ovarian CA who was transferred from ___ with SBO. She had 
exp laparotomy on ___ where a perforated transverse colon was 
found; a R extended hemicolectomy and end ileostomy was 
performed, with L colon no longer in continuity with GI tract. 
This surgery was reported to be uneventful with minimal blood 
loss but some intra-peritoneal intra-peritoneal spillage. She 
was transferred to ICU for post-op monitoring given severity of 
comorbidities.
.
Given the concern for intraoperative spillage, she was started 
on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Fluconazole for planned five day course 
(day ___ this was broadened to Vancomycin, Meropenem, 
Ciprofloxacin and Fluconazole (day ___ when she was found to 
have developed a concomitant pneumonia. Her pain was treated 
with a Dilaudid PCA and she was kept NPO with TPN post-surgery. 
She was also continued on IV Bblocker and IV PPI post surgery.
.
The patient remained hypoxic after her surgery, with high 
supplemental oxygen need, thought to be due to splinting from 
abdominal pain as well as pneumonia; she was treated with 
antibiotics as above. She initially had acute renal failure with 
poor urine output but this improved with volume resuscitation. 
.
This patient has known metastatic ovarian cancer and was on 
weekly Avastin/Taxol prior to GI perforation. She was given one 
dose of neupagen on ___ after surgery; this was stopped after 
discussing with Gyn/Onc. Gyn/Onc will further direct her 
oncologic treatment, with social work and pastoral care 
following. 
.
Patient was transferred to the floor on ___ after oxygen 
requirement was tapered to 6L. Patient was diuresed with IV 
lasix and TPN was halved. She was advanced from clear liquids to 
regular diet over the following two days with TPN discontinued. 
Patient's ostomy showed normal outputs with appropriate gas. On 
___, the superior pole of the abdominal incision was noted 
to be erythematous with clear drainage. 3 staples were removed, 
cultures sent, and wound was packed. Gram stain showed no 
organisms. Wound was monitored and anitbiotics continued. Given 
the appearance of the wound and persistent elevated EBC count, 
CT abdomen was performed to assess for abdominal fluid 
collection which revealed a small anterior fluid collection in 
the superior abdomen. ___ was consulted but the collection was 
too small to drain. Follow up CT scans were performed to see 
progression of collection with gradual resolution noted on 
imaging. Over the next several days, superior abdominal wound 
opened further with fascial dehiscence noted in wound and 
drainage of purulent fluid. Wound was packed with aquacel and 
drainage decreased over time. 

As wound improved, persistent leukocytosis raised concern for 
cdiff colitis. Patient was started on empiric flagyl and a 
sigmoidoscopy was performed to assess remnant colon for 
pseudomembranes, with none seen. Flagyl was stopped once 3 cdiff 
cultures were negative. On ___, patient was complaining of 
significant muscle cramping, refractory to diazepam. One dose of 
tizanidine was given and patient was overly sedated. She was 
monitored closely with no change in respiratory function, though 
she was drowsy. Once tizanidine wore off, she was active with no 
mental slowing. Tizanidine was not given and diazepam was 
stopped.

On ___, patient reported severe dyspnea and tachycardia and a 
CTA chest was performed to rule out PE. Scan was negative and 
patient's dyspnea was releived with nebulizer treatments and 
supplemental oxygen. A similar episode occured on ___, and a 
repeat CTA chest was performed in light of patient's high risk 
due to cancer, and immbolization. Repeat scan was also negative. 
On ___, interventional pulmonology was consulted for 
therapeutic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in hopes of 
improving patient's dyspnea. 400 cc of seroud fluid was drained, 
with no bacterial growth, and chemistries consistent with 
transudate. Her dyspnea improved significantly after this, 
though she occasionally had episodes of dyspnea and tachycardia, 
presumably from anxiety.

Over the next ___ days, patient's leukocytosis stabilized around 
16 and her oxygen requirement resolved. She worked with physical 
therapy and po intake was encourage. 
Calorie count revealed inadequate calories intake. Her nutrition 
was supplemented with ensure shakes. 

At discharge, pt felt well. She was discharged on hospital 
day#28/post-operative day #26 in stable condition: afebrile, 
able to eat regular food, under adequate pain control with oral 
medications, and ambulating with ___ and urinating without 
difficulty.

Discharge Instructions:
___ were admitted to the hospital after emergency surgery for 
your colon perforation from your ovarian cancer. ___ have 
recovered from this procedure well and ___ are now ready to 
finish your recovery in rehab. 

___ have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed 
with staples. This incision can be left open to air or covered 
with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become 
irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until 
your first post-operative visit at which time they can be 
removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please 
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if ___ develop a 
fever. Please call the office if ___ develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.  ___ may 
shower and let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel; do not rub.

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___ may 
gradually increase your activity as tolerated but avoid heavy 
exercise. 

___ may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take 
more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while 
taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive 
a car while taking narcotic pain medication.

___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a 
new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the 
stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is 
very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large 
intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed 
into the body and the stool becomes formed. ___ must measure 
your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from 
the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If 
___ find that your output has become too much or too little, 
please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse 
practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the 
ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated. If ___ notice 
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink 
such as gatoraide. Please monitor yourself for signs and 
symptoms of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon 
standing), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If ___ 
notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the 
emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ 
may eat a modified regular diet with your new ileostomy.

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care 
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ stoma 
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be 
beefy red or pink. It may ooze small amounts of blood at times 
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around 
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the 
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed 
above. Please care for the ostomy as ___ have been instructed by 
the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ will be able to make an appointment 
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic after surgery. ___ will have 
nurses at rehab for the next few weeks helping to monitor your 
ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own.

Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual 
activities. Good luck!

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 58-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. She had a history of recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer and had undergone multiple surgeries and chemotherapy treatments. She was initially diagnosed with stage IIC ovarian cancer and had received carboplatin and Taxol therapy until she developed a carboplatin allergy. She was then switched to Doxil and later started on Arimidex. She had been stable until she developed abdominal pain, concern for acute appendicitis, and underwent laparoscopic evaluation, which revealed several carcinoma implants along both hemidiaphragms, the right lobe of the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and appendix.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy and end ileostomy. She was found to have small bowel pneumatosis and was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for sepsis. She was also found to have rising CA-125 levels and was initiated on carboplatin therapy. However, she developed a carboplatin allergy and was switched to Doxil.

The patient's past medical history is significant for recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer, osteopenia, and a family history of CAD and ovarian cancer. Her physical exam revealed abdominal tenderness, absent bowel sounds, and a Foley catheter in place draining clear urine.

The patient's discharge medications included vanc/zosyn, and her discharge labs showed elevated WBC count, AST, and ALT levels. Her imaging studies revealed a partially rim-enhancing fluid collection within the anterior midline abdomen, no findings of bowel obstruction or leak, and bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.

In summary, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer who underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy and end ileostomy due to abdominal pain and concern for acute appendicitis. She was found to have small bowel pneumatosis and was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for sepsis. She was also found to have rising CA-125 levels and was initiated on carboplatin therapy, but developed a carboplatin allergy and was switched to Doxil. ||endoftext||"

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. You had a rigid 
bronchoscopy (procedure to look in your lungs) with cryptherapy 
and electrocautery to help open your airways and improve your 
breathing. After the procedure you had shortness of breath and 
likely had a blockage of your airway from a mucous plug or blood 
clot. You were admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation 
(breathing mask) and respiratory monitoring. Your breathing 
improved tremendously overnight and your x-ray showed 
improvement. You also received steroids after the procedure, 
which were subsequently stopped. 

The Interventional Pulmonology team was very involved in your 
care, and felt that your breathing was greatly improved and you 
were safe for discharge, with follow-up in clinic in one month 
with a CT scan of your airways. 

We did not change any of your medications. 

Please follow-up at your appointments below.

Followup Instructions:

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted with a chief complaint of left thigh bleeding. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, COPD, and prior DVT. She was previously treated with Lovenox and was admitted to the hospital with an arterial bleed into her thigh, which required embolization of the left medial femoral circumflex artery. The patient's bleeding resolved with the application of Surgicel and direct pressure, but she experienced recurrent bleeding when she got up to use the bathroom. A CT scan revealed a fluid collection with surrounding stranding, consistent with an abscess. The patient was treated with antibiotics and was advised to remain non-weightbearing. She was also prescribed medications including acetaminophen, furosemide, levothyroxine, and valacyclovir.

The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, hypothyroidism, COPD, and prior DVT. She also has a history of breast cancer, asthma, and ocular herpes. Her social history is significant for a motor vehicle accident in which she believes part of her skull was removed.

The patient's physical examination revealed a firm hematoma in her left upper thigh, as well as a chronic appearing wound with no active bleeding. Her vital signs were stable, and her laboratory results showed a decrease in her hemoglobin level. The patient was advised to remain non-weightbearing and to follow up with her primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old right handed ___ driver with an unknown medical 
history was found in his truck confused by the police on the 
morning of admission. According to the patient, he has nausea 
last night, which continued until this morning. He also had a 
bifrontal throbbing headache, which continues to be present. He 
is not sure whether the headache came on suddenly. He does not 
know why he was found in his truck with a laceration above his 
right eye, and a dislocated right middle finger.  It was 
hypothesized he may have had a seizure resulting in mild trauma 
and possible contra-coup injury (right frontal trauma with left 
posterior temporal contusion).  Other possibilities included 
arteriovenous malformation or underlying mass.  The patient was 
admitted to the neurology ICU for further management.
.
Hospital Course by problem;
.
Neuro; The patient was loaded on keppra upon admission and 
continued at 1000 mg bid.  He was monitored initially with q1h 
neurochecks.  His systolic blood pressure was maintained between 
100-140 without intervention.  A repeat CT head showed a stable 
intraparenchymal and small subdural hematoma.  MRI brain showed 
no evidence of underlying mass.  A CTA showed no sign of 
vascular malformation.  The patient will undergo repeat MRI 
brain with and without contrast in ___ weeks for further 
evaluation of his hemorrhage.  He will continue on keppra at 
1000 mg bid for at least six months.  The patient was 
transferred to the neurology floor on HD#2.  There he was 
evaluated by ___ who found that he was stable and able to 
ambulate without assistance. A repeat head CT on ___ showed no 
change in the intraparenchymal or subdural bleeds. He did not 
have any seizure activity while in house.
.
MSK; The patient was found to have a dislocation of his right 
middle finger which was subsequently reduced. This was splinted 
and did not cause him significant pain
.
CV/Pulm/Renal/GI: the patient was stable from a cardiac, 
pulmonary, renal and GI standpoint. He tolerated a regular diet 
without issues, he made adequate urine and did not have any 
desaturations.

On HD 5 the patient felt well and a repeat head CT showed no 
evolving process. He was anxious to return home to ___ 
as his family had finally arrived in ___. He will take all 
hospital documents with him and tranfer his care down to PA near 
his family. At the time of discharge he was ambulating without 
assistance, tolerating a regular diet but did have some 
persistent confusion. However, he and his family understood the 
gravity of his problem and certified that he would arrange 
follow up care with neurology and neurosurgery upon his return 
to ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the 
gynecology service after undergoing and IV guided drainage of a 
tuboovarian abscess noted on her left adnexa. Please see the 
operative report for full details.

Her immediate post op course was complicated by low grade fevers 
on post-operative day 1 and 2 and IV antibiotics were broadened 
to include gentamycin, clindamycin, and ampicillin. On post-op 
day 2, patient had an elevated WBC with increasing left shift 
and repeat pelvic ultrasound and CT pelvis with contrast was 
performed. Imaging was notable for a decreased left adnexal 
fluid collection of 3cm (decreased from 6cm on admission) and a 
new right rim-enhancing 1.3cm and 0.9 collection on the right 
adnexa. Interventional radiology was re-consulted but given 
improvement of WBC count and clinical improvement, additional 
drainage deferred. On post-op day 3, she was transitioned to PO 
levofloxacin and metronidazole. Patient remained afebrile and 
felt subjectively improved. 

During her stay she was noted to have negative gonorrhea, 
chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and HIV tested. Tumor markers were 
noted to be within normal limits. The fluid drained from her 
left adnexal mass grew no microorganisms and urine cultures were 
negative. 

On post-operative day 3, she was voiding spontaneously, her diet 
was advanced without difficulty, and she was transitioned to 
oral pain medications and oral antibiotocs.She was then 
discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up 
scheduled.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service for 
evaluation and treatment.  On ___, the patient underwent left 
carotid endarterectomy, which went well without complication 
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the 
floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and oxycodone 
for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received oxycodone and tylenol with good 
effect and adequate pain control.  

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. An artertial 
line was initially placed for close blood pressure monitoring. 
He was continued on all home medications including beta-blocker. 
Home ace-inhibitor was restarted POD1.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Foley catheter 
was removed at midnight POD0 and the patient voided. Following 
foley catheter placement, hematuria was noted. It cleared over 
the postoperative course. Urology recommended the patient be 
seen by his outpatient urologist given his history of bladder 
cancer. This was commnunicated to the patient and his wife and 
daughter directly.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection.   

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required. INR was checked POD1 
after coumadin was held POD0. It was restarted on his home 
dosing regimen POD1. Communication with his PCP who manages his 
coumadin as an outpatient was made prior to discharge and 
followup INR check and coumadin dosing was established. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female who comes to see 
Dr.
___ for second opinion. She developed illness in ___ 
___ where abnormal CXR led to CT chest which was followed since
every six months revealing in ___ stable bilateral
parenchymal nodules. A persistent soft tissue density in left
posterobasal segment bronchus was seen, along with left thyroid
stable hypodense nodules. This prompted further workup with
bronchoscopy on ___ revealing a left posterior basal segment
nodular endobronchial lesion. This was positive for carcinoid.
LLL BAL was negative. The pateint refused early bronchoscopy in
___ due to ""nerves"". Also noted on bronch was a posterior
tracheal wall invagination or submucosal nodule, and stenosis of
the right middle lobe. 
She underwent further evaluation with PET CT ___ which was
negative for uptake. MR neck was done on ___ to further
identify the subcarinal lesion in trachea, which was not 
biopsied
during bronch due to concern for bleeding. The MR revealed no
upper tracheal mass below the right vocal cords. There appeared
to be slight asymmetry and fullness in the region of the right
palatine tonsil to the right of the uvula and soft palate of
unknown significance. Visual inspection was recommended. An
enhancing left thyroid lesion corresponds to the hypodense 
nodule
on CT chest ___. No further diagnostic workup was done on her
thyroid.

The patient suffers from anxiety which she reports gives her
cough, palpitations and GI complaints. Once she is calm she 
feels
fine without fevers, chills, nightsweats, dyspnea or cough. She

Imaging
CXR ___: IMPRESSION: Left chest tube removed. No pneumothorax.

CXR ___: FINDINGS: No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is 
within normal limits. Left chest tube is in place without 
pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with 
atelectasis and effusion, though in the appropriate clinical 
setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. 
Minimal opacification obscuring the right heart border could 
represent atelectasis or developing middle lobe consolidation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who initially presented 
with severe abdominal pain. At that time, no obvious findings on 
CT scan and no obvious leak was appreciated. Given her pain and 
significant CT findings, it was decided that she would benefit 
from a diagnostic laparoscopy. At that time, I was concerned 
that she may actually have a gastric perforation and may have a 
gallbladder issue that could potentially be addressed 
laparoscopically. Thus, we decided to start the case 
laparoscopically with potential conversion to an open procedure 
if a significant
lesion in the stomach was appreciated. The risks and benefits of 
the procedure were described in detail to the patient. Despite 
these risks, she chose to proceed with surgery. She was found to 
have a gastric perforation and therefore converted to 
exploratory laparotomy with ___ patch and placement of a 
Pravena vac. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a IV dialudid 
PCA and then transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone 
once tolerating a diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression and nasojejunal 
tube in place for feeding.  On POD2 tube feeding were started 
through the doboff. On POD3 the NGT was accidently  removed by 
the patient when sneezing. She was kept NPO (except tube feeds). 
On POD5 she underwent upper GI leak test that was unclear and 
therefore was repeated on POD7 and negative for leak. Doboff was 
removed and she was given a regular diet with good tolerability. 
H.Pylori result was positive and therefore she was started on 
quadruple therapy once tolerating a diet. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. H.Pylori quadrupal therapy 
started and prescribed 2 week course. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

(History of crohns), recent admission to ___ on ___ with 
SBO for which she underwent exlap, LOA, reduction of internal 
hernia c/b abdominal wall soft tissue necrosis/infection 
followed failed abdominal graft (___) who presented from 
___ for G-tube replacement.

She was sent in from ___ after G-tube fell out 
yesterday. Per one of the nurses at the ___ facility, 
they are unaware of how the G tube came out. They went to 
evaluate her around 3PM and the G-tube was out. Her last 
recorded blood glucose at the facility prior to presentation to 
the hospital was 225 at 4:30 ___. Otherwisae the nursing staff 
reports no changes in her baseline status prior to leaving and 
no history of recent complaints. 

Upon presentation to the ED the patient complained of abdominal 
pain both around her ileostomy site that she described as 
burning and around her PEG tube site. The denied nausea, emesis, 
or increased ostomy output although patient has a very soft 
spoken voice and was at times difficult to understand. She 
denied chest pain or shortness of breath. No painful urination 
reported in the
ED. 

In the ED she was found to have hyperglycemia, ___, 
hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic acidosis with concern 
for intraabdominal infection. 

She was started on insulin gtt and given IVF out of concern for 
DKA, but UA did not show ketones. Started CTX/Flagyl for UTI. CT 
abdomen did not show fluid collections but did show hepatic 
lesions concerning for hepatic infarction.

Of note, she had a recent admission to ___ on ___ with SBO 
for which she underwent exlap, LOA, reduction of internal hernia 
c/b abdominal wall soft tissue necrosis, infection, and ultimate 
loss, leaving her with a large subcutaneous peristomal wound. 
She was then readmitted from ___ for from PTSG harvested 
from left thigh but unfortunately the abdominal graft failed. 

On arrival to the ICU, the patient endorses abdominal pain 
diffusely, denies nausea or vomiting. Endorses pain around her 
g-tube site and ileostomy site. Says that she does have burning 
with urination. Endorsing discomfort from Foley. Endorses 
chronic back pain. Denies fevers, CP, SOB.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with complicated past medical history 
including CVA s/p hemicraniectomy, TAC with end ileostomy 
(History of crohns), recent admission to ___ on ___ with 
SBO for which she underwent exlap, LOA, reduction of internal 
hernia c/b abdominal wall soft tissue necrosis/infection 
followed failed abdominal graft (___) who presented from 
___ rehab for G-tube replacement, found to have 
hyperglycemia, ___, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic 
acidosis. She was admitted to the FICU for closer monitoring 
with improvement in her AGMA, resulting in transfer to medicine 
service. Ultimately the end of her hospitalization involved 
adjustments of her insulin and tube feeding regimen in order to 
obtain adequate glycemic control. 

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis
# Respiratory acidosis
# Lactic acidosis
Patient presented with elevated lactate and AGMA. The suspect 
etiology was hypovolemia with improvement in lactate after 4L 
IVF. There was brief increase in lactate to 5 while in ICU but 
this was felt to be a spurious value with improvement after 1L 
of IVF. No evidence of ketones in urine to suggest DKA despite 
elevated glucose on presentation. Patient remained normotensive 
in FICU with improvement in AGMA and downtrend in lactate. Given 
stability, she was transferred to medicine service.  She 
remained stable during her stay. Anion gap closed. 

# G-tube
# Nutrition
G-tube dislodged at outside facility. Surrounding erythema and 
tenderness. Plastic surgery and wound consult evaluated the site 
and were not concerned by its appearance. ___ was consulted for 
G-tube replacement and the existing tube was put back in place.  
Her tube feeds were restarted and advanced to goal.  She was 
able to tolerate a full regular diet before discharge, but not 
quite at goal in terms of nutrition. As such her tube feeds are 
currently running continuous, and as a result her insulin 
regimen, outlined below, needed titration. Initially she was 
also placed on a pureed solid/thin liquid diet however this was 
advanced to soft solids/thin liquids before discharge. Once able 
to take sufficient PO intake, her tube feeds may be changed to 
Glucerna 1.2 @ 60 mL/hr x12hours w/ Juven TID ___ kcal, 50 g 
protein, 1590 mL free water), with monitoring of sodium and 
hydration status; adjust flushes prn. Her insulin will also need 
titration as her tube feeds are adjusted. 

# Concern for aspiration
Several days ago was found to have food in her mouth. SLP 
recommending pureed solids with thin liquids, Meds crushed in 
applesauce via tube, 1:1 feeds. Patient very unhappy with this 
change, SLP re-evaluated and recommended soft solids with thin 
liquids. Hopefully this will help with augmentation of her PO 
intake. 

# Diabetes with hyperglycemia
Glucose in the 500s on presentation. Started on insulin drip in 
ED, transitioned to SC. No ketones on UA, Beta-OH wnl.  She was 
given her home glargine and sliding scale insulin, but had blood 
sugar 300s.  ___ was consulted and increased her home Lantus 
and Humalog. Ultimately, likely due to continuous tube feeding 
rather than cycled, her insulin requirements went up 
significantly. At the time of discharge she is requiring the 
following: 
-lantus 70 units BID
-Humalog q4hrs with scale: 
71-100: 0 units
101-150: 12 units
151-200: 17 units
201-250: 22 units
251-300: 27 units
301-350: 32 units
351-400: 37 units
>400: 42 units
Her sugars have been running in the high 200-low 300s by the 
time of discharge (significantly improved). Anticipate that as 
her PO feeds pick up and tube feeds become night time 
only/cycled, she could go back to her home insulin regimen 
(lantus 50 units BID, Humalog 16 units TIDWM). For now, she will 
need q4hrs Humalog until continuous tube feeds are 
stopped/tapered off.  

# Pyuria
# Urinary tract infection: Endorsed dysuria on admission.  UA 
was positive, but urine culture was negative.  Empiric 
ceftriaxone was started and stopped.

# Abdominal wound
# Abdominal pain
Patient presented with abdominal pain. Exam notable for 
significant erythema surrounding ileostomy site and abdominal 
wound. CT scan without evidence for abdominal pain. At this 
point, suspect that her abdominal pain is related to the skin 
erythema.  Plastic surgery and wound care were consulted and 
provided recommendations for wound care. 

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis recently. Possibly related to hepatic 
infarction (infarction vs geographic fat on CT), but ultrasound 
shows main and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal 
flow. Hepatitis B and C serologies were sent and were negative. 
Plan was to continue to trend LFTs. 

# Acute kidney injury: Likely pre-renal. Improved with IV 
fluids.

# Hypercalcemia: Suspect related to dehydration and immobility. 
Improved with IV fluids. Ca2+ 10.7 on the day of discharge, will 
need monitoring periodically with tube feeding. 

# Hypertension: amlodipine and metoprolol were initially held 
while she was critically ill and as she remained normotensive 
these were not resumed. If/when BP starts to trend up, would 
resume these. HR around the ___, so could consider Metoprolol 
first, but might consider starting at lower doses than she had 
been on before. 

# h/o CVA w/ residual asphasia and right hemiplegia: patient was 
continued on her home baclofen, gabapentin, and lidocaine patch

# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: patient was given 
duonebs and albuterol prn

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin

# Depression: continued amitriptyline

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis recently. Possibly related to hepatic 
infarction (infarction vs geographic fat on CT), but ultrasound 
shows main and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal 
flow.
- hepatitis serologies negative
- abdominal exam benign 
- outpatient follow up 
- LFTs trended down slightly before discharge, will need repeats 
in ___ weeks to ensure stable/trending down 

TRANSITIONS OF CARE
-------------------
# Follow-up: patient will return to rehab and will need 
continued diabetic management. As tube feeding can be 
de-escalated to qhs, insulin regimen should be titrated as well. 
Would suggest close electrolyte monitoring during this 
transition. Ca2+ elevated at 10.7 at the time of discharge, but 
___ resolved by the time of discharge. 
Would also repeat LFTs in ___ weeks as they were mildly 
elevated. 

Time spent: 55 minutes

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent 
hospitalization.  You came to the hospital with a dislodged 
gastric tube.  This was put back in place, and your tube feeds 
were restarted.  You are now being discharged. Your insulin 
regimen was adjusted due to persistently elevated blood sugars 
in the hospital. As you begin to eat more orally, your tube 
feeding regimen can be scaled back to night time only as it had 
been before, and we anticipate your insulin dose will also be 
able to decrease. Since you aren't eating much as of now, we 
recommend keeping your insulin doses higher for now. 

It is important that you continue to take your medications as 
prescribed and follow up with the medical team at your facility 
for further care.

We wish you the best. 

Sincerely, 
Your care team at ___ 

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for G-tube replacement. She has a complicated past medical history, including a stroke with residual deficits, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and a total colectomy with ileostomy. She was recently readmitted from another hospital for a small bowel obstruction and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, left ostomy, and reduction of internal hernia, but unfortunately, the abdominal graft failed.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient complained of abdominal pain around her ileostomy site and PEG tube site, as well as burning with urination. She was found to have hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic acidosis, with concern for intraabdominal infection. She was started on insulin and antibiotics, and a CT abdomen showed nonspecific areas of low attenuation in the liver, which may be due to hepatic infarction or geographic fat.

The patient underwent several procedures, including G-tube placement and replacement, and was prescribed several medications, including insulin, antibiotics, and pain medication. She was also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was treated with antibiotics.

The patient's physical exam revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness around the PEG tube site and ileostomy site, as well as a left thigh skin wound. Her neurological exam showed residual deficits from her stroke, including right-sided hemiplegia. ||endoftext||"

Pertinent Results:
ARTERIOGRAMS: 
  
FINDINGS:  
Right common carotid artery:  Was well visualized and was of 
mild tortuosity.  The anterior intracranial circulation is well 
visualized.  The distal internal carotid arteries well 
visualized the peak stress, lacerum, cavernous, clinoid, 
ophthalmic, and communicating segments do not show any 
abnormalities.  A infundibulum is associated with a small 
posterior communicating artery.  The middle cerebral artery is 
well visualized as is bifurcation.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
are identified.  The anterior cerebral artery is well 
visualized.  The anterior communicating artery is also well 
visualized and appears to have 2 infundibuli, from which 2 small 
vessels can be seen emerging, this is best appreciated on the 
three-dimensional reconstructions.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
were detected.  An early draining veins or intracranial to 
extracranial shunting can be identified. 
  
Left common carotid artery:  Was well visualized was of small 
tortuosity.  The anterior intracranial circulation well 
visualized.  The distal internal carotid artery was well 
visualized, the peak stress, lacerum, cavernous, clinoid, 
ophthalmic, and communicating segments did not show any 
abnormalities.  E termination is normal.  The middle cerebral 
artery is well visualized as is bifurcation and does not show 
any aneurysmal abnormalities.  The anterior cerebral artery is 
well visualized not show any abnormalities.  The anterior 
communicating artery is again noted.  And again the infundibula 
are noted with the small vessels imaging from the tip.  Again 
this is best appreciated on the three-dimensional rotational 
angiography reconstructions.  No aneurysmal abnormalities are 
detected.  Note early draining veins or intracranial to 
extracranial shunting identified. 
  
  
Left vertebral artery:  Is well visualized and is of small 
tortuosity.  
Bilaterally the posterior cerebral arteries, superior cerebellar 
arteries and anterior inferior cerebellar arteries are well 
visualized bilaterally and did not reveal any aneurysmal 
abnormalities.  The posterior inferior cerebellar arteries 
bilaterally can also be identified not show any abnormalities.  
The basilar artery itself does not show any irregularities are 
abnormalities within normal AP X.  The distal portion of the 
right vertebral artery can be seen second route of reflux and 
does not show any abnormalities.  No early draining veins or 
intracranial to extracranial shunting was identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Normal diagnostic cerebral angiogram 

RECOMMENDATION(S): 
1. No further cerebral angiograms required 

___ PELVIS XRAY
IMPRESSION:  
No acute fracture, although the coccyx is not evaluated on this 
examination.  Dedicated sacrum/coccyx radiographs can be 
performed if clinically indicated. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from ___ on the evening of 
___ after a ___ revealed small amounts of SAH in the sylvian 
fissure without hydrocephalus and ACA aneurysm. The patient was 
transferred for further neurosurgical intervention. On arrival 
the patient remained intact and was awaiting cerebral angiogram 
with possible intervention. 

On ___, the patient underwent a diagnostic angiogram that was 
negative for aneurysm, therefore it was deemed that her SAH was 
likely traumatic. The team liberalized the frequency of the 
patient's neurological checks. She was kept on nimodipine for 
now per ___. The patient was intact on post-angio check. 

On ___, the patient was transferred out of the ICU, and her 
nimodipine was stopped. Urine electrolytes were sent for 
investigation of large urine output. They were within normal 
limits.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable, with a 
serum sodium of 141.  Disposition planning was initiated. 

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable. OT was 
consulted for cognitive and home safety evaluation. Physical 
therapy saw the patient, and deemed that she required ___ more 
visits inpatient prior to going home. 

On ___, the patient underwent a tertiary survey with ACS, as 
her admitting chief complaint was a fall. This was without 
further recommendations of diagnostics. The patient was again 
evaluated by both occupational and physical therapy, and both 
services recommended continued outpatient follow-up.  The 
patient was otherwise deemed stable and ready for discharge with 
appropriate follow-up.

nonmobile atheroma in the aortic arch. Given risk for subsequent 
emboli, discussion was held with the patient, wife, and Dr. 
___ the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation 
vs dual antiplatelet therapy.  The patient chose dual 
antiplatelet therapy and was started on plavix and baby aspirin. 
 His stroke risk factors included hypertension, hyperlipidemia 
(although LDL- 54 well controlled on Crestor), diabetes (A1c 
9.3%).  His home rosuvasation and lantus were continued.  Given 
his recent visual field cut and our imprecise VF impatient 
testing, we advised Mr ___ not to drive until formal VF 
testing is done and there is confirmation that he can respond to 
all parts of his VFs to drive safetly.  A letter to his employer 
was generated, explaining this restriction. 

# ___: 
He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and was 
continued on his home meds: amlodipine, lasix, metoprolol, 
trandolapril, crestor. For his complex atheroma in the aortic 
arch, he was started on asa81 and plavix.

# ENDOCRINE:  
Poorly controlled diabetes, A1c 9.3%. He continued his lantus 
and glipizide.  We discussed the ___ of diet and 
exercise.

====================

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1) Needs formal VF testing prior to returning to driving.
2) Started on plavix & asa 81, but may need to consider systemic 
anticoagulation if further embolic phenomenon
3) Would benefit from ___ visits again in the future. 
4) PACT team is following

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to 
___.  You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left visual 
field cut resulting from a transient ischemic attack (a mini 
stroke), a condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen 
and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is 
the part of your body that controls and directs all the other 
parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived 
of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
1) high cholesterol including cholesterol in your aorta (large 
vessel leaving your heart
2) high blood pressure
3) diabetes mellitus

We are changing your medications as follows:
1) START Plavix 75mg daily
2) DECREASE your Aspirin dose to only 81mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Because of your visual problems last week, it is important for 
you to have a complete visual field test at your 
ophthalmologists office.  You CANNOT drive until you have this 
test completed and the results are approved by your 
ophthalmologist. 

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted for evaluation of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and a right eye plaque. He has a history of syncope, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, diabetic retinopathy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, gout, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He has no history of neurologic conditions in his family. 

The patient's physical examination was normal, with no focal neurological deficits. His laboratory results showed elevated blood glucose and urea nitrogen levels, as well as mild right ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram. 

The patient's MRI brain was negative for stroke, and his MRA neck showed no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion. He was diagnosed with a TIA and was started on dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of subsequent emboli. ||endoftext||"
