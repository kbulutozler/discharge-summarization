carotid endarterectomy, which went well without complication 
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the 
floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and oxycodone 
for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received oxycodone and tylenol with good 
effect and adequate pain control.  

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. An artertial 
line was initially placed for close blood pressure monitoring. 
He was continued on all home medications including beta-blocker. 
Home ace-inhibitor was restarted POD1.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Foley catheter 
was removed at midnight POD0 and the patient voided. Following 
foley catheter placement, hematuria was noted. It cleared over 
the postoperative course. Urology recommended the patient be 
seen by his outpatient urologist given his history of bladder 
cancer. This was commnunicated to the patient and his wife and 
daughter directly.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection.   

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required. INR was checked POD1 
after coumadin was held POD0. It was restarted on his home 
dosing regimen POD1. Communication with his PCP who manages his 
coumadin as an outpatient was made prior to discharge and 
followup INR check and coumadin dosing was established. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and

outpatient basis.

On ___, the patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of the 
right temporal brain mass, which went well without complication. 
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient 
underwent a postoperative CT scan, which revealed no active 
bleeding. Afterwards, the patient was transferred to the floor 
where she remained stable overnight into ___. On ___ she 
udnerwent a WAND study in anticipation of going to the OR on 
___ for resection. 

On ___ she went to the operating room for a right temporal 
craniectomy for resection of intracranial lesion. She toelrated 
the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room, and 
transferred to the ICU post-operatively for observation and 
care. Post op CT scan showed no signs of bleed.  In the evening 
the patient had afib with RVR with HRs up to the 140s.  The 
patient was converted back to NSR overnight after going on a 
dilt drip. 

On ___ the patient continued to progress well in the ICU.  A

low ___. Normal saline boluses were given without much change. 
5% albumin was then given with gradual increase in urine output 
and SBP to low 100s. He received a 2nd dose of ATG. Prograf was 
held as this was suspected of decreasing urine output. Incision 
was intact with scant serosanguinous drainage. Abdomen was 
non-distended. He experienced a little bit of nausea and was 
given Zofran. Urine output gradually increased to 150ml/hr. He

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with complicated past medical history 
including CVA s/p hemicraniectomy, TAC with end ileostomy 
(History of crohns), recent admission to ___ on ___ with 
SBO for which she underwent exlap, LOA, reduction of internal 
hernia c/b abdominal wall soft tissue necrosis/infection 
followed failed abdominal graft (___) who presented from 
___ rehab for G-tube replacement, found to have 
hyperglycemia, ___, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic 
acidosis. She was admitted to the FICU for closer monitoring 
with improvement in her AGMA, resulting in transfer to medicine 
service. Ultimately the end of her hospitalization involved 
adjustments of her insulin and tube feeding regimen in order to 
obtain adequate glycemic control. 

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis
# Respiratory acidosis
# Lactic acidosis
Patient presented with elevated lactate and AGMA. The suspect 
etiology was hypovolemia with improvement in lactate after 4L 
IVF. There was brief increase in lactate to 5 while in ICU but 
this was felt to be a spurious value with improvement after 1L 
of IVF. No evidence of ketones in urine to suggest DKA despite 
elevated glucose on presentation. Patient remained normotensive 
in FICU with improvement in AGMA and downtrend in lactate. Given 
stability, she was transferred to medicine service.  She 
remained stable during her stay. Anion gap closed. 

# G-tube
# Nutrition
G-tube dislodged at outside facility. Surrounding erythema and 
tenderness. Plastic surgery and wound consult evaluated the site 
and were not concerned by its appearance. ___ was consulted for 
G-tube replacement and the existing tube was put back in place.  
Her tube feeds were restarted and advanced to goal.  She was 
able to tolerate a full regular diet before discharge, but not 
quite at goal in terms of nutrition. As such her tube feeds are 
currently running continuous, and as a result her insulin 
regimen, outlined below, needed titration. Initially she was 
also placed on a pureed solid/thin liquid diet however this was 
advanced to soft solids/thin liquids before discharge. Once able 
to take sufficient PO intake, her tube feeds may be changed to 
Glucerna 1.2 @ 60 mL/hr x12hours w/ Juven TID ___ kcal, 50 g 
protein, 1590 mL free water), with monitoring of sodium and 
hydration status; adjust flushes prn. Her insulin will also need 
titration as her tube feeds are adjusted. 

# Concern for aspiration
Several days ago was found to have food in her mouth. SLP 
recommending pureed solids with thin liquids, Meds crushed in 
applesauce via tube, 1:1 feeds. Patient very unhappy with this 
change, SLP re-evaluated and recommended soft solids with thin 
liquids. Hopefully this will help with augmentation of her PO 
intake. 

# Diabetes with hyperglycemia
Glucose in the 500s on presentation. Started on insulin drip in 
ED, transitioned to SC. No ketones on UA, Beta-OH wnl.  She was 
given her home glargine and sliding scale insulin, but had blood 
sugar 300s.  ___ was consulted and increased her home Lantus 
and Humalog. Ultimately, likely due to continuous tube feeding 
rather than cycled, her insulin requirements went up 
significantly. At the time of discharge she is requiring the 
following: 
-lantus 70 units BID
-Humalog q4hrs with scale: 
71-100: 0 units
101-150: 12 units
151-200: 17 units
201-250: 22 units
251-300: 27 units
301-350: 32 units
351-400: 37 units
>400: 42 units
Her sugars have been running in the high 200-low 300s by the 
time of discharge (significantly improved). Anticipate that as 
her PO feeds pick up and tube feeds become night time 
only/cycled, she could go back to her home insulin regimen 
(lantus 50 units BID, Humalog 16 units TIDWM). For now, she will 
need q4hrs Humalog until continuous tube feeds are 
stopped/tapered off.  

# Pyuria
# Urinary tract infection: Endorsed dysuria on admission.  UA 
was positive, but urine culture was negative.  Empiric 
ceftriaxone was started and stopped.

# Abdominal wound
# Abdominal pain
Patient presented with abdominal pain. Exam notable for 
significant erythema surrounding ileostomy site and abdominal 
wound. CT scan without evidence for abdominal pain. At this 
point, suspect that her abdominal pain is related to the skin 
erythema.  Plastic surgery and wound care were consulted and 
provided recommendations for wound care. 

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis recently. Possibly related to hepatic 
infarction (infarction vs geographic fat on CT), but ultrasound 
shows main and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal 
flow. Hepatitis B and C serologies were sent and were negative. 
Plan was to continue to trend LFTs. 

# Acute kidney injury: Likely pre-renal. Improved with IV 
fluids.

# Hypercalcemia: Suspect related to dehydration and immobility. 
Improved with IV fluids. Ca2+ 10.7 on the day of discharge, will 
need monitoring periodically with tube feeding. 

# Hypertension: amlodipine and metoprolol were initially held 
while she was critically ill and as she remained normotensive 
these were not resumed. If/when BP starts to trend up, would 
resume these. HR around the ___, so could consider Metoprolol 
first, but might consider starting at lower doses than she had 
been on before. 

# h/o CVA w/ residual asphasia and right hemiplegia: patient was 
continued on her home baclofen, gabapentin, and lidocaine patch

# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: patient was given 
duonebs and albuterol prn

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin

# Depression: continued amitriptyline

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis recently. Possibly related to hepatic 
infarction (infarction vs geographic fat on CT), but ultrasound 
shows main and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal 
flow.
- hepatitis serologies negative
- abdominal exam benign 
- outpatient follow up 
- LFTs trended down slightly before discharge, will need repeats 
in ___ weeks to ensure stable/trending down 

TRANSITIONS OF CARE
-------------------
# Follow-up: patient will return to rehab and will need 
continued diabetic management. As tube feeding can be 
de-escalated to qhs, insulin regimen should be titrated as well. 
Would suggest close electrolyte monitoring during this 
transition. Ca2+ elevated at 10.7 at the time of discharge, but 
___ resolved by the time of discharge. 
Would also repeat LFTs in ___ weeks as they were mildly 
elevated. 

Time spent: 55 minutes

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent 
hospitalization.  You came to the hospital with a dislodged 
gastric tube.  This was put back in place, and your tube feeds 
were restarted.  You are now being discharged. Your insulin 
regimen was adjusted due to persistently elevated blood sugars 
in the hospital. As you begin to eat more orally, your tube 
feeding regimen can be scaled back to night time only as it had 
been before, and we anticipate your insulin dose will also be 
able to decrease. Since you aren't eating much as of now, we 
recommend keeping your insulin doses higher for now. 

It is important that you continue to take your medications as 
prescribed and follow up with the medical team at your facility 
for further care.

We wish you the best. 

Sincerely, 
Your care team at ___ 

 
Followup Instructions:

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for G-tube replacement. She has a complicated past medical history, including a stroke with residual deficits, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and a total colectomy with ileostomy. She was recently readmitted from another hospital for a small bowel obstruction and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, left ostomy, and reduction of internal hernia, but unfortunately, the abdominal graft failed.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient complained of abdominal pain around her ileostomy site and PEG tube site, as well as burning with urination. She was found to have hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic acidosis, with concern for intraabdominal infection. She was started on insulin and antibiotics, and a CT abdomen showed nonspecific areas of low attenuation in the liver, which may be due to hepatic infarction or geographic fat.

The patient underwent several procedures, including G-tube placement and replacement, and was prescribed several medications, including insulin, antibiotics, and pain medication. She was also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was treated with antibiotics.

The patient's physical exam revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness around the PEG tube site and ileostomy site, as well as a left thigh skin wound. Her neurological exam showed residual deficits from her stroke, including right-sided hemiplegia. ||endoftext||"

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs. ___ you were admitted on ___ and underwent an 
uncomplicated left sided below the knee amputation. However, 
given the nature of the procedure, you will be discharged to 
rehab and will rehabilitate. 

Here are your discharge instructions:

ACTIVITY:
 On the side of your amputation you are non-weight bearing on 
left side for ___ weeks
 You should keep this amputation site elevated whenever 
possible

 No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks
 
BATHING/SHOWERING:
 You may shower when you get home
 No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from 
your date of surgery
 
WOUND CARE:
 Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If 
they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for 
staple removal.
 When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place 
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will 
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these 
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm 
water and soap in the shower.
 
CAUTIONS:

She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES
-- NEW: senna PRN and Colace PRN constipation
-- HELD: loperamide (as noted above, consider low dose trial if 
she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools. 
[ ] Continue to discuss goals of care with patient  
[ ] Patient will follow up with the interventional 
pulmonologists for further monitoring of her tracheostomy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team 
 
Followup Instructions:

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has allergies to penicillins and oxybutynin. The patient's chief complaint was hypoxia, dyspnea, productive cough, and congestion, which she experienced for the past two days. She was previously intubated and had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was referred to the emergency department for stoma closure and was found to have tachypnea, rhonchorous lungs, and a stoma site. The patient was given various medications, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and cefepime. She was also given oxygen therapy and had a flutter valve inserted. The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, and normal abdominal examination. The patient's laboratory results showed anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Imaging studies revealed extensive atelectasis in the lower lungs, which could not exclude a superimposed pneumonia. The patient was discharged with a tracheostomy mask and speaking valve, and was advised to use a flutter valve and oxygen therapy. ||endoftext||"

Pertinent Results:
ARTERIOGRAMS: 
  
FINDINGS:  
Right common carotid artery:  Was well visualized and was of 
mild tortuosity.  The anterior intracranial circulation is well 
visualized.  The distal internal carotid arteries well 
visualized the peak stress, lacerum, cavernous, clinoid, 
ophthalmic, and communicating segments do not show any 
abnormalities.  A infundibulum is associated with a small 
posterior communicating artery.  The middle cerebral artery is 
well visualized as is bifurcation.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
are identified.  The anterior cerebral artery is well 
visualized.  The anterior communicating artery is also well 
visualized and appears to have 2 infundibuli, from which 2 small 
vessels can be seen emerging, this is best appreciated on the 
three-dimensional reconstructions.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
were detected.  An early draining veins or intracranial to 
extracranial shunting can be identified. 
  
Left common carotid artery:  Was well visualized was of small 
tortuosity.  The anterior intracranial circulation well 
visualized.  The distal internal carotid artery was well 
visualized, the peak stress, lacerum, cavernous, clinoid, 
ophthalmic, and communicating segments did not show any 
abnormalities.  E termination is normal.  The middle cerebral 
artery is well visualized as is bifurcation and does not show 
any aneurysmal abnormalities.  The anterior cerebral artery is 
well visualized not show any abnormalities.  The anterior 
communicating artery is again noted.  And again the infundibula 
are noted with the small vessels imaging from the tip.  Again 
this is best appreciated on the three-dimensional rotational 
angiography reconstructions.  No aneurysmal abnormalities are 
detected.  Note early draining veins or intracranial to 
extracranial shunting identified. 
  
  
Left vertebral artery:  Is well visualized and is of small 
tortuosity.  
Bilaterally the posterior cerebral arteries, superior cerebellar 
arteries and anterior inferior cerebellar arteries are well 
visualized bilaterally and did not reveal any aneurysmal 
abnormalities.  The posterior inferior cerebellar arteries 
bilaterally can also be identified not show any abnormalities.  
The basilar artery itself does not show any irregularities are 
abnormalities within normal AP X.  The distal portion of the 
right vertebral artery can be seen second route of reflux and 
does not show any abnormalities.  No early draining veins or 
intracranial to extracranial shunting was identified.

patient's neurological checks. She was kept on nimodipine for 
now per ___. The patient was intact on post-angio check. 

On ___, the patient was transferred out of the ICU, and her 
nimodipine was stopped. Urine electrolytes were sent for 
investigation of large urine output. They were within normal 
limits.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable, with a 
serum sodium of 141.  Disposition planning was initiated. 

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable. OT was 
consulted for cognitive and home safety evaluation. Physical 
therapy saw the patient, and deemed that she required ___ more 
visits inpatient prior to going home. 

On ___, the patient underwent a tertiary survey with ACS, as 
her admitting chief complaint was a fall. This was without 
further recommendations of diagnostics. The patient was again 
evaluated by both occupational and physical therapy, and both 
services recommended continued outpatient follow-up.  The 
patient was otherwise deemed stable and ready for discharge with

IMAGING
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is bilateral diffuse 
reticulonodular opacity in the lower lung fields and 
ground-glass haziness. These findings are compatible with 
pulmonary edema. Dialysis catheter is in unchanged position with 
tip seen in the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. Cluster of 
calcifications in the right mid lung are unchanged. The aorta is 
tortuous and calcified. There is mild cardiomegaly. No definite 
pleural effusions are seen.
.
___ TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
inferior akinesis and near akinesis of the distal half of the 
septum and anterior walls. The apex is aneurysmal and akinetic. 
The remaining segments contract well (LVEF 30%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image 
quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w 
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased 
and global left ventricular systolic function is improved with 
slight decrease in cavity size. Regional left ventricular 
dysfunction is similar.
.
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison with the study of 
___, there has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary 
vascular congestion with the pulmonary vessels now only mildly 
engorged. Minimal atelectatic change is seen at the left base 
and there may be blunting of the costophrenic angle. 
Hemodialysis catheter remains in place.

LAD, scleroderma, HTN, ESRD on HD s/p transplant x2, and 
systolic HF (EF ___ who comes in with chronic burning chest 
pain and acute systolic heart failure.
.  
# Acute Systolic CHF: Patient presented with increased dyspnea 
and chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema. Physical exam 
demonstrated rales to mid lung fields. Patient reports increased 
dyspnea prior to dialysis recently and may need change to dry 
weight. She had a session of ultrafiltration the night of 
admission and then a truncated 2-hour session of dialysis the 
following day. In keeping with her outpatient schedule, the pt 
went for a full session of dialysis on ___. ECHO showed an 
EF of 30% and so she was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg 
qHS, with lisinopril 2.5mg to possibly be started as an 
outpatient (and to be titrated up as her blood pressure will 
tolerate it and also to be held on her dialysis days). After her 
dialysis session, pt's symptoms improved, physical exam 
demonstrated clear lung fields, and chest xray showed interval 
improvement in pulmonary edema. 
.
#. Chest Pain/Burning: Pts pain was atypical. Her symptom has 
bothered her each evening for a very long time, and is 
exacerbated when she lies on her back. It is thought to be GI 
related per outpatient providers and will follow up with GI in 
one week. EKG was without changes, and discomfort resolved on 
arrival and with subsequent nitroglycerin. Her cardiac enzymes 
were trended until they peaked. She was put on PPI and carafate, 
which seemed to provide relief of her pain. 
. 
#. ESRD sp transplant on HD: Pt had a session of ultrafiltration 
on the night of admission and was continued on her outpatient 
schedule of dialysis, ___. Her graft is 
well-functioning and her tunneled catheter was pulled. She was 
continued on her home prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus, and 
calcitriol. Her tacrolimus levels were within target. The amount 
of fluid they were able to take off and the length of time spent 
on dialysis was limited by pt's low blood pressure. She will 
continue to have 4 hours of dialysis, three times a week, with 
the next session on ___ and an estimated dry weight of 
67.5kg. 
.   
# CAD: Pt was continued on her home statin and ASA. 
.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was in sinus rhythm, and had no active issues with 
her rhythm during the admission. She was monitored on telemetry
.
#. Normocytic Anemia: At recent baseline. Secondary to ESRD. She 
was continued on Aranesp with dialysis per her outpatient 
regimen and given 1 unit pRBC with an appropriate increase in 
her hematocrit.
.   
# HTN: Blood pressure was well controlled on presentation. She 
was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg qHS, with lisinopril to 
possibly be started as an outpatient as long as her blood 
pressure can tolerate it. Her lisinopril should be held on 
hemodialysis days due to low blood pressures.
.  
# HLD: Pt was continued on her home Lipitor.    
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Recommend initiating lisinopril 2.5mg daily as an outpatient 
as long as her blood pressures can tolerate it. This medication 
should be held on hemodialysis days.

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 57-year-old female who was admitted with burning chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a history of coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction and stenting, as well as scleroderma, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She was previously a renal transplant recipient, but her current transplant is failing. She was admitted to the hospital with pulmonary edema and dyspnea, and was intubated for respiratory distress. She was started on dialysis and was treated with lasix, which provided relief from her symptoms. She was also prescribed furosemide and omeprazole.

The patient's diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the report, but it appears that she has chronic kidney disease, pulmonary edema, and possibly gastrointestinal issues contributing to her chest pain. She underwent a removal of a tunneled dialysis catheter and was started on CPAP in the emergency department.

At discharge, the patient's medications included furosemide, omeprazole, and possibly other medications not specified in the report. Her physical exam was notable for mild respiratory distress, but she was otherwise stable and comfortable while sitting upright with oxygen. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old right handed ___ driver with an unknown medical 
history was found in his truck confused by the police on the 
morning of admission. According to the patient, he has nausea 
last night, which continued until this morning. He also had a 
bifrontal throbbing headache, which continues to be present. He 
is not sure whether the headache came on suddenly. He does not 
know why he was found in his truck with a laceration above his 
right eye, and a dislocated right middle finger.  It was 
hypothesized he may have had a seizure resulting in mild trauma 
and possible contra-coup injury (right frontal trauma with left 
posterior temporal contusion).  Other possibilities included 
arteriovenous malformation or underlying mass.  The patient was 
admitted to the neurology ICU for further management.
.
Hospital Course by problem;
.
Neuro; The patient was loaded on keppra upon admission and 
continued at 1000 mg bid.  He was monitored initially with q1h 
neurochecks.  His systolic blood pressure was maintained between 
100-140 without intervention.  A repeat CT head showed a stable 
intraparenchymal and small subdural hematoma.  MRI brain showed 
no evidence of underlying mass.  A CTA showed no sign of 
vascular malformation.  The patient will undergo repeat MRI 
brain with and without contrast in ___ weeks for further 
evaluation of his hemorrhage.  He will continue on keppra at 
1000 mg bid for at least six months.  The patient was 
transferred to the neurology floor on HD#2.  There he was 
evaluated by ___ who found that he was stable and able to 
ambulate without assistance. A repeat head CT on ___ showed no 
change in the intraparenchymal or subdural bleeds. He did not 
have any seizure activity while in house.
.
MSK; The patient was found to have a dislocation of his right 
middle finger which was subsequently reduced. This was splinted 
and did not cause him significant pain
.
CV/Pulm/Renal/GI: the patient was stable from a cardiac, 
pulmonary, renal and GI standpoint. He tolerated a regular diet 
without issues, he made adequate urine and did not have any 
desaturations.

On HD 5 the patient felt well and a repeat head CT showed no 
evolving process. He was anxious to return home to ___ 
as his family had finally arrived in ___. He will take all 
hospital documents with him and tranfer his care down to PA near 
his family. At the time of discharge he was ambulating without 
assistance, tolerating a regular diet but did have some 
persistent confusion. However, he and his family understood the 
gravity of his problem and certified that he would arrange 
follow up care with neurology and neurosurgery upon his return 
to ___.
