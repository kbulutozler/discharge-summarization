Blood Cultures routine and mycolytic NGTD at time of D/C

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended ensure supplementation, 
but pt. did not like ensure and made this clear to nutrition, 
ensure was seen unopened on pt.s tray every morning.
.
#Diarrhea: Likely ___ OI, differential is quite wide: crypto, 
giardia, ___, CMV, C. diff. All previous wkup 
was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is an ___ lady, speaking only ___, with 
___ gastric cancer (diagnosed ___, currently on ramucirumab 
alone (held following surgery) and arthritis, who presented with 
a hip fracture after a fall from standing height.  

===ACUTE ISSUES=== 
#Hip fracture:  
#s/p Fall:  
Presented after a fall from standing height and found to have a 
right intertrochanteric hip fracture with varus angulation. CT 
head with subgaleal hematoma but no intracranial hemorrhage, and 
CT C spine negative for traumatic injury. Fall appears to be 
purely mechanical secondary to underlying neuropathy and 
progressive weakness with possible acute decompensation in the 
setting of pneumonia. She had no LOC, but may have an 
orthostatic component as well contributing to lightheadedness 
given poor PO intake. Troponins obtained for pre-op workup were 
slightly elevated x3 (max 0.03). Likely ___ slight ___, EKGs w/o 
e/o MI. 

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service with 
a right hip fracture. The patient was taken to the operating 
room on ___ for right hip ORIF, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given ___ antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient worked with ___ who 
determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
weight-bearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity, and 
will be discharged on ___ for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough discussion was 
had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or 
return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The 
patient was also given written instructions concerning 
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care. 
The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

 
#LLL pneumonia: CXR obtained on pre-op workup showed LLL 
opacity. Unclear if she had a true clinical pneumonia given she 
so did not have symptoms of pneumonia, but fall could be due to 
weakness in the setting of infection. Did not meet criteria for 
HAP. Treated with five day course of ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin. 
 
===CHRONIC ISSUES===
#Gastric cancer: 
Diagnosed ___. Treated with 5 cycles on folfox, followed by 
taxol/ramucirumab for 5 cycles (C5 D1 and ___. Seen by 
oncologist Dr. ___ on ___ who recommended stopping 
taxol and proceeding with ramucirumab alone due to concerns that 
the taxol was causing worsening neuropathy and interfering with 
her quality of life. Of note, ramucirumab was held following her 
operation. Will need outpatient evaluation and discussion of 
goals of care to determine further treatment course. In 
addition, patient had therapeutic paracentesis while inpatient 
on ___.

#GERD: Continued home omeprazole BID.  
#Hypertension: Held spironolactone given elevated creatinine at 
___ initially, restarted on ___.

The patient is a ___ year old gentleman with a history of AVR and 
aortic aneurysm repair, L CFA-axillary bypass graft ___ and R 
femoral to axillary bypass PFTE graft ___ admitted with right 
groin wound dehiscence and S. anginosus and MSSA bacteremia with 
course c/b rupture of a mycotic aneurysm at his femoral graft 
site. 

VASCULAR: Right groin wound was packed, and patient was started 
on vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl and admitted to the vascular 
surgery service. Admission blood cultures grew strep anginosus 
and wound swab was polymicrobial including MSSA and e Coli. CT 
angiogram was concerning for infection at the site of bypass 
graft anastamosis with the femoral artery. ID was consulted, who 
recommended transition to Zosyn. Pt was then pre-oped and 
consented for surgery for infected right femoral axillary 
bypass. Coumadin was stopped in preperation of surgery. He was 
on a heparin drip for his mechanical valve. 

CTA: 
  
1. Widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with 
minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the 
bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site. Although, 
no drainable 
fluid collections or abscesses are seen, this would be 
concerning for 
infection in the presence of clinical symptoms. 
  
2. Stable appearance of the ascending thoracic aortic graft and 
widely patent 
left axillary to femoral bypass graft. Normal appearance of the 
abdominal 
aorta and its major visceral branches. 
  
3. Unchanged appearance of an isodense right lower pole renal 
lesion and 
multiple indeterminate left renal lesions since the earlier 
study. These can 
be further evaluated by renal CTA protocol if this has not 
evaluated before. 

He was taken to the OR after developing several small bleeds 
from his operative site concerning for herald bleeds from a 
ruptured aneurysm. In the OR on ___ he was found to have fresh 
clotted blood at his femoral graft site with concern for a 
disrupted femoral anastomosis. He was found to have inflammatory 
changes in his retroperitoneum and a large inflammatory phlegmon 
at his rectus. The distal portion of his axillofemoral graft was 
detached and a saphenous vein graft was placed. 

___ - Exploration of right groin, control of the external iliac 
artery via a retroperitoneal exposure, excision of distal 
portion of the axillary-femoral bypass,
and vein patch repair of the femoral artery with saphenous vein 
patch.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

Due to his massive bleeding and transfusion requirements, he 
developed abdominal compartment syndrome overnight and was taken 
back to the OR on ___ for exploration of retroperitoneal space, 
washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, 
packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the 
abdominal incision which was left open. 

___ - Exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of 
retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the 
retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision 
which was left open.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

___ - Abdominal packing removal, Abdominal washout, Temporary 
abdominal closure.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

___ - Abdominal closure with mesh.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR. 

On ___ patient had decreased urine output in setting of 
increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, 
which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and 
muscle paralysis. Neo was weaned. Sedation was transitioned to 
Precedex and vent was changed to PSV, with improvement in 
alertnent. 

Patient was noted to have elevated LFTs; RUQ ultrasound showed 
no abnormalities and LFTs trended downward. Systolic blood 
pressure rose to 200s with agitation, which responded to 
Fentanyl and hydralazine. 

On ___ patient was extubated. Patient passed bedside swallow 
eval and was transition to oral nutrition. 

On ___ patient was transferred from the CVICU to the VICU.

In the VICU to floor non incidental, The rest of the Hospital 
course will by systems:

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient narcotics IV with good 
effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, 
the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. 

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored. Pt also has Mechanical 
Valve was on IV heparin with transition tocoumadin on DC

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen 
to encourage bowel movement. Pt did have trouble with nutrion, 
started on dronabinol  2.5 mg PO BID. Pt also had loose stools - 
neg C Diff x 3, d/c'ed IV flagyl per ID

GU: Foley was removed when apprpriate. Intake and output were 
closely monitored. Pt did have acute on chronic renal failure. 
On ___ patient had decreased urine output in setting of 
increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, 
which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and 
muscle paralysis

ID: ID consult, Was originally on IV vanco . PO cipro / PO 
flagyl. ID transitioned to IV Zosyn - to be on a total of 6 
weeks, then PO supression therapy for life. Name of ___ 
to be determined. The patient's temperature was closely watched 
for signs of infection. 

He waa dmitted on ___ with a wound dehiscence and fever. ___ 
blood cultures drawn ___ grew S. anginosus as well as MSSA on 
___ and ___. A wound swab of the right groin site has grown 
MSSA as well as mixed flora. A CT Torso on ___ showed ""a widely 
patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic 
site."" A TEE was performed showed ""a well-seated bi-leaflet 
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with normal leaflet motion 
and gradients. No discrete vegetations."" 

The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam for 
coverage of S. anginosus and MSSA BSI as well as a polymicrobial 
wound infection. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. 

On day of discharge, pt's BUN/creat =65/2.6, thought to be 
likely due to dehydration. IVF bolus was given with maintenance 
IVF to continue at rehab until creatinine trends down. PO fluids 
also encouraged. Lasix was discontinued and ___ should not be 
restarted until creatinine at baseline. VAC was also 
discontinued and  should continue on wet to dry BID until follow 
up. Foley was reinserted for urinary retention of approx 600 cc 
urine. Please attempt voiding trial in a day or so.

cover it when outside. 
Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, 
or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment.
You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your 
activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. 
___ try to do too much all at once.
No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 
No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
***Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

What You ___ Experience:
You may experience headaches and incisional pain. 
You may also experience some post-operative swelling around 
your face and eyes. This is normal after surgery and most 
noticeable on the second and third day of surgery.  You apply 
ice or a cool or warm washcloth to your eyes to help with the 
swelling. The swelling will be its worse in the morning after 
laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. 
You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from 
the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be 
easier during this time. 
Feeling more tired or restlessness is also common.
Constipation is common. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and 
eat a high-fiber diet. If you are taking narcotics (prescription

Discharge Instructions:
It has been a privilege to take care of you ___ 
___.
.
You were hospitalized because your heart was beating very slowly 
because of an abnormality in the electrical wiring system of 
your heart; you have a condition known as complete heart block.
.
You underwent an emergency procedure to implant a pacemaker into 
your chest that provides your heart with a regular electrical 
current to ensure that it beats at the correct rhythm. You 
tolerated the procedure well and the pacemaker is functioning 
correctly. This pacemaker will hopefully help to prevent 
recurrence of the fatigue that you have been experiencing.
.
You should avoid raising your arms above your head, and should 
also avoid heavy lifting, for the next several weeks.  Do not 
remove the steri-strips over the site where the pacemaker was 
placed.

Implantation of a pacemaker is surgical procedure, which is why 
you will require antibiotics to prevent infections. The 
following is your antibiotic regimen:
# START: Clindamycin 300 mg every 6h for 1 day
.
Otherwise, your heart regimen is unchanged. Your current heart 
regimen is the following:
# CONTINUE: Torsemide 60 mg twice daily
# CONTINUE: Lisinopril 10 mg daily
# CONTINUE: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual tablet as needed for 
CP
**Take up to 3 tablets 5 minutes apart then call ___ if pain 
does not resolve.**
# CONTINUE: Cholestyramine 4 gram packet daily
# CONTINUE: Ezetimibe 10 mg daily
.
We decreased the dose of your Gabapentin to 300mg daily. This 
dose is based on your kidney function levels.  You can discuss 
the dosing with your primary care doctor next week.

Please continue to take all of your other medications as 
previously prescribed. 
.
Please attend the follow-up appointments detailed below.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo F with a history of triple negative BRCA1+ 
breast cancer diagnosed in ___. She underwent bilateral 
mastectomy and chemotherapy at that time. She has been generally 
lost to follow-up but was hospitalized recently for shortness of 
breath and found to have recurrence of her cancer.  
 Body imaging showed extensive probable metastases in the thorax 
with adenopathy and numerous pulmonary nodules as well as some 
left lung segment collapse. She did not have large pleural or 
pericardial effusions. The abdomen was benign including the 
liver. Bone scan, however, showed numerous abnormalities 
suggesting skeletal metastases. Widespread skeletal involvement 
is somewhat uncommon in triple-negative cancers, but the bone 
scan compared to prior scans does show a marked change. Her 
tumor marker is mildly elevated. She has some hoarseness, which 
likely reflects left recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement given 
the high concentration of disease in her left upper chest.  

 She now comes in because reports that she has had a severe 
headache and nausea for the past 48 hours. She reports that she 
has been waking up with a headaches every morning this week; 
however, this headache has persisted since yesterday and has not 
resolved. She reports she has been feeling nauseous and has not 
been able to each much. Reports that today she ""vomited up 
bile."" She denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope. 
Reports that she has had difficulty seeing out of her L eye and 
""can only see half a word"" when she reads.  

 In the ED, she had a head CT that showed:  
 There are multiple intracranial metastatic lesions. A lesion in 
the right occipital lobe best seen on series 602 B image 31 
measures approximately 3.1 x 3.1 cm and is complicated by a 
small amount of intralesional hemorrhage. There is associated 
vasogenic edema. Additional lesions are seen, for example and 
extra-axial lesion on series 2, image 23 abutting the inner 
table of the frontal bone in a left para falcine location. A 
small hyperdense lesion at the left parietal vertex is seen on 
series 2, image 25. A lesion abutting the  
 frontal lobe is seen on series 2, image 13 measuring 
approximately 1.4 x 3.7 cm. There is no midline shift or 
downward herniation though there is asymmetric effacement of 
right cerebral sulci compared to the left.  
 She was evaluated by neurosurgery who recommended Keppra, 
Dexamethasone, keeping SBP<140, and MRI scan.  
 
 On arrival to the floor, patient is tired, but otherwise well 
appearing.  
 REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 10 point ROS was performed and was 
otherwise negative.  
 
Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY  
She initially presented in early ___ with a multicentric 
high-grade triple-negative left breast cancer. The largest focus 
of invasive cancer was 5 cm. There was no lymphovascular 
invasion and her four sentinel lymph nodes sampled at the time 
of mastectomy in ___ were negative. The contralateral 
prophylactic right mastectomy was negative pathologically.  
 BRCA testing showed a BRCA1 mutation.  
 Thus, she had an advanced left breast cancer which was 
multifocal but no lymph node spread while the right breast was 
negative. Following recovery from her mastectomy and her 
bilateral ___ flap reconstructions, a port was inserted and she 
began dose-dense cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in early ___. She received four doses of dose-dense cyclophosphamide and 
doxorubicin followed by weekly paclitaxel. Dr. ___ was 
consulted, but did not feel that she required post mastectomy 
radiation therapy based on free margins, the absence of 
lymphovascular invasion and the absence of nodal involvement.  
 Following her chemotherapy there was no additional systemic 
therapy given because of her triple-negative status. We did 
strongly encourage her to have a prophylactic bilateral BSO, but 
she opted to defer that following completion of her other 
therapy. In fact, this was never done and she had a long 
interval where she did not ___ for routine followup here.  
 She was recently seen for shortness of breath. Re-staging 
showed recurrent disease.

IMAGING:

ECG on admission: Sinus bradycardia. Tiny inferior Q waves could 
represent recent or prior inferior myocardial infarction. Right 
ventricular conduction delay not meeting full criteria for right 
bundle-branch block. J point elevation in the lateral leads. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the findings are 
similar. 

Cardiac catheterization ___ preliminary: 
COMMENTS:      
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 

demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary 
artery 
disease.  The LMCA was a very short vessel with no 
angiographically 
apparent diseas.  The LAD and LCx were both large caliber 
vessels with 
no angiographically apparent disease.  The RCA had minimal 
luminal 
irregularities. 
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided 
filling 
pressures with an LVEDP of 27 mmHg.  There was no aortic 
stenosis noted 
on pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta. 
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a normal ejection fraction 
with no 
wall motion abnormalities.  There was no mitral regurgitation. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery 
disease. 
2. Normal ventricular function. 
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressure. 
4. No aortic stenosis. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
change.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male who presented to ___ for acute 
chest pain at rest, was transferred for code STEMI with mild ST 
elevations in inferior leads and T wave inversions in 
anterolateral leads, and was found to have positive cardiac 
biomarkers and mild luminal irregularities in the coronaries on 
catheterization.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Chest pain/elevated troponin: Unclear etiology of pain, but 
unlikely to be coronary artery disease given that patient denies 
angina symptoms, only cardiovascular risk factor is remote 
tobacco use, and there is no evidence of coronary artery disease 
on catheterization. It is possible that polycythemia ___ could 
have precipitated thrombosis in a distal branch not noted on 
catheterization.  Vasospasm is also a possibility, but there is 
no report of cocaine abuse.  Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy was 
considered unlikely given normal left ventriculogram, and 
unlikely to be myocarditis given patient does not have symptoms 
of congestive heart failure and URI symptoms only started 2 days 
ago with a normal echocardiogram.  Another possibility could be 
pulmonary embolus as patient did have hypoxia on presentation, 
however patient was not tachycardic, Wells score was 0 and 
D-dimer was normal.  Cardiac biomarkers were trended, showing 
elevations in troponin and CK-MB, which were trending down at 
the time of discharge.  Patient was started on aspirin 325 mg 
daily and metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.  Cardiac MR was 
ordered for outpatient workup to further delineate a cause of 
the patient symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.  He was chest 
pain free at the time of discharge.  Close follow-up was 
arranged with a cardiologist, as well as the patient's PCP.  
  
# Pump function: patient appeared euvolemic on exam, with no 
prior history of heart disease.  Echocardiogram revealed no 
abnormalities in heart function.  
.  
# Heart rhythm: Patient was in normal sinus rhythm with 8 beats 
of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight that was 
asymptomatic.  

# Polycythemia ___: patient is currently getting phlebotomy 
every 2 weeks.  He was arranged for outpatient hematology 
follow-up upon discharge.
  
TRANSITION OF CARE
------------------  
Code status: patient is confirmed full code  

Follow-up: patient will require a cardiac MR upon discharge, and 
is scheduled up for follow-up with cardiology.  His cholesterol 
panel returned after discharge and should be followed up by the 
outpatient cardiologist.   He will require follow-up with his 
outpatient hematologist for his polycythemia ___.  He also has 
scheduled follow-up with his PCP.

head CT was performed the subsequent day, ___, which did not 
demonstrate any change. On ___ he remained intubated on 
propofol gtt in the TICU.  He continued to have q1hour neuro 
checks, but his neuro exam was inconsistent. There was question 
whether he was moving his lower extremities at all. A MRI Head, 
T and L spine was performed at night. Subarachnoid blood was 
seen in the spinal canal, but it was not felt to be impinging on 
the cord.  On ___ he was extubated, and neurology was 
consulted due to concern for lower extremity weakness.  
Recommendations by neurology were to continue dilantin and to 
start manitol to reduce ICP.  On ___, he was found to be A&O 
x1 only and a repeat head CT showed no significant change. On 
___ patient was taken to the OR for IVC and PEG tube 
placement which was performed without complication however 
postoperative the patient developed anisocoria with dilation of 
the right pupil which resolved spontaneously. Another repeat 
head CT was negative. TF were also started on ___ and were 
advanced to goal on ___. Patient was extubated on ___

1. CXR (___)
Lungs are well expanded, with linear opacities at the lung 
bases, most likely representing atelectasis. However, 
curvilinear opacity could also represent scarring. Heart is 
normal in size, 
and there is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement. Soft tissue 
and bony structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSIONS: Atelectasis 
versus scarring at the left lung base. No acute 
abnormalities. 
2. CT Head w/o Contrast (___)
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, mass 
effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major 
vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are normal 
in caliber and configuration. Visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are well aerated. Osseous structures are 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Loss of Consciousness:
Most likely this was due to hypovolemia given pt's history of 
diarrhea, decreased PO intake and orthostatic symptoms. BP was 
also low on admission. Other concern on admission was for 
cardiogenic syncope.  EKG showed ST-T wave changes with T wave 
inversions in V1-V4 which were unchanged from prior ECGs.  
Troponins and CK were cycled and showed a Troponin of 0.08 which 
did not rise and was likely due to her kidney disease.  Pt had 
no signs of congestive heart failure and an echo was done which 
was normal.  She had no clinical signs of PE.  Has a history of 
seizures and migraines; however no seizure activity was 
observed. TIA/CVA is also unlikely with normal neuro exam. Pt 
also had a history of hypothyroidism and TSH was check and was 
>100.  Free T4 was low at 0.28. Pt has been non-compliant with 
meds in the past but stated that she had not missed any of her 
thyroid medication.  Pt's home pharmacy was called and stated 
that the prescription had last been filled in early ___ but 
had not been filled prior to this.  TSH was checked in the past 
___ and ___ and was elevated at this time as well.  Pt also 
had symptoms of hypothyroidism with weight gain, weakness, 
fatigue, headache and dry skin. Pt was also reported to be 
hypoglycemic on presentation and this could have been a 
contributing factor to syncope with poor oral intake. 
.
On admission, pt was due for dialysis and did undergo HD with 
2.3L removed. On arrival to the floor, BP was low at 80/40.  Pt 
required 2.5L of fluid resuscitation to bring BP to 100s.  She 
was asymptomatic during this time without chest pain, 
lightheadedness or dizziness.  Blood and urine cultures were 
sent and negative.  A urine tox was negative.  Orthostatic BPs 
were checked after fluid resuscitation and were normal.  An 
echocardiogram was done which was normal with an EF of 55%.  Pt 
did well clinically during admission and experienced no other 
symptoms of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.  Her 
anti-hypertensive medications were held in light of her low 
blood pressure.  She was given Levothyroxine at 100mcg/day given 
her low levels of T4 (was previously supposed to be taking 
75mcg/day).
.
The patient experienced no further symptoms of syncope during 
admission.  Telemetry showed no arrhythmias and echocardiogram 
was normal.
.
2. Hypoglycemia:
Pt was hypoglycemic on admission with blood sugar reported to be 
45 at ___. Fingersticks were checked throughout admission and 
blood sugars with in the low-normal range of ___.  LFTs 
were checked for possible causes for hypoglycemia and were with 
AST 45 and ALT 27.
.  
3. Diarrhea: 
Pt stated that diarrhea symptoms had been present prior to 
admission and continued through hospital stay.  Stool cultures 
and ova and parasites were negative.  Likely cause was viral 
gastroenteritis vs. narcotic withdrawal.
. 
4. Substance Abuse: 
Pt was on 120mg methadone daily per ___ clinic.  On date 
of admission, she did not receive this and began to experience 
withdrawal symptoms of anxiety and agitation.  She was given 
120mg of Methadone daily for her hx of narcotic abuse and 
withdrawal symptom prevention. She was given Trazadone 50 qhs as 
per home dose.
. 
5. ESRD:
Nephrology was consulted and pt was dialyzed on date of 
admission as well as on ___ as per home schedule (___). She 
was continued on Calcitriol and calcium carbonate. She tolerated 
dialysis well.
.  
6. Hx of Seizure:
Pt experienced no seizures while admitted. She was continued on 
her home done of Keppra.  
. 
7. Depression
Pt was continued on Fluoxetine.
.
8. Hypothyroidism
As described, pt was hypothyroid with a free T4 of 0.28 and 
unclear if she had been taking Levothyroxine as prescribed.  She 
was put on Levothyroxine 100mcg daily and discharged on this 
dose. She was discharged with ___ services to assist with 
medication compliance. 
.  
9. Asthma
Pt had no asthma symptoms.  Advair was continued.
. 
10. Hospital Prophylaxis:
Pt was put on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis and omeprazole.
.
Code: FULL  
.
Discharge:
Pt was discharged with follow-up in ___ clinic on ___.  She was 
given a prescription for Levothyroxine 100mcg daily with ___

 She states that hip pain started 3 days ago, without preceding 
injury or fall. She has had worsening of the pain, worse with 
movement of the hip. She is on HD MWF, last had HD on ___, 
and did not have HD today due to her hip pain. She was admitted 
to ___ from ___ - ___ for ESBL E. Coli bacteremia, 
discharged on zosyn to complete a 14 day course, which she 
completed on ___ of last week (___).  This morning, she 
developed nausea, vomiting, chills, temp of 100.8, and worsening 
of her R hip pain. She states that she had which he thinks his 
heart failure in the past, although thinks that it was 
associated with an episode of pneumonia, so was not sure. Has 
lost significant amount of weight due to loss of appetite over 
the past year.  

 During ED course, had a transient desaturation to 88% on home 
O2 settings with sensation of dyspnea. Nasal cannula has been 
increased, she has improvement in her dyspnea.  
 In the ED, initial VS were:  T98.3, HR 70, BP 133/58, RR 18, O2 
94% Nasal Cannula. She had desatted to 88%, which improved with 
uptitiration of NC.

Patient was initially transferred to the floor. On the floor her 
K was 6.7. She developed peaked T waves on arrival to the floor. 
She received Calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose. Nephrology was 
consulted for emergent dialysis and patient was transferred to 
the ICU for initiation of HD. Patient was hypoxic to 84% on 5L, 
which improved with uptitration of O2 to 6L. 

On arrival to the MICU patient reports that her breathing has 
improved. She can tell that she has extra fluid and thinks that 
is why she is having difficulty with breathing. She is having 
extensive pain at her right hip. The pain is exacerbated with

RADIOLOGY
=========
___ CXR PA LAT
FINDINGS: 
Evaluation is somewhat limited due to lordotic positioning and 
patient
rotation.  Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta 
is diffusely
calcified and mildly tortuous.  Lung volumes are low which 
accentuates the
width of the superior mediastinal contour.  Increased 
interstitial opacities
are noted diffusely which suggests a chronic interstitial 
abnormality, though
mild interstitial pulmonary edema is not excluded.  No focal 
consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The osseous 
structures are
diffusely demineralized. Irregularity of the left second and 
third lateral
ribs may reflect fractures.   Height loss of 2 vertebral bodies 
at the
thoracolumbar junction are of indeterminate age.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to positioning and patient rotation.
2. Diffuse interstitial opacities could suggest a chronic 
interstitial lung
disease with mild interstitial pulmonary edema not excluded.
3. Irregularity of the left second and third lateral ribs 
suggestive of
fractures.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion clearly seen.
4. Compression deformities of 2 adjacent vertebral bodies at the 
thoracolumbar
junction are of indeterminate age.

FINDINGS: 
Patient is status post right total knee arthroplasty which 
appears in normal
alignment without hardware complications or loosening.  There is 
a trace joint
effusion.  Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized 
without acute
fracture.  Vascular calcifications are noted.  No concerning 
lytic or
sclerotic osseous abnormalities detected.
 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute fracture or dislocation.  Status post right total knee 
arthroplasty
without hardware complications.  Small joint effusion.

joints with
subchondral sclerosis and mild joint space narrowing.  Patient 
is status post
L3-L4 laminectomies.
 
SOFT TISSUES:  A gallstone is seen in the partially imaged 
gallbladder which
appears distended.  The partially imaged right kidney 
demonstrates several
hypodense cysts as well as an intermediate density cyst arising 
from the lower
pole (03:14) measuring 8 mm.  There is large stool burden in the 
rectum and
nonspecific presacral fat stranding.  Diverticulosis of the 
colon is noted,
without evidence of diverticulitis.  Calcified and hypodense 
fibroids are
noted within a bulky uterus.  A left inguinal hernia containing 
fat is noted. 
There is diffuse soft tissue anasarca. Severe atherosclerotic 
vascular
calcifications are noted.  Coarse calcifications in the 
bilateral gluteal
regions likely represent injection granulomas.  No joint 
effusion is seen.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or dislocation.
2. Large stool burden in the rectum with nonspecific presacral 
fat stranding.
3. Colonic diverticulosis.
4. Fibroid uterus.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Partially imaged right lower pole renal cysts, one of which 
is intermediate
in density and could be further assessed with dedicated renal 
ultrasound.

___ R HIP XR
FINDINGS: 
The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.  No acute 
fracture or
dislocation is present.  Mild degenerative changes are seen 
involving the
right femoroacetabular joint with subchondral sclerosis and 
joint space
narrowing.  No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous 
abnormalities detected. 
Scattered vascular calcifications are seen.  Coarse 
heterogeneous
calcification in the imaged right pelvis is compatible with a 
calcified
fibroid uterus.  Large amount of stool is partially imaged 
within the rectum.
 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute fracture or dislocation.  No findings to suggest 
avascular necrosis. 
Mild degenerative changes of the right hip joint.

___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular 
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is 
normal (2.1 cm; nl>1.6cm) consistent with normal right 
ventricular systolic function. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. 
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic 
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle. Normal 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic 
and mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
Severe pulmonary hypertension. No valvular vegetations seen. 

___ CXR AP
IMPRESSION: 
Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
Persistent tear of mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality may 
be due to
chronic lung disease rather than edema.  Heart size is 
top-normal.  Pleural
effusions small if any.  No pneumothorax.
 
Atherosclerotic calcification is heavy in the normal size 
thoracic aorta.
 
PA and lateral chest radiograph strongly recommended for 
evaluation of the
lower lobes and possible pneumonia on the left.
 
Healed left upper rib fractures noted.

___ MRI R HIP WO CONTRAST
FINDINGS: 
There is normal marrow signal within the right femoral head. 
There is no
evidence of avascular necrosis, fracture, stress fracture. The 
marrow signal
throughout the rest of the pelvis is within normal limits. The 
imaged
sacroiliac joints show no erosive changes.
 
Focused imaging of the right hip demonstrates a small amount of 
joint fluid.
There is moderate loss of joint space with thinning of the 
articular
cartilage.  There is a superior lateral labral tear.
 
Minimal fluid seen in the trochanteric bursa.  There is mild to 
moderate
insertional tendinopathy involving the gluteus medius tendon.  
Mild
insertional tendinopathy of the hamstrings onto the ischial 
tuberosity.
 
Limited assessment of intra-pelvic soft tissue structures 
demonstrates a large
fluid filled structure in the right hemipelvis measuring 5.1 x 
5.5 cm) with an
internal solid component. No gross intrapelvic fluid.
 
Diffuse generalized anasarca are seen within the soft tissues of 
the imaged
pelvis and proximal lower extremities.
 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No significant right hip joint effusion.  Normal marrow 
signal in the
pelvis or right femur, no definite evidence for septic joint. .  
Mild
insertional tendinopathy involving the gluteus medius and 
hamstring tendons.
 
Incidental large cystic lesion with internal solid component in 
the right
hemipelvis, recommend further assessment with a transvaginal 
ultrasound to
exclude an endometrial/ovarian mass.

___ PELVIC US
FINDINGS: 
The uterus is anteverted and measures approximately 8.1 x 5.4 x 
6.0 cm and
contains fibroids. The endometrium is dilated with a large 
amount anechoic
fluid contains debris an echogenic nodule measuring 1.6 x 1.2 
cm,
corresponding to nodularity as seen on MRI. No increased 
internal vascularity
noted.
 
The ovaries are not visualized.  There is no free fluid.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Fluid-filled dilated endometrial cavity may suggest cervical 
stenosis
without features to suggest infection.
2. Redemonstrated 1.6 x 1.2 cm endometrial solid nodule as seen 
on prior MRI. 
Differential considerations favor a intrauterine fibroid, 
although endometrial
polyp is difficult to exclude.

she already completed a course of zosyn x14d. TTE negative for 
vegetation. The source of the ESBL E Coli is unknown but we 
considered GI vs GU, given her history of rectal prolapse per 
her report (she had seen a colorectal surgeon at ___). 
Colorectal surgery saw her during this admission and firmly 
believed her ectropion was not an infectious source. The E Coli 
was sensitive to meropenem. ID was consulted and she was treated 
with IV meropenem for 6 week course. Her ___ blood culture was 
positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, but this was 
speciated to coag negative staph and was likely a contaminant. 

#Leukocytosis: Initially elevated to ___ iso bacteremia as well 
chronic elevation from steroid use. Downtrending on discharge to 
baseline with treatment of bacteremia as above. Discharge WBC: 
16.8. 

#Septic Joint
Initially concerning for septic arthritis vs. trochanteric 
bursitis.
Atraumatic hip pain. Joint aspirate with 22K WBCs and Hct 22,
negative culture. However she had already received two days of 
antibiotics at the time of aspiration. She was seen by ortho, 
who thought her pain was likely trochanteric bursitis. GNRs 
would also be an atypical cause of septic arthritis, but the hip 
could have been seeded during her recent bacteremia. Rheum and 
ID both agreed with the diagnosis of a likely septic joint and 
recommend wash out, which was deferred by orthopedics. An MRI R 
hip was obtained notable for small effusion with no evidence of 
a septic joint. Rheumatology was concerned that she may not 
improve with antibiotics alone given the severity of her RA, 
however, the decision was made to treat the patient 
conservatively with IV antibiotics. Patient seemed to improve 
clinically with antibiotics with improved mobility at the joint 
so a wash-out was deferred in agreeance with all consulting 
services. She had a PICC line placed on ___ for continued 
antibiotics. 

#Incidental Uterine Mass
#Cervical stenosis
Incidentally found mass seen on her MRI of her R hip. She had a 
follow up pelvic US which showed a likely fibroid vs. polyp. The 
ultrasound also revealed a fluid filled uterine cavity 
concerning for cervical stenosis. The patient was asymptomatic. 
She will need outpatient gynecology follow-up. 

#ESRD on HD 
#Hyperkalemia
Initially became fluid overloaded and hyperkalemic in the 
setting of missing HD. Transferred to the ICU for 2 days until 
stabilized with emergent HD and returned to the floor. Her 
hyperkalemia was treated with insulin/Calcium. Discharge K 5.8 
after which she received HD. On MWF HD. Access: LUE AVF. 

#Macrocytic Anemia
Most likely secondary to ESRD. MCV 101-102. Folate normal. B12
low-normal 389. Recommend serum or urine MMA as outpatient to 
assess for B12 deficiency as a low normal B12 may still be 
deficient at the tissue level.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Hypertension. Remained hypertensive to 180s, but asymptomatic.
Her home regimen was continued as below: 
On HD days: Hydral 25 BID, labetalol 300 BID
On non-HD days: Hydral 25 TID, labetalol 300 TID, amlodipine 10
On all days: Lisinopril 10
Her lisinopril was increased to 20 mg po daily in light of 
continued high blood pressures. 

#Rheumatoid arthritis 
Initially give 10 mg prednisone po daily and titrated down to 
7.5 mg as per rheumatology recs. 

#COPD on 2L home O2 
There is some concern that her respiratory disease is actually
due to ILD in the setting of her RA. Could consider PFTs as an
outpatient. She received O2 and her home nebulizers

#Hypothyroidism 
She was continued on levothyroxine 125 mcg daily. 

#Anxiety/depression 
She was continued on her home pregabalin, clonazepam, sertraline 
and trazodone. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Please ensure patient completes her 6 week course of 
antibiotics, ___, and follows up with OPAT
[] Please check blood pressure as outpatient, of note blood 
pressures elevated to the 180s and 190s systolic during her 
admission. Consider up titration of her lisinopril as needed.
[] Please check a CBC and BMP to monitor her leukocytosis to 
check for hyperkalemia
[] please check serum or urine methylmalonic acid given 
borderline low Vitamin B12 (389), which may contribute to 
patient's microcytic anemia 
[] Please consider outpatient PFTs to better assess whether her 
lung disease is due to her COPD or ILD secondary to RA, or a 
mixed picture. Also consider a sleep study to r/o OSA. 
[] Please follow-up with OBGYN for uterine mass (fibroid vs. 
polyp) as well cervical stenosis.
[] R lower pole of kidney showing renal cysts, recommend a 
dedicated renal ultrasound to evaluate nonurgently. 
[] Patient reported breaking of lower teeth during this 
admission of unclear etiology. No reported trauma. Attempted to 
obtain a panorex, but patient was unable to tolerate. Please 
consider follow-up outpatient.

awaiting ophthalmologic procedure for her eye discomfort, and 
her ophthalmologist at ___ Eye & ___ has recommended complete 
cardiac work up prior to this procedure (details unclear as 
notes are out of our system; however, per Dr. ___ 
note from ___ it is ""non urgent""). In addition, per Dr. 
___ from ___, cardiac catheterization is 
indicated to evaluate for left main disease prior to surgery 
requiring monitored anesthesia care, as well as to further 
evaluate for coronary artery disease given her multiple risk 
factors for atherosclerosis.  She had cardiac catheterization 
planned recently, although this procedure was cancelled given 
her aspirin allergy and the possible need for intervention. The 
patient was given the option of waiting for allergy appointment 
to further evaluate this allergy or for CCU admission for rapid 
desensitization, and chose the latter.

CXR (___):
In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung 
volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse 
diameter of the heart. There is fullness of indistinct pulmonary 
vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, 
beyond that which would be expected with poor inspiration on a 
portable examination. 

Cardiac Cath (___): 
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed 
no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LMCA 
was free 
from angiographic disease.  The LAD had mild plaquing. The 
ostial 
diagonal branch demonstrated 60% focal stenosis.  The LCx was a 
small 
vessel giving rise to a large OM1 (functionally a ramus 
intermedis) and 
four other tiny OMs.  The RCA was a large dominant vessel with 
mild 
plaquing. 
  
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided 
filling 
pressures with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and LVEDP of 18 mm Hg. There 
was 
moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 
52 mm Hg. 
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.17 L/min/m2.  There was 
significant 
systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP 181 mmHg.  
Diastolic 
blood pressures was 82 mm Hg. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 
___ F with multiple medical problems and recent complaints of 
worsening dyspnea on exertion who presents for planned CCU 
admission for aspirin desensitization prior to cardiac 
catheterization for further work up of DOE.  
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# Diastolic CHF: Pt has diastolic CHF based on cardiac cath, and 
given the absence of coronary disease, this is likely the cause 
of her exertional dyspnea. This is consistent with her 
longstanding history of HTN. She was diuresed with IV lasix and 
her home lasix was increased to 20mg po daily. She was also 
started on metoprolol succinate 50 mg qday and lisinopril 2.5mg 
po qday. At the time of discharge she was asymptomatic and her 
weight was 64.5kg.  
.
# Pulmonary HTN: Pt has significant pulmonary HTN (PA pressure 
52/___) based on cardiac cath, and this is likely also 
contributing to exertional dyspnea. This is likely ___ her left 
sided diastolic CHF, but given history of bronchiectasis, cannot 
rule out a primary pulmonary component to her elevated PA 
pressures. She was discarged on ACEI, diuretic and beta blocker 
per above. 
.
# ASA Allergy: Pt underwent successful ASA desensitization. ASA 
reaction is documented as urticaria/angioedema, but during 
desensitization she only experienced pruritis without other 
manifestations of hypersensitivity. She was desensitized per 
___ protocol without indicent and should continue taking ASA 
81 indefinately to prevent recurrence of hypersensitivity.  
.
# HTN: Her metoprolol tartrate 25mg qday was changed to 
metoprolol succinate 50mg qday. Her lasix was increaed to 10mg 
qday and she was started on lisinopril 2.5mg qday. Her BP was 
well controlled on this regemin while hospitalzied, but her 
medications should be further titrated by her PCP as an 
outpatient.
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.
# DIABETES: Last HbA1c in ___ was 5.7%. Currently off all 
medication. She was covered with ISS while in house her BG was 
well controlled
.  
# ANEMIA: Her home folic acid and B12 were continued. Her Hct 
remained stable in the low/normal range throughout her hospital 
course and no intervention was undertaken.
.  
# JOINT PAIN: Multifactorial (has RA vs. PMR and osteoarthritis 
by history, also status post bilateral total knee arthroplasty). 
She was continued on her home Voltaren 1% gel, sulfasalazine and 
Ca/Vit D and her pain was well controlled on tylenol prn. Pt is 
followed by rheum, who will see her as an outpatient. 
.  
# VASOACTIVE SYMPTOMS S/P MENOPAUSE: She was continued on her 
home Premarin 0.9 mg PO daily; should follow up with PCP 
regarding weaning estrogen. 
.  
# PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES: She was contined on her home mirtazapine 
and venlafaxine. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: She was discahrged home with Cardiology, 
PCP, ___ and Allergy/Immunology follow up. Dietary teaching 
was performed regarding the importance of low Na diet and 
warning signs about fluid overload.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a cardiac catheterization to test for 
heart problems that were causing your breathing trouble and 
chest pain. You did not have any significant blockages in your 
heart arteries but we did find that you had too much fluid in 
your body that wa affecting your breathing and making you tired. 
We gave you some intravenous furosemide to get rid of the fluid 
and will have you take 20 mg of furosemide daily instead of 10 
mg to keep the fluid from coming back. If your breathing worsens 
again, this means that the fluid is coming back. Weigh yourself 
every morning, call Dr. ___ weight goes up more than 3 
lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. It is very important that 
you avoid salt in your cooking and check the ingredients for 
high salt content. You can have about 2000mg of salt daily. 
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. Increase furosemide to 20 mg daily
2. Stop taking metoprolol tartrate, take metoprolol succinate 
instead once a day
3. Start aspirin 81 mg daily, do not stop taking this medicine 
unless Dr. ___ you to. 
4. Start lisinopril 2.5 mg daily to lower your blood pressure. 
 
Followup Instructions:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed male with a history of
focal epilepsy (probable temporal) who recently established care
with Dr. ___ in ___ who presents with increased seizure
frequency. 

History obtained from patient and medical record. He first saw
Dr. ___ in ___ with complaints of amnesia. At that time
he reported discrete ___ minute episodes of confusion (not
remember what day it was, repeating himself) which would resolve
and he would go back to feeling completely normal. He never had
any warning regarding this episodes. These were occurring about 
2
times per month. Provocation was stress and decreased sleep.
Please see Dr. ___ note from ___ regarding
the details.   

Dr. ___ his history was consistent with epilepsy (focal,
probably temporal) and he was started on Keppra 500 mg BID at
that time (___). He also had a 48 hour ambulatory EGG which
showed ""bitemporal independent and  occasional bitemporal
synchronous slowing along with relatively infrequent 
bursts of more generalized but centrally predominant theta
activity. These  findings are relatively nonspecific and may
represent underlying multifocal  subcortical pathological
abnormalities, vascular disease or sequela of 
traumatic head injury. No seizure activity was acquired during
the recording sessions. No interictal epileptic activity was
noted.""

Since he saw Dr. ___ in ___, he reports full compliance with
his Keppra. He has not been sick recently and has had no 
interval
head trauma. He has trouble remembering the details of what
brought him to the hospital today but thinks it was because of
""brain farts"" which are his seizures. Unfortunately his family
cannot be reached as he cannot remember their numbers (but he
says he would not usually remember them). Mr. ___ thinks he
did not have any seizures up until his recent episode which
brought him to the hospital. He reports that he cannot remember
what happened but he thinks he had a seizure at church
(___). He does not remember the interval history but
reports that he feels back to his normal self. 

Review of limited ___ records indicate that his family
brought him to the hospital on ___ with concern for increased
seizure frequency. He reportedly was having staring episodes and
repeating himself for ___ days leading up to presentations. The
episodes were more frequently and lasting longer so they finally
took him to the hospital. At ___, he was having episodes of
staring into space and repeating himself. This was of unclear
duration. He was given Ativan 2 mg IV x1 and Keppra 1 g x1. WBC
7.1, Na 137, Cr 0.9, BG 110, LFTs normal, UA non-inflammatory,

Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness and incoordination
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endobronchial biopsy of right and left lung nodules

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with a history of
prostate CA s/p radiation, hyperlipidemia, cervical spine
disease, and longstanding tobacco use who presents with left
sided weakness and incoordination over the last 10 days. He
reports that he had ""the flu"" about 6 weeks ago with URI 
symptoms
and muscle aches. This resolved, but then about 2 weeks ago he
began to have muscle aches again that felt very similar. These
started in his left quadriceps and then spread over the next
several days to involve his bilateral quadriceps, calves, and
triceps as well. He saw his PCP ___ ___ for his annual physical
and then again on ___ due to the persistent myalgias. At that
point he had also begun to experience intermittent vertigo as
well. This was only present with movement such as turning his
head or standing up to walk and resolved completely at rest. He
describes it as a brief sensation of spinning or movement 
lasting
seconds. CK and ESR were checked due to the myalgias and were
negative. His vertigo was felt to be most likely peripheral.
Basic labs were all normal and he was advised to monitor his
symptoms. 

However over the next week his vertigo persisted, still only
brought on by movement, and he also began to notice weakness in
his left arm and leg. He initially attributed this to the muscle
aches, which ultimately resolved on the right but have still
persisted a little in his left quad and triceps. However over 
the
last week he has also noticed that it is more difficult to
control his left arm and leg. He says they feel weak but also
clumsy, and his arm ""flops around"" when he tries to use it. His
wife says he also veers toward the left when he walks, and his
left leg has ""given out"" on him a couple of times. He has fallen
twice in the last week, once when getting out of the car and 
then
again yesterday when he was trying to help his wife make up the
bed. Both times his left leg just seemed to buckle and he fell 
to
the ground, sustaining some scrapes but no significant injuries.
Last night he was playing cards with his friends, which he has
done for ___ years, and realized that he couldn't hold the cards
or shuffle with his left hand. At this point he became 
concerned,
as he says one of his other friends in the group had a stroke a
few years ago with very similar symptoms. He therefore went back
to Dr. ___ this morning, and on exam he was found to
have left sided weakness and ataxia and was sent to the ED for
further evaluation.

In addition he also reports one episode of headache last week on
___, around the time that he first noticed the left sided
weakness. He describes the headache as bifrontal pressure with 
no
other associated symptoms. This was a bit unusual for him as he
does not typically get headaches but it resolved on its own and
has not recurred. He also noticed brief blurring of vision in 
his
left eye around the same time which also lasted for about a day
and then resolved. He denies any diplopia or loss of vision. He
reports that he has chronic tingling in his left arm and hand 
due
to an ulnar nerve injury many years ago, but this has seemed a
bit more prominent lately than usual. He denies any numbness or
tingling in his face or leg. He denies any problems with his
speech.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, diplopia, 
dysarthria,
dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech. No bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or

PATHOLOGY: 
- Lung biopsies (___): ***PATHOLOGY PENDING***

STUDIES: 

- NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT (___): Findings concerning for multiple 
intracranial lesions which raises suspicion for metastatic 
disease.  Correlate with history of malignancy. MRI would be 
helpful for further evaluation. 

- CTA HEAD/NECK (___):  
1. Three distinct heterogeneously-enhancing parenchymal lesions, 
with cystic necrosis, within the superior cerebellar vermis, and 
the left frontal and parietal lobe, worrisome for metastatic 
disease. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
2. Mild effacement of the left ambient cistern. 
3. 2.7 cm soft tissue mass within the azygos lobe with an 
associated 3.2 cm necrotic precarinal lymph node which may 
represent primary bronchogenic neoplasm with metastatic 
lymphadenopathy. 
4. Patent vasculature. No aneurysm, dissection, or stenosis. 

- MRI BRAIN W/WO GAD (___): 
1. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior frontal and left 
medial 
occipital regions, which may be leptomeningeal or superficial 
cortical, 
without significant mass effect. Punctate left superior frontal 
cortical 
metastasis adjacent to the larger left frontal metastasis. 
2. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior cerebellar vermis 
and left 
cerebellar hemisphere. The dominant metastasis in the left 
cerebellar vermis effaces the left ambient cistern with 
deformation of the left inferior colliculus. It also partially 
effaces the fourth ventricle without obstructive hydrocephalus. 
3. 4 mm enhancing lesion in the superior right aspect of the 
occipital bone, corresponding to a lytic lesion with erosion of 
the outer table on the prior CT, indicating an osseous 
metastasis. 
  
COMMENT: The appearance of the intracranial and calvarial 
lesions is more suggestive of metastatic disease from the right 
apical pulmonary mass seen on the preceding CTA, than from 
prostate cancer, but tissue diagnosis is needed. 

CT ___ W CONTRAST (___):  
1. Multiple enlarged low-attenuation mediastinal lymph nodes and 
right hilar lymph node. A 1.4 cm subpleural nodule in the right 
upper lobe. Adjacent to/contiguous with the necrotic right upper 
paratracheal lymph node. Multiple pulmonary nodules identified 
measuring up to 5 mm. Findings are suspicious of pulmonary and 
nodal metastases. The mediastinal lymph nodes are amenable for 
biopsy via bronchoscopy. 
2. A 1.5 cm and 1.6 cm hypodense lesions in segment 2 and 4B 
nonspecific but suspicious for hepatic metastasis, especially 
segment 4B lesion. 
3. 3.5 cm solid lesion identified posterior to the left psoas 
muscle, 
suspicious for metastasis. This lesion is amenable for biopsy 
under CT 
guidance, if necessary. 
4. Enlarged necrotic lymph nodes at the left external iliac and 
left common iliac chain, suspicious for nodal metastases. 
5. Cholelithiasis. Small hiatal hernia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo RH M with a history of prostate CA s/p radiation, 
hyperlipidemia, cervical spine disease, and tobacco use who 
presents with left sided weakness and incoordination over the 
last 10 days. In the ED, head CT showed 3 lesions with central 
hemorrhage/necrosis and vasogenic edema in the left frontal 
lobe, left parietal lobe, and most notably in the left 
cerebellar vermis coming close to impinging on the ___ 
ventricle, with no hydrocephalus. CTA head/neck incidentally 
revealed a mass in the right upper lung with adjacent necrotic 
lymph nodes. The findings were highly concerning for metastatic 
cancer. 

# HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Neurology service for 
further workup. MRI brain confirmed presence of hemorrhagic 
metastases in the left frontal and parietal lobes and left 
cerebellar hemisphere with small amount of vasogenic edema. CT 
torso revealed multiple lesions concerning for metastatic cancer 
-- enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, 1.4cm RUL nodule and 
multiple other pulmonary nodules, 2 liver lesions, solid lesion 
posterior to the left psoas, and enlarged necrotic left iliac 
lymph nodes. Given his smoking history and distribution of the 
lesions, findings were highly suspicious for metastatic lung 
cancer. 

The next day an endobronchial biopsy of the right lung and LNs 
was obtained by Interventional Pulmonology (results pending on 
discharge). Hematology-Oncology, Neuro-Oncology, Neurosurgery 
and Radiation Oncology services consulted for workup and 
planning. Given the size of the cerebellar mass and its close 
proximity to the ___ ventricle, it was felt that patient would 
need whole brain radiation (fractionated radiotherapy to the 
area would cause too much swelling and thus hydrocephalus, and 
surgical resection would be unsafe given his age and 
comorbidities). After much debate, it was decided that he needed 
EVD placed before beginning whole brain XRT since risk for 
subsequent edema and hydrocephalus was still high. This will be 
performed one week after discharge, on ___ -- 
patient will be called beforehand with time and name of 
neurosurgeon doing the procedure. Following EVD placement, he 
will see Radiation Oncology (Dr. ___ in clinic to begin 
planning for whole-brain radiation. They anticipate beginning 
XRT one week after surgery in order to allow superficial wound 
healing. 

Patient was started on Dexamethasone 4mg qAM (with GI 
prophylaxis) in the hospital for additional for additional 
protection against vasogenic edema. He was also given oxycodone 
on discharge for left hip pain caused by metastases to the area, 
which cause him significant discomfort. 

At the time of discharge, results of the lung biopsy are still 
pending. Once they return, Heme-Onc will coordinate follow up 
and planning for systemic therapy in the appropriate clinic 
(most likely Thoracic Oncology, given high suspicion that this 
is lung cancer). 

Patient was seen by Social Work in the hospital to address 
coping with his new diagnosis and for assistance obtaining 
long-term disability and transportation to future appointments 
at ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for new clumsiness and 
weakness on the left side of your body. An MRI of your brain 
showed 3 masses concerning for metastatic cancer, one of which 
was in an area called the CEREBELLUM and carries a high risk for 
causing brain cancer (HYDROCEPHALUS). A subsequent CT scan of 
your torso showed masses in your lymph nodes, lungs and liver 
also concerning for cancer. A lung biopsy was performed, results 
pending. 

The next step in your care will be to start whole brain 
radiation. Before this, you will need a ventriculo-peritoneal 
(VP) shunt. This will be done on ___. You will 
be called by the Neurosurgery apartment with the name of the 
surgeon who will perform the operation and the time of surgery. 

Approximately 3 days after shunt placement, you should attend 
your follow-up appointment with Radiation Oncology. They will 
coordination your radiation plan, as well as your follow-up 
appointments with Neuro-Oncology (___). You will be 
called by them to schedule this appointment in the next few 
days.

You are scheduled for an outpatient with Medical Oncology (Dr. 
___ on ___ to discuss the results of your lung 
biopsy, which should have returned by them. See below for more 
info. They will plan your systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or 
radiation) once the lung biopsy results have returned. 

We made the following changes to your medications: 
1. STARTED Dexamethasone (Decadron) 4mg by mouth in AM -- this 
is to treat swelling of the brain due to cancer. 
2. STARTED Famotidine 20mg twice daily -- this is to prevent 
acid reflux caused by Decadron. 
3. STARTED Oxycodone 2.5-5mg every 6 hrs as needed for pain -- 
side effects include nausea and constipation. Can take over the 
counter laxative as needed.
4. STARTED Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg every 8 hrs as needed for 
nausea -- if experienced as side effect of oxycodone.

Pre-bypass:
 The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic 
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion. There is a minimally increased gradient 
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are 
myxomatous. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen with 
posterior leaflet redundancy and prolapse. This affects P3 the 
most but is present throughout the posterior leaflet.. Due to 
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no 
pericardial effusion. Findings communicated at time of incision.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ F with history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis 
c/b diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension and 
encephalopathy currently on transplant list, IDDM, HTN and HLD 
who was directly admitted from home for acute renal failure.
  
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr < 1.5. Admitted with 
creatinine of 2.0, FeNa on admission 0.28% indicating pre-renal 
state. No evidence of infection on admission without fevers, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, suprapubic tenderness or dysuria, UA 
with epis and does not indicate UTI. Patient received albumin 
1g/kg (62.5grams) on HD 1 and morning after creatinine improved 
to 1.7. On HD 2 H/H was low so instead of albumin patient was 
volume challenged with 1 unit PRBCs and 25grams of albumin (1 
unit PRBCs=25 grams albumin). Diagnostic paracentesis ruled out 
SBP. Creatinine worsened after initial volume challenge and did 
not respond to second round of 1g/kg albumin. After failed 
improvement diagnosis of hepatorenal synrome was made and 
midodrine/octreotide were started and uptitrated without 
improvement in creatinine.  Cr steadily continued to rise, 
patient became oliguric and was volume overloaded.  The renal 
team was consulted.  Initially, plan was for pt to have HD line 
placed in ___ and start dialysis.  However, given active bleeding 
(see below), she was trasferred to SICU and started on CVVH.
       
# Cirrhosis: Chronic, related to schistosomiasis complicated by 
diuretic refractory ascites, chronic renal failure, portal 
hypertension, thrombocytopenia, prior SBP and encephalopathy. 
MELD 20 on admission with Childs Class C. Without evidence of 
encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation or asterixis on 
admission. Continued Rifaximin 550mg PO BID and Lactulose TID 
for HE prophylaxis. Continued Ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. 
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed and ruled out SBP. No GI 
endoscopy in our system but patient being evaluated for 
transplant, cannot be on transplant list without endoscopy so 
presumably completed somewhere. MELD rose to >30 in setting of 
hepatorenal syndrome and patient was listed for ABO incompatible 
liver. As HRS progressed, MELD score was at 40 on transfer to 
the SICU.

# Pulmonary edema: Pt w/ pulm edema on CXR on ___ and mildly 
symptomatic. Initially, pt subjectively some SOB, but O2 low to 
mid ___ on RA.  After 2 days, developed O2 requirement.  
Overload most likely in the setting of rapidly deteriorating 
renal function.  Less likely cirrhosis induced cardiomyopathy.  
Last TTE ___ with normal EF.  Repeat TTE with still normal EF 
but new moderate PA systolic HTN. Attempted to diurese with 
Lasix 20 iv then 80, put out very small amt of urine, 
incontinent.   In setting of rapidly progressive HRS, pt became 
oliguric and was unable to mobilize fluid.  Plan was made for 
dialysis as above.

# Hard palate bleed:  On ___ at ~6am, pt developed bleed right 
hard palate.  This was likely ___ mild oral trauma in the 
setting of coagulopathy--INR 3.6, platelets 75.  Initially, 
attempted to stop by applying pressure, unsuccessful.  Per 
discussion with ENT and OMFS, attempted to stop the bleed with 
afrin soaked gauze, topical thrombin, silver nitrate, 
aminocaproic acid.  Also transfused with platelets, FFP, and 
RBCs (as hct was 22 down from 25 at last check). Held continuous 
pressure for ~3 hours.  As soon as pressure was released, active 
bleeding was visualized.  Tamponaded bleed for ~10 minutes, but 
again continued to have uncontrollable bleed and was transferred 
to SICU on the transplant surgery service for elective 
intubation and packing.  The lesion was cauterized and the 
bleeding was controlled.  She was initially successfully 
extubated at transferred to the floor. 

# Hyponatremia: Hypervolumic hyponatremia from cirrhosis. Did 
not diurese patient given ___. Albumin and PRBCs given for 
intravascular volume and patient kept on 1.5L fluid restricted 
diet. She remained hyponatremic so fluid restricted further to 
1.2L with improvement in Na.
    
# Acute anemia: Patient with chronic anemia related to cirrhosis 
though with acute drop on HD 2. Unclear etiology without GIB 
during admission. Unknown if patient has varices without 
endoscopy in our system and is not on beta-blocker so presumably 
none on prior endoscopy. Possible hct drop was in setting of 
volume challenge overnight and dilutional effect though WBC and 
platelets unchanged. She was transfused 1 unit PRBCs both for 
anemia and volume challenge. Hct remained stable following 
transfusion.
     
# DM: Insulin Dependent, Type II. Hyperglycemic during admissin. 
Continued Glargine 12 units qHS and HISS
    
# HLD: Chronic, stable, continue zetia 
   
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Continue holding diuretics
- Recommend tracking down endoscopy report, unknown where 
completed

ICU Course ___ to ___, date of death)
Ms ___ was transferred to the surgical ICU the morning of 
___ after developing worsening melena. She had an EGD the day 
prior for the purpose of Dobhoff feeding tube placement, and 
during that EGD a duodenal polyp was noted and biopsied. Of 
note, she had an INR of 2.5 and fibrinogen of 59 prior to the 
procedure so snare removal of the polyp was deferred. The 
evening following the EGD, she had several episodes of melena 
thus prompting transfer to the ICU to facilitate repeat emergent 
EGD. The EGD ___ showed a lot of old blood around the polyp, but 
no active bleed from the stalk. 
The first few days in the SICU she remained HD stable, but 
continued to have melena with an unstable hematocrit. We 
transfused RBC, FFP, platelets and cryo to goal Hct of 30 and 
correct her coagulopathy. We were unable to completely correct 
her, and she began having significant oral bleeding. By ___, 
she was coughing blood, had an increased oxygen requirement. She 
remained encephalopathic and was not protecting her airway 
sufficiently so she was intubated. After intubation she had a 
pressor requirement which remained until time of death. She was 
started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/mica) and a CT 
torso showed severe pneumonia with very little residual aerated 
lung volume. 
On ___ she was begun on CVVH for acidosis and had increased 
pressor requirement with the addition of vasopressin. We 
continued to transfuse RBC/FFP/cryo to maintain blood levels.
On ___ she had increased pressor requirement and markedly 
increased oral bleeding. It was estimated she bleed 600cc 
periorally this day. Transfusions continued and she remained on 
high dose levo/vaso, though her pressor requirement was slightly 
less than the day prior. A family meeting was held. It was 
decided she would not want to be on full life support for more 
than 5 days. As it had been 3 days to this point, we decided to 
make a final decision ___ unless she acutely worsened.
On ___, the day of her death, she acutely worsened during the 
day. She became hypotensive despite increasing her pressor 
doses. Melena and oral bleeding increased and she grew 
increasingly tachycardic. She was not responding hemodynamically 
to significant product transfusion, and her ventilator settings 
were increased with more oxygen needed. Another family meeting 
was held and we discussed that she was decompensating rapidly 
and likely had an unsurvivable condition. The family present was 
receptive and understanding. She was transitioned to comfort 
care at 7pm, though the endotracheal tube was left in to prevent 
aspirating blood which we felt would cause her too much 
discomfort. She was started on a morphine drip. Her heart rate 
and blood pressure gradually declined and asystole occured at 
9:28pm. She was declared at 9:30pm. The family declined an 
autopsy.

","||startoftext||The patient is a 69-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure. She has a history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and encephalopathy, and is currently on the transplant list. She was recently discharged from another hospital where she was admitted for abdominal distension, and was directly admitted to this hospital for acute renal failure. The patient's past medical history includes schistosomiasis complicated by cirrhosis and ascites, hypertension, IDDM, dyslipidemia, and nephrolithiasis.

The patient's allergies include aspirin. She has a history of bleeding, including a recent episode of hematochezia and melena, and has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome. She has also been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and has required oxygen therapy.

The patient's medications at discharge include midodrine and octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome, and rifaximin and lactulose for prophylaxis against hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient underwent several procedures during her hospital stay, including a diagnostic paracentesis, which ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and an EGD with feeding tube placement and duodenal polyp biopsy. She also underwent a TTE, which showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, including ALT, AST, and LDH, as well as elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Her creatinine level was elevated at 2.0 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was elevated at 28 mg/dL. Her albumin level was low at 3.7 g/dL, and her calcium level was elevated at 9.8 mg/dL.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was complicated by her underlying liver disease and acute renal failure, and she required multiple interventions to manage her symptoms and stabilize her condition. ||endoftext||"

ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with a recent admission 
___ ___ for multifocal pneumonia complicated by chronic 
respiratory failure further complicated recurrent PNA x2 at 
rehab s/p trach/PEG, decannulated on ___. She presented for 
this admission with 2 days of dyspnea and productive cough, and 
was found to be hypoxemic requiring high-flow oxygen. CXR showed 
possible pneumonia and completed course of antibiotics 
(Vanc/ceftazidime, Day 1: ___. Her respiratory failure was 
thought to be secondary to recurrent aspiration related to her 
neuromuscular disease. She was given hypertonic saline nebs, 
guaiafenesin, Duonebs, pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve. She 
required intubation, and was unable to be weaned off the 
ventilator. After numerous goals of care discussions with the 
ICU team, her outpatient pulmonologist, palliative care, and her 
family, decision was made to undergo trach/PEG on ___. She 
tolerated this well, and was able to be weaned off the 
ventilator by ___, when she was transferred to floor. Cuff 
pressures were high, but patient had been tolerating this well. 
She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES
-- NEW: senna PRN and Colace PRN constipation
-- HELD: loperamide (as noted above, consider low dose trial if 
she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools. 
[ ] Continue to discuss goals of care with patient  
[ ] Patient will follow up with the interventional 
pulmonologists for further monitoring of her tracheostomy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

","||startoftext||The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has allergies to penicillins and oxybutynin. The patient's chief complaint was hypoxia, dyspnea, productive cough, and congestion, which she experienced for the past two days. She was previously intubated and had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was referred to the emergency department for stoma closure and was found to have tachypnea, rhonchorous lungs, and a stoma site. The patient was given various medications, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and cefepime. She was also given oxygen therapy and had a flutter valve inserted. The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, and normal abdominal examination. The patient's laboratory results showed anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Imaging studies revealed extensive atelectasis in the lower lungs, which could not exclude a superimposed pneumonia. The patient was discharged with a tracheostomy mask and speaking valve, and was advised to use a flutter valve and oxygen therapy. ||endoftext||"
