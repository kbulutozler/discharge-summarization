Brief Hospital Course:
___ with IDDM, possible pyoderma gangrenosum of the perianal 
area (on Humira since ___, hidradenitis suppuritiva L groin 
& R axilla, cognitive defect, transferred to ___ from ___ 
___ found to have NSTEMI on hep gtt with troponin 0.3 
downtrending to .22 with outside EKG <1mm lateral ST 
depressions, on CTA found to have 2.7cm upper left lobe nodule 
with significant hilar lymphadenopathy. Upon admission, patient 
was placed on a heparin drip and received PRN nitroglycerin for 
control of chest pain. Patient was taken to the cath lab on 
___ that showed 60% stenosis of his RCA and 30% stenosis of 
LCx. No intervention was performed. He was started on ASA, 
statin a beta-blocker for his CAD. Patient continued to complain 
of chest pain, but given the cath results this was thought to be 
unlikely caused by cardiac disease. He had an incidental finding 
of a RUL lung nodule and significant hilar lymphadenopathy. 
Patient reported recent night sweats with unintentional 30-lb 
weight loss. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with hilar lymph node biopsy as an 
outpatient. Additionally, the patient had on-going rectal pain 
due to his ___ wound. Dermatology and colorectal surgery 
were consulted and recommended wound care. Biopsies and further 
work up were deferred for the outpatient setting. Patient also 
developed loose stools with incontinence concerning for C diff 
given history. He was started and discharged with a prescription 
for PO vancomycin. 

  
 # CORONARIES: unknown
 # PUMP: unknown 
 # RHYTHM: sinus    

# NSTEMI: Patient presented with three days of chest pain, peak 
trop 0.3, EKG with <1mm STD in lateral leads. Patient EKG did 
show evidence of old inferolateral infarct. Patient was started 
on a heparin drip for NSTEMI. Chest pain required nitroglycerin 
and intermittently oxycodone/IV morphine for relief. Patient 
underwent coronary catheterization on ___ which revealed 
RCA 60% stenosis and LCx 30% stenosis. No intervention was 
performed. Patient began ASA, Atorvastatin, metoprolol for CAD 
medical management. Following cath, patient continued to have 
chest pain that was largely unchanged. Multiple EKGs pre and 
post cath did not show new changes or signs of ischemia. While 
the patient had documented CAD on cath, it is possible that some 
of his chest pain was also due to demand ischemia given give 
___ wounds. Pain ___ also be due to hilar 
lymphadenopathy found on CTA. Interventional pulmonology was 
consulted, please see explanation below for lung nodule/hilar 
lymphadenopathy.

# Pulmonary nodule: CT chest reveals discrete nodule  in LUL 
that is >2.0cm in diameter.  OSH started CTX and Doxy for CAP on 
___ but this was discontinued on ___ given no suspicion for 
PNA. Patient with reported history 30 pound weight loss, night 
sweats for ___ months. CTA was uploaded to ___ system for 
image review. Per wet read of radiology, most concerning on the 
CTA was significant hilar lymphadenopathy. History is concerning 
for possible lymphoma vs other malignancy vs infectious 
etiology. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with biopsy as an outpatient. Patient 
is scheduled for bronchoscopy on ___. 

# Hydradinitis Suppurative Lesions: Patient with lesions in  
axilla, groin, and perianal area are consistent with the 
distribution seen in hidradinitis suppurativa. He has started to 
see improvement in his right axillary lesion but his perianal 
lesions are unchanged.  Dermatology was consulted for re-biopsy 
of anal wound given concern given differing pathology reports 
and unclear diagnosis given refractory nature of his perianal 
lesion. There was no evidence of infection on exam. Colorectal 
surgery was also consulted who discussed patient case with derm. 
___ wounds are painful and of unclear etiology. DDx 
includes verrucous carcinoma vs pyoderma gangrenosum. Since 
patient had multiple previous biopsies by his outpatient 
dermatologist, the decision was made to defer further biopsies 
and discuss with his primary dermatologist as an outpatient. 
Patient was discharged home with wound care ___ services. Humira 
was restarted on discharge, held in-house. 
 
# Coagulopathy: INR elevated on admission to 1.6.  Liver 
synthetic function wnl.  INR remined stable but elevated 
throughout admission. 

# DMII: On metformin at home. Held metformin in the setting of 
potential cath. Last HbA1C 7.2% ___. Patient was given 
Humalog sliding scale while inpatient and discharged to continue 
home dose of metformin on discharge. 

****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES****
[ ] Follow up C diff studies. Discontinue PO vanc if negative. 
If patient, patient should complete 2 week course
[ ] Incidental nodule and hilar LAD on CT requiring 
bronchoscopy/biopsy. Ensure patient follows up with 
interventional pulmonology. Procedure is scheduled for ___ 
[ ] Did not require cath and chest pain is unlikely cardiac, but 
cath did show CAD; therefore, the patient was started on 
atorvastatin 80mg daily, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 BID and 
aspirin 81mg 
[ ] Patient reported attempting to self-taper his alprazolam. He 
was advised to do this under the guidance of a physician. Please 
follow up his benzo use and desire to taper.
[ ] Please ensure close follow up with outpatient dermatology. 
He has had no improvement on Humira thus far and there is strong 
suspicion that this ___ not be PG. Verrucous carcinoma is a 
likely alternative diagnosis. Colorectal surgery recommended 
repeat biopsy, but ___ derm elected to defer repeat biopsy to 
his outpatient provider.

IMAGING:
==========
Chest PA/lat ___
1. No pneumonia.
2. Opacity in the left lower lung base is likely due to nipple 
shadow,
however, a focal mass cannot be excluded.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Although likely due to nipple shadows, 
re-imaging with conventional chest radiographs are recommended 
for further evaluation of left lower lung opacity.

Paracentesis ___
Technically successful ultrasound-guided therapeutic 
paracentesis, with
removal of 5 L of straw-colored fluid.

Chest Portable ___
nterval extubation.  Decreased lung volumes with patchy 
bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Crowding of 
the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large 
effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal 
contours are likely stable given differences in patient 
positioning and inspiratory effort.

RUQ US ___:
1.  The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.  
2. The liver has a cirrhotic morphology.  No focal lesions seen. 
 
3.  Large volume ascites. 

CXR ___:
___ to ___.  Increasing retrocardiac opacity, 
suggestive of 
pneumonia or aspiration.  Stable right basal atelectasis.  
Moderate 
cardiomegaly persists.  In the interval, the patient has been 
intubated the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 
approximately 6 cm above the carinal. 

CXR ___:
No acute intrathoracic abnormality. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ EtOH cirrhosis MELD 17 complicated by resistant ascites 
requiring q2wk para, 3 cords of grade I varices ___ who is 
actively drinking presented to the ED with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, s/p endoscopy and banding and management of 
abdominal pain.

#Abdominal Pain: likely from ascites on admission, with 
diagnostic paracentesis completed showing no signs of SBP, 
followed by ___ guided therapeutic paracentesis. Abdominal pain 
controlled initially with oxycodone as needed, and then 
transitioned to tramadol. Her hospital course was then notable 
for a rising bilirubin.
Infectious workup was repeated with blood culture, CXR, and 
peritoneal culture which were all unrevealing. She was 
discharged to complete an antibiotic course for SBP prophylaxis 
in the setting of her variceal bleed as well as for her 
enterococcal UTI. She is discharged with instructions for blood 
work within 1 week  and a follow up with her primary 
hepatologist.

# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive at baseline 90/50's. On 
presentation to ED 80/40's; likely from acute blood loss in 
setting of hematemesis and possible GI bleed versus 
decompensated cirrhosis; patient also has ascites on exam 
concerning for an SBP.  Peritoneal fluid w/ 32 WBCs. Patient was 
transfused 4u on ___ and 1u ___ and maintained on levophed 
initially.  Prior to transfer to medicine floor, she was started 
on 10mg TID midodrine. 

# Upper GI Bleed: patient presented with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, tarry stools, with a history of 
varices/gastropathy/GAVE. Differential diagnosis includes PUD 
vs. variceal bleeding vs. bleeding from GAVE.  Patient was 
started on SBP prophylaxis with ceftriaxone and started on 
octreotide and PPI gtts. On ___, on admission to ICU, EGD was 
performed; banded 2 grade II/III varices during ICU admission. 
She was treated with Octeride gtt, PPI gtt, SBP with 
ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone was continued for 7 day course. Repeat 
blood counts remained stable and she was asymptomatic with 
orthostatic testing. As her hospital course stabilized, she was 
resumed on furosemide and spironolactone. 

# Urinary Enterococcus: Asymptomatic though in setting of 
hypotension concerning for infection. Patient received empiric 
IV vancomycin (___-), which was continued for a 7 day course 
for complicated UTI (last day ___. 
 
# Cirrhosis: MELD 17 ___ C. ___ be decompensated now 
given worsening BPs. Complicated by ascites, varices, 
encepholpathy, abdominal pain. No history of SBP. On 
lactulose/rifaxmin at home although unclear compliance. Diarrhea 
at baseline. Recent cold, no reversal of sleep/wake. Not 
encepholopathic. Actively drinking; therefore not a transplant 
candidate. Patient was continued on lactulose, rifaximin.  
Patient underwent thepareutic paracentesis in the ICU with 
removal of 3L. The Lasix/sprinolactone in the setting of her 
recent active GI bleeding and hypotension, resumed later on the 
hospital course, along with lactuose and rifaximin.

# Coagulopathy: INR 1.4. Plt 77. Around baseling. Likely 
secondary to liver disease and poor nutrition. 

# Alcohol abuse: About a bottle of wine daily. Last drink day 
prior to admission. Tachycardic and tremulous on exam.  Patient 
was placed on CIWA scale, treatment dose IV thiamine was 
initiated along with IV folate and multivitamin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
-Patient to complete SBP ppx course on ___
-Patient to complete enterococcal UTI course on ___
-Patient discharged on tramadol for her chronic abdominal pain, 
repeated paracentesis did not reveal evidence of SBP
- Patient discharged on sucralfate until she is seen in clinic 
follow up
- Patient ordered for CBC, Chem, LFTs to be collected on 
___ and faxed to the liver transplant clinic

1. Status post right temporal craniotomy with underlying 
temporal lobe 
resection with postsurgical changes including subcutaneous gas 
and 
pneumocephalus.   
2. Increased cerebral edema with sulcal and basal cistern 
effacement

MRI Brain ___ post-op
Postsurgical changes along the right temporal lobe without 
evidence of 
residual nodular enhancement.  Residual FLAIR signal 
hyperintensity along the medial temporal lobe with a new area of 
abnormal FLAIR posterior and lateral to surgical cavity with 
associated slow diffusion which could be related to postsurgical 
changes or ischemia.   

Echocardiogram ___
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The diameters of aorta 
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.  


TSH ___: 0.93
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the neuroscience step-down unit on 
the day of admission, ___. She continued on Dexamethasone 
4mg IV QH and Keppra 1,000mg PO BID. A head CTA and CT torso was 
ordered. Radiation oncology and neuro-oncology were consulted. 

The CT of the Torso was negative for any malignancy; an 8mm 
thyroid nodule was noted that will require an US on an 
outpatient basis.

On ___, the patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of the 
right temporal brain mass, which went well without complication. 
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient 
underwent a postoperative CT scan, which revealed no active 
bleeding. Afterwards, the patient was transferred to the floor 
where she remained stable overnight into ___. On ___ she 
udnerwent a WAND study in anticipation of going to the OR on 
___ for resection. 

On ___ she went to the operating room for a right temporal 
craniectomy for resection of intracranial lesion. She toelrated 
the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room, and 
transferred to the ICU post-operatively for observation and 
care. Post op CT scan showed no signs of bleed.  In the evening 
the patient had afib with RVR with HRs up to the 140s.  The 
patient was converted back to NSR overnight after going on a 
dilt drip. 

On ___ the patient continued to progress well in the ICU.  A 
cardiology consult was placed for the afib which recommended an 
echocardiogram, TSH, and starting her on metoprolol 12.5mg BID.  
These recommendations were followed. Her afib subsequently 
resolved. The MRI showed postsurgical changes along the right 
temporal lobe without evidence of residual nodular enhancement.  
Residual FLAIR signal hyperintensity along the medial temporal 
lobe with a new area of abnormal FLAIR posterior and lateral to 
surgical cavity with associated slow diffusion which could be 
related to postsurgical changes or ischemia. The echocardiogram 
was within normal limits. TSH level was normal (0.93).

On ___, the patient was transferred to the floor, and her diet 
was advanced as tolerated. She started to work with physical 
therapy.

___, the patient contintued to progress well on the floor.  
Physical therapy worked with her and fel that she was limited by 
lethargy, and once resolved,
would improve rapidly. Physical therapy felt the patient would 
benefit from another day of physical therapy on an inpatient 
basis. She will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient, but 
should remain on metoprolol. 

On ___, patient was re-evaluated by ___ and determined that she 
needed an additional day to work on stairs. On ___, patient 
received magnesium citrate to help encourage a BM. ___ evaluated 
her and determined she is safe to discharge home with ___. She

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a PMHx of EtOH cirrhosis, 
diverticulosis, and hypertension p/w progressively worsening 
abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
# ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA: CT scan showed mild colonic edema, 
possibly from infectious colitis vs. portal colopathy. Patient 
did not have any bowel movements for the first 24 hours of 
admission, indicating that CT findings were likely due to portal 
colopathy. Although her stools were loose, she was also taking 
lactulose. Abdominal pain may have been precipitated by 
continued alcohol abuse. Diagnostic para revealed 1 PMN. She was 
initially treated with cipro/flagyl, but patient refused these 
medications, and they were discontinued due to low suspicion of 
infection. She will follow-up with gynecology for possible 
pelvic congestion syndrome, which was noted on CT.  

# CIRRHOSIS: Secondary to alcohol abuse. Complicated by portal 
hypertension and ascites with recent hospitalizations for 
decompensation. No history of SBP, varices, or hepatic 
encephalopathy. Patient continues to drink alcohol despite 
emphasis from outpatient providers to abstain and declined to 
see a social worker during this admission. LFTs are consistent 
with continued alcohol use.   

# ASCITES: CT Abd/Pelvis with moderate ascites. Diagnostic 
paracentesis was negative for SBP. She underwent an 
ultrasound-guided therapeutic para draining 1.25L fluid by ___ on 
___. Her home furosemide and spironolactone were continued.  

# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: No history of hepatic encephalopathy. 
Her home lactulose and rifaximin were continued.   

# ETOH ABUSE: History of withdrawal seizures. She was monitored 
on a CIWA during this admission and required doses of diazepam 
initially. She had no complicated withdrawal sx during this 
admission. Folate and thiamine were continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient was concerned about her reducible umbilical hernia. 
Although she remains very high risk for surgical repair, she 
plans to seek a second opinion as an outpatient. This can be 
addressed at liver clinic followup
- Stool cultures pending on discharge
- Continue to encourage alcohol cessation. Patient declined to 
see a social worker during this admission.
- If she continues to be symptomatic, consider colonoscopy as 
outpatient to evaluate area of colopathy vs. colitis
- F/u with Ob-Gyn to evaluate possibility of pelvic congestion 
syndrome as contributor to her abdominal pain
- Patient should have electrolytes and liver labs checked within 
1 week of discharge, sent to Dr. ___ in the ___, 
Phone: ___ Fax: ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for abdominal pain and diarrhea. We initially 
treated you with antibiotics, but these were stopped as we had a 
low suspicion for infection. We drew cultures, which did not 
grow anything while you were here, and checked your stool for 
infection. You tested negative for C. diff, a common infection 
that could cause diarrhea. You should follow-up with your 
gynecologist to address other potential causes of abdominal 
pain. You also underwent a paracentesis while you were here to 
remove some fluid from your belly. 

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ team
