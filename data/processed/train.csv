Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the 
gynecology service after undergoing and IV guided drainage of a 
tuboovarian abscess noted on her left adnexa. Please see the 
operative report for full details.

Her immediate post op course was complicated by low grade fevers 
on post-operative day 1 and 2 and IV antibiotics were broadened 
to include gentamycin, clindamycin, and ampicillin. On post-op 
day 2, patient had an elevated WBC with increasing left shift 
and repeat pelvic ultrasound and CT pelvis with contrast was 
performed. Imaging was notable for a decreased left adnexal 
fluid collection of 3cm (decreased from 6cm on admission) and a 
new right rim-enhancing 1.3cm and 0.9 collection on the right 
adnexa. Interventional radiology was re-consulted but given 
improvement of WBC count and clinical improvement, additional 
drainage deferred. On post-op day 3, she was transitioned to PO 
levofloxacin and metronidazole. Patient remained afebrile and 
felt subjectively improved. 

During her stay she was noted to have negative gonorrhea, 
chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and HIV tested. Tumor markers were 
noted to be within normal limits. The fluid drained from her 
left adnexal mass grew no microorganisms and urine cultures were 
negative. 

On post-operative day 3, she was voiding spontaneously, her diet 
was advanced without difficulty, and she was transitioned to 
oral pain medications and oral antibiotocs.She was then 
discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up 
scheduled.

posterior temporal contusion).  Other possibilities included 
arteriovenous malformation or underlying mass.  The patient was 
admitted to the neurology ICU for further management.
.
Hospital Course by problem;
.
Neuro; The patient was loaded on keppra upon admission and 
continued at 1000 mg bid.  He was monitored initially with q1h 
neurochecks.  His systolic blood pressure was maintained between 
100-140 without intervention.  A repeat CT head showed a stable 
intraparenchymal and small subdural hematoma.  MRI brain showed 
no evidence of underlying mass.  A CTA showed no sign of 
vascular malformation.  The patient will undergo repeat MRI 
brain with and without contrast in ___ weeks for further 
evaluation of his hemorrhage.  He will continue on keppra at 
1000 mg bid for at least six months.  The patient was 
transferred to the neurology floor on HD#2.  There he was 
evaluated by ___ who found that he was stable and able to 
ambulate without assistance. A repeat head CT on ___ showed no 
change in the intraparenchymal or subdural bleeds. He did not 
have any seizure activity while in house.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F w/ PMH of presumed alcohol cirrhosis 
here with abdominal pain and increased girth secondary to 
worsening ascites who was discharged with improved pain.

Acute Issues:
#Abdominal pain- likely secondary to increased ascites as there 
was no intraperitoneal disease found on CT scan.  Furthermore 
her pain improved with therapeutic paracentis of 6.5L.  Her 
diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP.

Ascites fluid leak - due to persist fluid leak a suture was 
placed by surgery.  #This was successful in stopping the leak.  
Suture may be removed in approx 10 days from placement on the 
day of discharge.

#Cirrhosis- patient reported receiving her previous care at 
___. When she presented she had evidence of 
large amount of ascites. Normal coags and plateltes and low 
albumin. She had a therapeutic paracentesis -6.5L, and had 
leaking para site on the LLQ that required a figure 8 stitch to 
be placed to stop the leaking. She reported still drinking 
alcohol.  Labs performed here were negative for other sources of 
cirrhosis detectable by lab serology. She had no evidence of 
encephalopathy, no spider angiomas.  Her blood pressure ran low 
and she had mild hyponatremia.  Due to her low blood pressure 
(80s/50s) it was decided to hold her diuretics on discharge and 
that she would followup with her PCP in ___ couple of days to 
repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics at a low dose. 
She was counseled on adhering to a low sodium diet and fluid 
restriction of 2L. Suture to be removed the week of 
___ will have followup in the ___ clinic with 
Dr. ___ on ___. 

#Alcohol use- patient with alcohol use. She had presumed alcohol 
cirrhosis secondary to it.  She was placed on the CIWA scale and 
never scored or showed signs of withdrawal.

#Low blood pressure- patient had blood pressure in the ___. 
She had no orthostaic symptoms and her blood pressure increased 
with sitting and standing.  Her urine was dilute and therefore 
it was felt that this  was not secondary to volume depletion and 
could be due to her underlying liver disease.  

Chronic/transitional Issue:
#Hypertension- patient reported being on HCTZ on admission. This 
was held during her stay and at the time of discharge.  We do 
not anticipate restarting as an outpatient as the pt appears to 
have low BPs chronically from cirrhosis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.
You were admitted to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain. 
You had excessive fluid in your abdomen due to too much salt and 
fluid intake and not taking your diuretics (water pills).  You 
had this fluid removed by paracentesis. You had some continued 
output from the paracentesis site and had a stitch placed. This 
stitch should remain in place for 1 week and removed by a 
clinician at that time.
 It is very important that you avoid salt in your diet and do 
not take in too much fluid. We also recommend that you cut down 
on your alcohol use and seek assistance in ways to do this 
safely if you choose to do it. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, cirrhosis, and ascites. She presented with abdominal pain and was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Her chief complaint was abdominal pain, which was likely secondary to increased ascites. She had a diagnostic paracentesis, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was given zofran and morphine and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

The patient has a past medical history of EtOH abuse, cirrhosis, and ascites. She has allergies to epinephrine. She was prescribed several medications, including lasix, spironolactone, azithromycin, and levofloxacin, but was unsure why she was prescribed these medications.

The patient's physical exam revealed a firm, distended abdomen with a positive fluid wave and diffusely tender to palpation. She had no organomegaly appreciable. Her discharge physical exam revealed a firm, nondistended abdomen with a slight bulge of her umbilical hernia.

The patient's laboratory results showed mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase and normal liver function tests. Her urine analysis showed a trace of protein and a few white blood cells. Her ascites fluid analysis showed a high white blood cell count and a high protein level.

The patient's imaging studies showed low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and a small right pleural effusion on chest X-ray. Her RUQ ultrasound showed a nodular liver with coarsened echotexture and large volume ascites, compatible with hepatic cirrhosis. Her CT abdomen showed a nodular liver with large volume simple ascites and no signs of loculated fluid collection or bowel perforation.

The patient's hospital course was marked by an acute issue of abdominal pain, which was likely secondary to increased ascites. She had a therapeutic paracentesis of 6.5L and had a persisting fluid leak, which was successfully stopped with a suture. She was discharged with improved pain and was advised to follow up with her PCP in a couple of days to repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics. ||endoftext||"

___ CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:      
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 
two 
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had minimal disease 
with modest 
calcification. The LAD had moderate-severe diffuse disease in 
the 
mid-segment. There were serial 80% lesions in the LAD at the 
bifurcation 
with the D1. The D1 was a large bifurcating vessel with a 
proximal 80% 
lesion. There were left-right collaterals noted. The LCx was a 
non-dominant vessel without critical lesions. The RCA was a 
dominant 
vessel with origin 20% calcified lesion and mid-segment 90% 
lesion. There was mild distal RCA disease. 
2. There was normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP 120 mmHg 
and DBP 
64 bpm. 
3. Successful stenting of the mid-RCA with 3.0 X 28 mm Cypher 
___ 
___ to 3.25 mm with no residual stenosis (see PTCA 
comments for 
detail). 
4. No demonstrable critical ostial RCA disease as documented by 
MLD on 
IVUS. 
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with Cypher DES. 
.
___ Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There 
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the aortic regurgitation is reduced; other 
findings are similar.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with a PMH of HTN, 
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia who presents with an 
inferior STEMI. 
.  
#. CAD: The patient presented with chest pain and was found to 
have an inferior STEMI on EKG. The patient was taken emergently 
for cardiac catheterization on ___, during which time a ___ 
___ was placed in the RCA to a mid-segment 90% lesion. 
Moderately severe diffuse disease was noted in the mid-segment 
of the LAD and at the bifurcation of D1;this was poorly suitable 
for PCI because of the very diffuse and bifurcation disease. The 
patient tolerated cardiac cath very well, with no recurrence of 
chest pain during her hospital course. Peak CK was in the 170s, 
EKG changes were resolving post-cath. ___ Echo showed no 
evidence of systolic dysfunction or WMA. The patient was 
monitored on telemetry with no significant events. She was 
continued on pravastatin 80mg daily, ASA 325mg, and a BB. Plavix 
was started for duration of at least 12months. ACEI was not 
added given that there was no evidence of any systolic 
dysfunction on echo. The patient was advised that she would need 
additional stress testing in ___ weeks to further evaluate 
cardiac status. Given diffuse disease, she may be a candidate 
for CABG in the future.
.
#. Pump: The patient had mild diastolic dysfunction on ___ echo 
in setting of post-MI. There was no systolic dysfunction or wall 
motion abnormality seen on echo. She was discharged on decreased 
dose of lasix (20mg daily), which was initially started for 
history ___ swelling by her PCP. 
.  
#. Rhythm: The patient was in NSR with no acute issues. She was 
continued on metoprolol while inhouse, and was discharged on 
home dose of atenolol upon discharge.
.  
#. Borderline diabetes: The patient had HbA1c of 5.8% with good 
glycemic control with diet-modification. 
.
#. Chronic pain/fibromyalgia: The patient was continued on 
dilaudid prn.
.  
#. RLE pain: The patient was continued on home dose of 
neurontin.
.
#. The patient was discharged on ___ in good condition, VSS, 
ambulating well, CP-free. She was advised to follow-up with her 
cardiologist and PCP shortly after discharge.

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 64-year-old female who presented with an inferior STEMI. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis, chronic pain syndrome, depression, and bilateral cataracts. She has a family history of premature coronary artery disease in her father, who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. 

The patient's allergies include penicillins and ibuprofen. She was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of chest pain and was found to have an 80% stenosis at the bifurcation of the LAD and OM, which was too difficult to stent due to concern for jailing the artery. She also had a 90% lesion to the mid RCA, which was stented with a DES. 

The patient's medications at discharge include ASA, morphine, lopressor, heparin, plavix, and integrallin. Her physical examination was normal, with no signs of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Her laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated troponin and creatine kinase levels. 

The patient's diagnosis is two-vessel coronary artery disease, with successful stenting of the mid-RCA with a Cypher DES. Her echocardiogram showed normal left atrial size, left ventricular wall thickness, and regional/global systolic function, with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who initially presented 
with severe abdominal pain. At that time, no obvious findings on 
CT scan and no obvious leak was appreciated. Given her pain and 
significant CT findings, it was decided that she would benefit 
from a diagnostic laparoscopy. At that time, I was concerned 
that she may actually have a gastric perforation and may have a 
gallbladder issue that could potentially be addressed 
laparoscopically. Thus, we decided to start the case 
laparoscopically with potential conversion to an open procedure 
if a significant
lesion in the stomach was appreciated. The risks and benefits of 
the procedure were described in detail to the patient. Despite 
these risks, she chose to proceed with surgery. She was found to 
have a gastric perforation and therefore converted to 
exploratory laparotomy with ___ patch and placement of a 
Pravena vac. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a IV dialudid 
PCA and then transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone 
once tolerating a diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression and nasojejunal 
tube in place for feeding.  On POD2 tube feeding were started 
through the doboff. On POD3 the NGT was accidently  removed by 
the patient when sneezing. She was kept NPO (except tube feeds). 
On POD5 she underwent upper GI leak test that was unclear and 
therefore was repeated on POD7 and negative for leak. Doboff was 
removed and she was given a regular diet with good tolerability. 
H.Pylori result was positive and therefore she was started on 
quadruple therapy once tolerating a diet. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. H.Pylori quadrupal therapy 
started and prescribed 2 week course. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

SODIUM-127* POTASSIUM-4.2 CHLORIDE-90* TOTAL CO2-27 ANION ___ Chest xray

Cardiomegaly is severe. Heterogeneous opacification throughout 
both lungs, 
accompanied by right pleural effusion is most easily explained 
by pulmonary edema, but other possibilities abound such as drug 
reaction, hemorrhage, or multifocal pneumonia. 
  
The transvenous right atrial pacer lead terminates more medial 
than the 
expected location of the normal right atrial appendage. It could 
be in a 
gigantic right atrium or running through the tricuspid valve 
toward the 
pulmonary outflow tract of the right ventricle. No pneumothorax. 


___ Chest xray

Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. Left 
transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard position. Pulmonary 
edema has improved, now is mild.  
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There are no 
new lung 
abnormalities. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ under the Acute Care Surgery 
Service for management of his RLE hematoma. He was taken to the 
operating room overnight and underwent incision and drainage of 
hematoma with debridement of skin, muscle, and fascia. He 
tolerated the procedure well and was extubated upon completion 
and taken to the PACU for recovery.

Postoperatively, he was transferred to the surgical floor. His 
vital signs were routinely monitored. He remained afebrile with 
a stable heart rate and BP. However, in the evening of POD 0 his 
oxygen saturation was noted to drop into the high 70's on room 
air and he had objective increased work of breathing. A chest 
xray was obtained which showed pulmonary edema and small 
bilateral pleural effusions. The patient was restarted on his 
home dose of Lasix, which had been held initially 
postoperatively for a borderline systolic BP in the 90's. His 
systolic BP remained stable in the 90's-100's with the Lasix. On 
POD1 he continued to have increased work of breathing with 
audible wheezing and inability to wean off supplemental O2 with 
O2 sats in the mid 80's on room air. A repeat chest xray was 
obtained at that time which showed improvement in pulmonary 
edema and stable small bilateral pleural effusions. At the time 
of discharge his O2 sats remained stable in the high 90's on 1.5 
L NC with decreased evidence of pulmonary edema. His oxygen was 
successfully weaned off prior to discharge.

Plastic surgery was consulted for the RLE wound postoperatively, 
who recommended wet to dry dressing changes BID, elevation of 
the RLE, and discussed the possibility of performing a skin 
graft. He will follow up as an outpatient in Plastics clinic for 
further discussions regarding skin grafting.

Physical therapy was consulted as it was noted that the patients 
mobility status had declined since being admitted to the 
hospital. He is being recommended for rehab after his acute 
hospital stay.

ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with a recent admission 
___ ___ for multifocal pneumonia complicated by chronic 
respiratory failure further complicated recurrent PNA x2 at 
rehab s/p trach/PEG, decannulated on ___. She presented for 
this admission with 2 days of dyspnea and productive cough, and 
was found to be hypoxemic requiring high-flow oxygen. CXR showed 
possible pneumonia and completed course of antibiotics 
(Vanc/ceftazidime, Day 1: ___. Her respiratory failure was 
thought to be secondary to recurrent aspiration related to her 
neuromuscular disease. She was given hypertonic saline nebs, 
guaiafenesin, Duonebs, pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve. She 
required intubation, and was unable to be weaned off the 
ventilator. After numerous goals of care discussions with the 
ICU team, her outpatient pulmonologist, palliative care, and her 
family, decision was made to undergo trach/PEG on ___. She 
tolerated this well, and was able to be weaned off the 
ventilator by ___, when she was transferred to floor. Cuff 
pressures were high, but patient had been tolerating this well. 
She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES
-- NEW: senna PRN and Colace PRN constipation
-- HELD: loperamide (as noted above, consider low dose trial if 
she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools. 
[ ] Continue to discuss goals of care with patient  
[ ] Patient will follow up with the interventional 
pulmonologists for further monitoring of her tracheostomy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has allergies to penicillins and oxybutynin. The patient's chief complaint was hypoxia, dyspnea, productive cough, and congestion, which she experienced for the past two days. She was previously intubated and had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was referred to the emergency department for stoma closure and was found to have tachypnea, rhonchorous lungs, and a stoma site. The patient was given various medications, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and cefepime. She was also given oxygen therapy and had a flutter valve inserted. The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, and normal abdominal examination. The patient's laboratory results showed anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Imaging studies revealed extensive atelectasis in the lower lungs, which could not exclude a superimposed pneumonia. The patient was discharged with a tracheostomy mask and speaking valve, and was advised to use a flutter valve and oxygen therapy. ||endoftext||"

Pertinent Results:
ARTERIOGRAMS: 
  
FINDINGS:  
Right common carotid artery:  Was well visualized and was of 
mild tortuosity.  The anterior intracranial circulation is well 
visualized.  The distal internal carotid arteries well 
visualized the peak stress, lacerum, cavernous, clinoid, 
ophthalmic, and communicating segments do not show any 
abnormalities.  A infundibulum is associated with a small 
posterior communicating artery.  The middle cerebral artery is 
well visualized as is bifurcation.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
are identified.  The anterior cerebral artery is well 
visualized.  The anterior communicating artery is also well 
visualized and appears to have 2 infundibuli, from which 2 small 
vessels can be seen emerging, this is best appreciated on the 
three-dimensional reconstructions.  No aneurysmal abnormalities 
were detected.  An early draining veins or intracranial to 
extracranial shunting can be identified. 
  
Left common carotid artery:  Was well visualized was of small 
tortuosity.  The anterior intracranial circulation well 
visualized.  The distal internal carotid artery was well 
visualized, the peak stress, lacerum, cavernous, clinoid, 
ophthalmic, and communicating segments did not show any 
abnormalities.  E termination is normal.  The middle cerebral 
artery is well visualized as is bifurcation and does not show 
any aneurysmal abnormalities.  The anterior cerebral artery is 
well visualized not show any abnormalities.  The anterior 
communicating artery is again noted.  And again the infundibula 
are noted with the small vessels imaging from the tip.  Again 
this is best appreciated on the three-dimensional rotational 
angiography reconstructions.  No aneurysmal abnormalities are 
detected.  Note early draining veins or intracranial to 
extracranial shunting identified. 
  
  
Left vertebral artery:  Is well visualized and is of small 
tortuosity.  
Bilaterally the posterior cerebral arteries, superior cerebellar 
arteries and anterior inferior cerebellar arteries are well 
visualized bilaterally and did not reveal any aneurysmal

bilaterally can also be identified not show any abnormalities.  
The basilar artery itself does not show any irregularities are 
abnormalities within normal AP X.  The distal portion of the 
right vertebral artery can be seen second route of reflux and 
does not show any abnormalities.  No early draining veins or 
intracranial to extracranial shunting was identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with complicated past medical history 
including CVA s/p hemicraniectomy, TAC with end ileostomy 
(History of crohns), recent admission to ___ on ___ with 
SBO for which she underwent exlap, LOA, reduction of internal 
hernia c/b abdominal wall soft tissue necrosis/infection 
followed failed abdominal graft (___) who presented from 
___ rehab for G-tube replacement, found to have 
hyperglycemia, ___, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic 
acidosis. She was admitted to the FICU for closer monitoring 
with improvement in her AGMA, resulting in transfer to medicine 
service. Ultimately the end of her hospitalization involved 
adjustments of her insulin and tube feeding regimen in order to 
obtain adequate glycemic control. 

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis
# Respiratory acidosis
# Lactic acidosis
Patient presented with elevated lactate and AGMA. The suspect 
etiology was hypovolemia with improvement in lactate after 4L 
IVF. There was brief increase in lactate to 5 while in ICU but 
this was felt to be a spurious value with improvement after 1L 
of IVF. No evidence of ketones in urine to suggest DKA despite 
elevated glucose on presentation. Patient remained normotensive 
in FICU with improvement in AGMA and downtrend in lactate. Given 
stability, she was transferred to medicine service.  She 
remained stable during her stay. Anion gap closed. 

# G-tube
# Nutrition
G-tube dislodged at outside facility. Surrounding erythema and 
tenderness. Plastic surgery and wound consult evaluated the site 
and were not concerned by its appearance. ___ was consulted for 
G-tube replacement and the existing tube was put back in place.  
Her tube feeds were restarted and advanced to goal.  She was 
able to tolerate a full regular diet before discharge, but not 
quite at goal in terms of nutrition. As such her tube feeds are 
currently running continuous, and as a result her insulin 
regimen, outlined below, needed titration. Initially she was 
also placed on a pureed solid/thin liquid diet however this was 
advanced to soft solids/thin liquids before discharge. Once able 
to take sufficient PO intake, her tube feeds may be changed to 
Glucerna 1.2 @ 60 mL/hr x12hours w/ Juven TID ___ kcal, 50 g 
protein, 1590 mL free water), with monitoring of sodium and 
hydration status; adjust flushes prn. Her insulin will also need 
titration as her tube feeds are adjusted. 

# Concern for aspiration
Several days ago was found to have food in her mouth. SLP 
recommending pureed solids with thin liquids, Meds crushed in 
applesauce via tube, 1:1 feeds. Patient very unhappy with this 
change, SLP re-evaluated and recommended soft solids with thin 
liquids. Hopefully this will help with augmentation of her PO 
intake. 

# Diabetes with hyperglycemia
Glucose in the 500s on presentation. Started on insulin drip in 
ED, transitioned to SC. No ketones on UA, Beta-OH wnl.  She was 
given her home glargine and sliding scale insulin, but had blood 
sugar 300s.  ___ was consulted and increased her home Lantus 
and Humalog. Ultimately, likely due to continuous tube feeding 
rather than cycled, her insulin requirements went up 
significantly. At the time of discharge she is requiring the 
following: 
-lantus 70 units BID
-Humalog q4hrs with scale: 
71-100: 0 units
101-150: 12 units
151-200: 17 units
201-250: 22 units
251-300: 27 units
301-350: 32 units
351-400: 37 units
>400: 42 units
Her sugars have been running in the high 200-low 300s by the 
time of discharge (significantly improved). Anticipate that as 
her PO feeds pick up and tube feeds become night time 
only/cycled, she could go back to her home insulin regimen 
(lantus 50 units BID, Humalog 16 units TIDWM). For now, she will 
need q4hrs Humalog until continuous tube feeds are 
stopped/tapered off.  

# Pyuria
# Urinary tract infection: Endorsed dysuria on admission.  UA 
was positive, but urine culture was negative.  Empiric 
ceftriaxone was started and stopped.

# Abdominal wound
# Abdominal pain
Patient presented with abdominal pain. Exam notable for 
significant erythema surrounding ileostomy site and abdominal 
wound. CT scan without evidence for abdominal pain. At this 
point, suspect that her abdominal pain is related to the skin 
erythema.  Plastic surgery and wound care were consulted and 
provided recommendations for wound care. 

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis recently. Possibly related to hepatic 
infarction (infarction vs geographic fat on CT), but ultrasound 
shows main and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal 
flow. Hepatitis B and C serologies were sent and were negative. 
Plan was to continue to trend LFTs. 

# Acute kidney injury: Likely pre-renal. Improved with IV 
fluids.

# Hypercalcemia: Suspect related to dehydration and immobility. 
Improved with IV fluids. Ca2+ 10.7 on the day of discharge, will 
need monitoring periodically with tube feeding. 

# Hypertension: amlodipine and metoprolol were initially held 
while she was critically ill and as she remained normotensive 
these were not resumed. If/when BP starts to trend up, would 
resume these. HR around the ___, so could consider Metoprolol 
first, but might consider starting at lower doses than she had 
been on before. 

# h/o CVA w/ residual asphasia and right hemiplegia: patient was 
continued on her home baclofen, gabapentin, and lidocaine patch

# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: patient was given 
duonebs and albuterol prn

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin

# Depression: continued amitriptyline

# Transaminitis
Mild transaminitis recently. Possibly related to hepatic 
infarction (infarction vs geographic fat on CT), but ultrasound 
shows main and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal 
flow.
- hepatitis serologies negative
- abdominal exam benign 
- outpatient follow up 
- LFTs trended down slightly before discharge, will need repeats 
in ___ weeks to ensure stable/trending down 

TRANSITIONS OF CARE
-------------------
# Follow-up: patient will return to rehab and will need 
continued diabetic management. As tube feeding can be 
de-escalated to qhs, insulin regimen should be titrated as well. 
Would suggest close electrolyte monitoring during this 
transition. Ca2+ elevated at 10.7 at the time of discharge, but 
___ resolved by the time of discharge. 
Would also repeat LFTs in ___ weeks as they were mildly 
elevated. 

Time spent: 55 minutes

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent 
hospitalization.  You came to the hospital with a dislodged 
gastric tube.  This was put back in place, and your tube feeds 
were restarted.  You are now being discharged. Your insulin 
regimen was adjusted due to persistently elevated blood sugars 
in the hospital. As you begin to eat more orally, your tube 
feeding regimen can be scaled back to night time only as it had 
been before, and we anticipate your insulin dose will also be 
able to decrease. Since you aren't eating much as of now, we 
recommend keeping your insulin doses higher for now. 

It is important that you continue to take your medications as 
prescribed and follow up with the medical team at your facility 
for further care.

We wish you the best. 

Sincerely, 
Your care team at ___ 

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for G-tube replacement. She has a complicated past medical history, including a stroke with residual deficits, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and a total colectomy with ileostomy. She was recently readmitted from another hospital for a small bowel obstruction and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, left ostomy, and reduction of internal hernia, but unfortunately, the abdominal graft failed.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient complained of abdominal pain around her ileostomy site and PEG tube site, as well as burning with urination. She was found to have hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and lactic acidosis, with concern for intraabdominal infection. She was started on insulin and antibiotics, and a CT abdomen showed nonspecific areas of low attenuation in the liver, which may be due to hepatic infarction or geographic fat.

The patient underwent several procedures, including G-tube placement and replacement, and was prescribed several medications, including insulin, antibiotics, and pain medication. She was also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was treated with antibiotics.

The patient's physical exam revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness around the PEG tube site and ileostomy site, as well as a left thigh skin wound. Her neurological exam showed residual deficits from her stroke, including right-sided hemiplegia. ||endoftext||"

Surgery
 You underwent surgery to remove a brain lesion from your brain 

 Please keep your incision dry until your sutures are removed. 
 You may shower at this time but keep your incision dry.
 It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
 Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
 We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, 
or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment.
 You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your 
activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. 
___ try to do too much all at once.
 No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
 If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 
 No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
 Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
 You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam). This 
medication helps to prevent seizures. Please continue this 
medication as indicated on your discharge instructions. It is

MICROBIOLOGY
___ MRSA SCREEN: No MRSA isolated
.
IMAGING
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is bilateral diffuse 
reticulonodular opacity in the lower lung fields and 
ground-glass haziness. These findings are compatible with 
pulmonary edema. Dialysis catheter is in unchanged position with 
tip seen in the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. Cluster of 
calcifications in the right mid lung are unchanged. The aorta is 
tortuous and calcified. There is mild cardiomegaly. No definite 
pleural effusions are seen.
.
___ TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
inferior akinesis and near akinesis of the distal half of the 
septum and anterior walls. The apex is aneurysmal and akinetic. 
The remaining segments contract well (LVEF 30%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image 
quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w 
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased 
and global left ventricular systolic function is improved with 
slight decrease in cavity size. Regional left ventricular 
dysfunction is similar.
.
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison with the study of 
___, there has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary 
vascular congestion with the pulmonary vessels now only mildly 
engorged. Minimal atelectatic change is seen at the left base 
and there may be blunting of the costophrenic angle. 
Hemodialysis catheter remains in place.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F w/ CAD s/p MI (in ___ and previous 2 stents in RCA and 
LAD, scleroderma, HTN, ESRD on HD s/p transplant x2, and 
systolic HF (EF ___ who comes in with chronic burning chest 
pain and acute systolic heart failure.
.  
# Acute Systolic CHF: Patient presented with increased dyspnea 
and chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema. Physical exam 
demonstrated rales to mid lung fields. Patient reports increased 
dyspnea prior to dialysis recently and may need change to dry 
weight. She had a session of ultrafiltration the night of 
admission and then a truncated 2-hour session of dialysis the 
following day. In keeping with her outpatient schedule, the pt 
went for a full session of dialysis on ___. ECHO showed an 
EF of 30% and so she was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg 
qHS, with lisinopril 2.5mg to possibly be started as an 
outpatient (and to be titrated up as her blood pressure will 
tolerate it and also to be held on her dialysis days). After her 
dialysis session, pt's symptoms improved, physical exam 
demonstrated clear lung fields, and chest xray showed interval 
improvement in pulmonary edema. 
.
#. Chest Pain/Burning: Pts pain was atypical. Her symptom has 
bothered her each evening for a very long time, and is 
exacerbated when she lies on her back. It is thought to be GI 
related per outpatient providers and will follow up with GI in 
one week. EKG was without changes, and discomfort resolved on 
arrival and with subsequent nitroglycerin. Her cardiac enzymes 
were trended until they peaked. She was put on PPI and carafate, 
which seemed to provide relief of her pain. 
. 
#. ESRD sp transplant on HD: Pt had a session of ultrafiltration 
on the night of admission and was continued on her outpatient 
schedule of dialysis, ___. Her graft is 
well-functioning and her tunneled catheter was pulled. She was 
continued on her home prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus, and 
calcitriol. Her tacrolimus levels were within target. The amount 
of fluid they were able to take off and the length of time spent 
on dialysis was limited by pt's low blood pressure. She will 
continue to have 4 hours of dialysis, three times a week, with 
the next session on ___ and an estimated dry weight of 
67.5kg. 
.   
# CAD: Pt was continued on her home statin and ASA. 
.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was in sinus rhythm, and had no active issues with 
her rhythm during the admission. She was monitored on telemetry
.
#. Normocytic Anemia: At recent baseline. Secondary to ESRD. She 
was continued on Aranesp with dialysis per her outpatient 
regimen and given 1 unit pRBC with an appropriate increase in 
her hematocrit.
.   
# HTN: Blood pressure was well controlled on presentation. She 
was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg qHS, with lisinopril to 
possibly be started as an outpatient as long as her blood 
pressure can tolerate it. Her lisinopril should be held on 
hemodialysis days due to low blood pressures.
.  
# HLD: Pt was continued on her home Lipitor.    
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Recommend initiating lisinopril 2.5mg daily as an outpatient 
as long as her blood pressures can tolerate it. This medication 
should be held on hemodialysis days.
STOP taking calcitriol
START nephrocaps as a vitamin for your kidneys
START pantoprazole twice daily for your heartburn
START carafate up to four times per day for your heartburn, do 
not take this within 1 hour of your other medications
START taking Maalox (calcium and simethicone) as needed for your 
heartburn

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 57-year-old female who was admitted with burning chest pain and shortness of breath. She has a history of coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction and stenting, as well as scleroderma, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She was previously a renal transplant recipient, but her current transplant is failing. She was admitted to the hospital with pulmonary edema and dyspnea, and was intubated for respiratory distress. She was started on dialysis and was treated with lasix, which provided relief from her symptoms. She was also prescribed furosemide and omeprazole.

The patient's diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the report, but it appears that she has chronic kidney disease, pulmonary edema, and possibly gastrointestinal issues contributing to her chest pain. She underwent a removal of a tunneled dialysis catheter and was started on CPAP in the emergency department.

At discharge, the patient's medications included furosemide, omeprazole, and possibly other medications not specified in the report. Her physical exam was notable for mild respiratory distress, but she was otherwise stable and comfortable while sitting upright with oxygen. ||endoftext||"

Imaging:
___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.

___ TTE
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed 
(LVEF= ___ %) with akinesis of the basal to mid inferior and 
inferolateral walls and global hypokinesis of the remaining 
segments. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity size and systolic 
function are normal. The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no 
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is 
likely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic 
regurgitation. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased. The other 
findings are similar.  

___ TEE
The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or 
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial 
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. Right atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricle is not well 
seen. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild 
to moderate (___) central aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) central mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No ___ SEC or thrombus. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted due to worsening fatigue. After some testing, 
it was determined that this was due to worsening of your atrial 
fibrillation. For that reason, we treated you with a 
cardioversion to get you back into a normal sinus rhythm. We 
also started a medication called amiodarone to help keep you in 
a normal rhythm. It will be important to follow up with your 
cardiologist for management of this medication. We also 
decreased your metoprolol to 50mg, stopped your digoxin, and 
decreased your simvastatin to 20mg. We decreased your lasix to 
40mg per day. Please stop taking your glipizide and lisinopril 
until you see your primary care doctor to ensure you kidney 
function is ok. It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Best of luck,
Your ___ medical team
 
Followup Instructions:

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of fatigue. He has a history of coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has also had recurrent deep vein thrombosis and has been on warfarin. His past medical history is significant for a previous myocardial infarction, stent placement, and cardiac catheterization. He has been experiencing worsening fatigue and was admitted to the hospital for diuresis.

The patient's physical exam revealed mild jugular venous distension, bilateral lower extremity edema, and bibasilar crackles. His laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and creatinine levels. His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed atrial fibrillation and normal axis.

The patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. He was started on digoxin and furosemide during his hospital stay.

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and his physical exam revealed no acute distress. He was prescribed medications including aspirin, digoxin, and furosemide. His laboratory results showed improvement in his troponin and BNP levels, and his creatinine level was stable. ||endoftext||"

Blood Cultures routine and mycolytic NGTD at time of D/C

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended ensure supplementation, 
but pt. did not like ensure and made this clear to nutrition, 
ensure was seen unopened on pt.s tray every morning.
.
#Diarrhea: Likely ___ OI, differential is quite wide: crypto, 
giardia, ___, CMV, C. diff. All previous wkup 
was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the neuroscience step-down unit on 
the day of admission, ___. She continued on Dexamethasone 
4mg IV QH and Keppra 1,000mg PO BID. A head CTA and CT torso was 
ordered. Radiation oncology and neuro-oncology were consulted. 

The CT of the Torso was negative for any malignancy; an 8mm 
thyroid nodule was noted that will require an US on an 
outpatient basis.

On ___, the patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of the 
right temporal brain mass, which went well without complication. 
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient 
underwent a postoperative CT scan, which revealed no active 
bleeding. Afterwards, the patient was transferred to the floor 
where she remained stable overnight into ___. On ___ she 
udnerwent a WAND study in anticipation of going to the OR on 
___ for resection. 

On ___ she went to the operating room for a right temporal 
craniectomy for resection of intracranial lesion. She toelrated 
the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room, and 
transferred to the ICU post-operatively for observation and 
care. Post op CT scan showed no signs of bleed.  In the evening 
the patient had afib with RVR with HRs up to the 140s.  The 
patient was converted back to NSR overnight after going on a 
dilt drip. 

On ___ the patient continued to progress well in the ICU.  A 
cardiology consult was placed for the afib which recommended an 
echocardiogram, TSH, and starting her on metoprolol 12.5mg BID.  
These recommendations were followed. Her afib subsequently 
resolved. The MRI showed postsurgical changes along the right 
temporal lobe without evidence of residual nodular enhancement.  
Residual FLAIR signal hyperintensity along the medial temporal 
lobe with a new area of abnormal FLAIR posterior and lateral to 
surgical cavity with associated slow diffusion which could be 
related to postsurgical changes or ischemia. The echocardiogram 
was within normal limits. TSH level was normal (0.93).

On ___, the patient was transferred to the floor, and her diet 
was advanced as tolerated. She started to work with physical 
therapy.

___, the patient contintued to progress well on the floor.  
Physical therapy worked with her and fel that she was limited by 
lethargy, and once resolved,
would improve rapidly. Physical therapy felt the patient would 
benefit from another day of physical therapy on an inpatient 
basis. She will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient, but 
should remain on metoprolol. 

On ___, patient was re-evaluated by ___ and determined that she 
needed an additional day to work on stairs. On ___, patient

intrathoracic
findings.

Pleural fluid ___
DIAGNOSIS:
PLEURAL FLUID, LATERALITY NOT SPECIFIED:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Upper Extremity US ___
The left subclavian vein inferior to the clavicle cannot be 
evaluated due to
bandaging.  There is no evidence of thrombosis in the 
supraclavicular portion
of the left subclavian vein.  Otherwise, no evidence of deep 
vein thrombosis
in the left upper extremity.

CXR ___
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with subjacent 
atelectasis
and/or consolidation as well as mild but unchanged pulmonary 
edema.

CT Chest w/ contrast ___. Compared to 2 weeks prior, scattered ground-glass opacities 
most prominent
in the paramediastinal parenchyma and lower lobes has improved, 
probably
improved edema.
2. Heterogeneous right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged since 
at least
___, probably chronic collapse, though superimposed 
infection cannot
be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
3. Scattered metastatic pulmonary nodules are unchanged.  
Somewhat nodular
interlobular septal thickening persists at the right lung base, 
concerning for
lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
4. A small left pleural effusion is slightly decreased.  A 
loculated right
pleural effusion with associated pleural enhancement concerning 
for malignant
pleural involvement is unchanged.
5. Hepatic lesions have significantly increased in size since 2 
weeks prior.
6. Right breast and axillary soft tissue are unchanged.  
Scattered osseous
metastases are unchanged.
7. A 2 cm enhancing right thyroid nodule is unchanged.  If/when 
clinically
indicated, this could be further assessed with ultrasound.

___ Upper GI swallow:
Study is markedly limited by patient's inability to assume 
procedural 
positions needed for adequate image acquisition and patient's 
inability to 
drink thin barium. 
Within the limitations of this study, there was free passage of 
contrast from 
oropharynx, through the esophagus, into the stomach.  However 
there was 
contrast pooling within the distal stomach without visualization 
of contrast 
passage into the duodenum. 

___ CXR:
Right-sided pleural effusion, similar to the prior radiographs.  
The tip of 
the enteric catheter does not lie within the majority of the 
fluid, as seen on 
recent CT. 

___ CXR:
Mild interstitial edema has developed since ___. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is still engorged, moderate right and 
small left 
pleural effusion stable, moderate enlargement of cardiac 
silhouette unchanged. 
No pneumothorax. 
  
Left central venous infusion port ends in the low SVC.  Right 
basal pleural 
drainage catheter unchanged in position.  T AVR noted. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=====================
___ year old woman with stage IV ER/PR+/HER2- breast cancer (on 
C1D12 of paclitaxel), malignant pleural effusion s/p R TPC (___), PE on rivaroxaban, dCHF, AS s/p TAVR, mitral stenosis 
presented with cough, dyspnea and diarrhea. She was found to 
have Cdiff infection and pneumonia, and was started on 
antiobiotic treatment. She was initially transferred to ICU due 
to low blood pressure and concern for sepsis. She was shortly 
kept on pressors, but upon communication with primary 
oncologist, it was found that her pressures normally run very 
low. Patient was transferred to the floor but then she quickly 
returned to the FICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. This 
was felt to be related to flash pulmonary edema. She was 
diuresed with IV Lasix 20mg and was started on BiPAP. She was 
weaned off BiPAP after diuresis and received further diuresis 
with improvement in respiratory status. BPs remained stable. She 
was continued on cefepime for treatment of HAP and was continued 
on po vancomycin for c. difficile colitis until ___ when she 
completed her course. On the floor she remained stable on ___ 
O2 requirements, which were weaned down to 0.5L with her 
diuresis which also were tapered to Lasix 40mg PO daily. Her 
blood pressures continued to fluctuate into low realms, however, 
improved in inverse reflection of her diuretic taper to levels 
where she able to undergo extensive in house ___ and become 
re-conditioned physically.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
#Sespis: Patient presented with tachypnea to 33, leukocytosis, 
and potential respiratory vs. abdominal source given symptoms. 
She was given 3L IVF in ED. She was started on treatment for HAP 
with vancomycin and cefepime. Was also found to be positive for 
C. diff, and was started on PO vancomycin in the ICU. Blood 
pressure initially required support with levophed which was 
weaned off in ICU within 1 day of admission after contact with 
primary oncologist confirmed that her baseline BPs run in the 
mid ___. Patient was subsequently transferred to medical floor, 
however returned quickly to ___ due to hypoxemic respiratory 
failure (see below).

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Malignant pleural effusion: 
Causes for her acute worsening dyspnea and hypoxia on the floor 
was believed to be flash pulmonary edema. Possible triggers 
included HTN (SBP 158 - baseline 80-90s), decompensated HF (BNP 
900s from 400s), tachycardia (120s from baseline 100s), 
worsening pleural effusion (150 cc drained ___, Trop and EKG 
without evidence of ischemia. She has stabilized with 20 mg IV 
Lasix, duoneb and BiPAP, transferred back to the floor. Pleurx 
was also frequently drained which helped improved hypoxia. 
Diuresis was continued on the floor however patient continued to 
have blood pressures on low ___, prompting taper of diuresis to 
40mg Lasix PO daily which reflected improvement in her BP, 
albeit it lingers below average. Pleurx was capped with plan for 
patient to continue two to three-times-per-week drainage on 
M(W)F and remove fluid as needed for comfort.

#Orthostatic hypotension: Likely related to volume status in the 
setting of ongoing diuresis, with possible contribution from 
olanzapine medication side effect. Improved w/ further ___ 
conditioning. Continued PO Lasix 40 daily, decreased from BID 
and TID earlier this admission. Continued ___ rehabilitation 
during admission and cleared for home. Continued olanzapine at 
decreased dose of 5mg qHS.

#Nausea/Vomiting: Attempted various permutations of medications 
but ultimately succeeded with suppression via pre-meal 
medication with Reglan, increased to appropriate dose. Continued 
on Caphosol for dry mouth, olanzapine 5mg QHS, Zofran PRN 
breakthrough (avoided standing as pt has developed tachyphylaxis 
in the past), and EKG q3d for QTc monitoring which have been 
unremarkable.

#Hospital acquired pneumonia: Presented with dyspnea, cough, 
presence of effusion and ?opacity on admission which was 
concerning for pneumonia. Initiated on vanc/cefepime on ___ 
for presumed HAP given recent hospitalization. Completed 
cefepime (___). Received vancomycin briefly (___) 
until MRSA swab was found to be negative. Cough was managed with 
Sodium Chloride 3% Inhalation Soln 15 mL NEB Q6H.

#HFpEF
#Mitral stenosis: likely due to mitral annular calcification 
with intermittent pulmonary edema during chemotherapy. Last ECHO 
on ___ demonstrated LVEF >55%, severe functional mitral 
stenosis, well seated aortic valve prosthesis. Notably, her 
tumor has shown signs of progression in her liver and lungs 
despite chemotherapy with 5 agents. Per Dr ___ (___) 
the risks of TMVR given her progressive metastatic disease are 
very high. Upon discharge, the patient will follow-up with Dr 
___ scheduling of a cardiac CT to reassess her risks and 
potential TMVR intervention. Lasix was 40mg PO daily at 
discharge, with discharge weight of 43.59kg 96.1lbs 

#Metastatic Breast Cancer: Patient originally on C1 of 
Paclitaxel, after failing multiple chemo regimens. Found to have 
metastatic pulmonary nodules and lymphangitic spread likely 
contributing to her hypoxia. Patient's further chemotherapy 
regimen was determined by her outpatient oncologist and fellow 
in-house given her length-of-stay and was started on eribulin in 
house ___, and second dose ___. Her CBC w/ diff has 
been followed during this therapy. Discontinued superfluous 
medications as ASA, atorvastatin, and decreased 
hydroxychloroquine to 200mg daily given weight changes. She will 
have follow up in outpatient ___ clinic for continuation of 
treatment. 

#C. Diff colitis: Patient presented with hypotension with 
initial possible sources including PNA was later found to have 
c. diff colitis. Patient was able to be weaned off of pressors 
after discovery that her baseline blood pressures are in the 
___. Patient was initiated on PO Vancomycin which she continued 
until ___. Per oncology floor policy, remained on precautions 
following the conclusion of her treatment.

#Macrocytic anemia: Hgb ~10 from baseline ~11, possibly in 
setting of fluid resuscitation vs. recent chemotherapy. Anemia 
remained stable.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
================= 
#?COPD: Wheezing on presentation. Smoking history. Continued 
nebs prn 
#Prior DVT/PE ___: Continued rivaroxaban
#AS: s/p TAVR
#HLD: Continued ASA/Atorvastatin, discontinued on discharge as 
above. 
#Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___!

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED?
You were admitted because he were found to have weakness and 
hypotension by your ___.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?
You were initially started on antibiotics for a presumed 
infection.  You also received fluids in order to raise your 
blood pressure.  Your infectious workup showed that you have an 
infection with C. difficile, as well as a pneumonia.  For this 
you were started on oral vancomycin which you took until ___. For your pneumonia you completed a 7 day course with 
cefepime.
You were also found to have increased oxygen requirements due in 
part to increased fluid accumulation around your lung.  This 
fluid was drained through your Pleurx and this helped improved 
your oxygen requirements. 
You had a short course in the ICU for management of your oxygen 
requirements, where you received diuresis (to remove the fluid 
from your lungs) and a BiPAP machine (to improve your 
breathing). 
After your stay in the ICU, you were transferred to a regular 
oncology floor where you remained stable on ___ Oxygen, however 
your blood pressures continued to be low. Due to this reason we 
had to stop your water pills temporarily but then we restarted 
them again since your fluid status was difficult to control.
You were weaned down to a dose of one water pill per day to 
maximize treatment of your shortness of breath while allowing 
you to hold your blood pressure and work with physical therapy. 
You continued to work with physical therapy in the hospital 
until you were re-conditioned to be able to work with your 
family at home to get stronger.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AT HOME?
You need to continued taking your medications as prescribed and 
follow-up with the appointments scheduled for you.
 
You should have your pleurx drained ___ times a week (M(W)F). 
You can take out as much fluid as you can until you start 
feeling uncomfortable.

Thank you for allowing us be involved in your care, we wish you 
all the best!

Your ___ Team

who presents with cough and shortness of breath
.  
#  Cough- Patient was recently admitted with similar symptoms at 
___ and was discharged with a course of augmentin and 
doxycycline for CAP, which she completed.  However, prior to 
admission, she developed cough associated with shortness of 
breath so she presented to ___.   In the ED, she was febrile 
with possible early pneumonia on CXR, so she received a dose of 
ceftriaxone.  Given that her WBC was normal, and cough was 
non-productive, the patient was not initially treated for HCAP.  
In addition, she has presented like this in the past and was 
treated for a COPD exacerbation.  On admission, she was started 
on azithromycin, prednisone 60mg daily and nebulizers.  Her 
symptoms improved and oxygen requirement was decreasing.  
However, she developed a fever on ___ so she was started on 
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, given recent hospital 
discharge.  She was weaned off oxygen and worked well with 
physical therapy.  Urine legionella was negative.  Blood and 
urine cultures were negative.  Sputum culture was contaminated 
with normal respiratory flora.  The patient completed an 8 day 
course of antibiotics- vancomycin 1gm q48hours, Cefepime 1g q24 
hours via ___ line.  She is being discharged on a prednisone 
taper starting at 30mg daily.  On discharge, cough, shortness of 
breath and oxygen requirement had resolved.  She was able to 
ambulate with no shortness of breath.  The patient was afebrile 
from ___ until discharge, had a normal WBC count and looked 
well.  
.  
#  Fever- Likely secondary to pneumonia.  She lacked other 
symptoms of influenza (myalgias, etc).  Patient's cultures were 
negative.  UA was negative for UTI.  
.
#  COPD- Patient improved with azithromycin, nebulizers and 
steroids.  She was weaned off oxygen and is being discharged on 
a prednisone taper, starting at 30mg daily for 14 additional 
days of therapy
.  
#  Atrial fibrillation- Continued home amiodarone and 
metoprolol.  Heart rate was regular and was well-controlled.  
Her INR trended up to 4.3 so she was cut down from 2mg 3x/week 
to 0.5 or 1.0mg daily (pending INR) given that she is on 
antibiotics and amiodarone.  As mentioned, her INR peaked at 4.3 
but then trended down.  We resumed her at 2mg daily on ___ 
when INR was 1.7.  Subsequent trend was 1.7 -> 1.5 -> 1.6.  She 
received 2mg of coumadin on ___.  We have 
instructed her to resume her prior regimen on discharge meaning 
she will take 2mg on ___ and 1mg on ___.  We also asked the 
patient to have an INR check on ___ and to please fax the 
results to her PCP for instruction on management of coumadin 
dosing.  
.  
#  Diastolic CHF- The patient has a known history of chronic 
diastolic heart failure.  On admission, there were no signs of 
fluid overload on exam.  Her oxygen requirement was attributed 
to pneumonia and COPD exerbation.  Given her elevated creatinine 
on admission, her lasix and lisinopril were initially held.  Her 
creatinine improved so we resumed her lisinopril at 20mg daily.  
By discharge, we resumed home dose of lisinopril.  Once 
creatinine stabilized, home dose of lasix was resumed and 
patient's creatinine remained stable.  She was discharged on 
home dose of lasix 20mg daily and has ___ with Dr. ___ 
on ___.
.
#  CAD- The patient did not present with chest pain.  Her EKGs 
were consistent with prior.  She was continued on her home 
statin and beta-blocker.  
.
#  Hypertension- As mentioned above, her lisinopril was 
initially held given ___ but was resumed at home dose by 
discharge.  She was continued on the remainder of her home 
medications- imdur 30mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg daily.  BP's were remained stable. 
.
#  Numbness- On the last day of admission, patient revealed to 
us that she had been experiencing numbness in her fingertips 
(all of them).  Exam did not demonstrate any sensory or motor 
deficit as patient has ___ strength in all 4 extremities with 
intact sensation bilaterally.  She is not a diabetic.  Other 
possible etiologies include b12 deficiency, radiculopathy, or 
vasculitis.  Given that her symptoms are in both hands with only 
the DIP joint affected, a cervical radiculopathy is unlikely.  
She has no other systemic symptoms suggestive of vasculitis 
(skin changes, fever, chills) and her labwork is benign.  No 
indication for imaging as remainder of neurological exam is 
intact, including gait.  This also could be due to a medication 
as she received IV antibiotics.  B12 level checked and pending 
at the time of discharge, but, given description of symptoms, 
will likely not be the etiology behind this numbness.  We ask 
that the patient's PCP ___ on this issue when she sees the 
patient on ___.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs. ___ you were admitted on ___ and underwent an 
uncomplicated left sided below the knee amputation. However, 
given the nature of the procedure, you will be discharged to 
rehab and will rehabilitate. 

Here are your discharge instructions:

ACTIVITY:
 On the side of your amputation you are non-weight bearing on 
left side for ___ weeks
 You should keep this amputation site elevated whenever 
possible
 You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots
 No driving until cleared by your surgeon
 No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks
 
BATHING/SHOWERING:
 You may shower when you get home
 No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from 
your date of surgery
 
WOUND CARE:
 Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If 
they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for 
staple removal.
 When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place 
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will 
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these 
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm 
water and soap in the shower.

dietary restrictions as before
 
CALL THE OFFICE at ___  FOR:
 Bleeding, redness of, or drainage from your foot wound
