Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery 
service with acute cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation) and 
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder 
removed laparoscopically.  This procedure went well.  Your pain 
is better controlled and you are now tolerating a regular diet. 

The Psychiatry service met with you given your thoughts of 
self-harm, and have recommended that you be discharged to a 
Psychiatric facility for further mental health care.  

You are now medically cleared to be discharged from the 
hospital. Please note the following discharge instructions:

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours

ECHO: ___
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30%) secondary to 
akinesis of the entire inferior wall, inferior septum, and 
dyskinesis of the basal infero-lateral wall. The apex, distal 
anterior and anteroseptal walls contract best. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The number 
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-severe regional and global systolic 
dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild global right ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild dilatation of the 
aortic root.  

CXR: ___
IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with unknown PMH presented s/p cardiac arrest, with 
diffuse coronary disease s/p DES to OM1, transferred to ICU 
intubated.

#. Cardiac Arrest: s/p cardiac arrest likely scarring causing 
ventricular arrhythmia. Not felt to be due to acute ischemia.  
Now rewarmed and extubated. Unclear etiology of VT, will be seen 
by EP regarding need for ICD as well as cardiac MRI to evaluate 
for scar which may have contributed.

#Fever: patient spiking while on warming protocol requiring cool 
water to slow warming process, likely in setting of infection.  
Patient has been cultured when he spikes. Possibly related to 
GPC in respiratory cx, however had witnessed aspiration event. 
Initially on vanc/zosyn/flagyl, however transitioned on day 5 to 
levofloxacin po, to complete total 8-day course

# CAD: Severe 2 vessel disease, 60% in mid and distal LAD; 
Chronic total of mid-distal L cx; ___ occlusion of OM1; L 
dominant; RCA small and totally occluded; Distal ___ likely 
old; OM1 also difficult, likely old. Fixed OM1 w/ DES. Unclear 
if this was STEMI. More likely arrhythmia secondary to severe 
CAD and scarring. Lipid panel okay. A1C 5.8%.
- continue aspirin
- continue ticagrelor 90 BID
- continue atorvastatin 80 daily 
- start metoprolol 25mg  TID
- start low dose lisinopril

# Respiratory Failure: Resolved. S/P cardiac arrest and 
intubated. Had an episode of aspiration.  Will treat for 
aspiration pneumonia with oral course levoflox.

# Acute congestive heart failure: ECHO showing LV systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30%) secondary to 
akinesis of the entire inferior wall, inferior septum, and 
dyskinesis of the basal infero-lateral wall.

#. Depression
- consider re-starting mirtazepine, sertraline and buproprion 
slowly as an outpatient

#. Hypothyroid: TSH WNL.
- continue levothyroxine

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted this hospitalization following a cardiac 
arrest. You underwent a cooling of your body temperature to help 
decrease any negative effects on the brain following cardiac 
arrest. The likely cause of your arrest is an arrythmia as a 
result of scarring from coronary artery disease. 

In order to assess the perfusion of the heart by the coronary 
arteries you underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed 
multiple blockages in the conroary arteries. We were able to 
place a stent in one of the arteries; the obtuse marginal branch 
of the left circumflex artery that feeds the side portion of the 
heart muscle.

At the time of your cardiac arrest your heart pupming function 
was depressed. A most recent echocardiogram revealed that the 
pumping function has greatly improved since the time of your 
arrest.

You have been started on the following new medications:
Aspirin 81 mg daily: this is taken to decrease clot in the 
coronary arteries

Atorvastatin 80mg daily: this is a cholesterol medication taken 
to decrease worsening of plaque formation.

Lisinopril 5mg daily: this decreases the resistance the heart 
has to pump against and thereby decreased the blood pressure

Metoprolol XL 100mg daily: this medication decresases the 
workload of the heart by decreasing the heart rate and thereby 
the blood pressure

Ticagelor 90mg two times a day: This medication decreases the 
risk of clot formation where the stent was placed. 

KCL 20meq daily: you have required Potaassium daily since your 
admission. You should take this daily and then have labs checked 
on ___ by visiting nursing to assess your response. 

PLEASE CONTINUE:
Metformin 100mg XL twice a day for your diabetes
Sertraline 200mg daily for depression
Levothyroxeine 50mcg daily
 
PLEASE HOLD until seen by your PCP/Cardiologist:
Wellbutrin
Mirtazapine

****Failure to take the Ticagelor and the aspirin could result 
in a lifethreatening heart attack**** 

You have been set up with a Lifevest. The details of this device 
have been discussed with you. If you go into a lifethreatening 
arrythmia again, this device will detect that arrythmia and 
deliver an electric shock to return you to a normal sinus 
rythym. The plan is for you to eventually receieve an internal 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in the future once your heart 
has been given time to recover from your recent cardiac arrest. 
This will be discussed in follow up with the electrophysiology 
team as an outpatient.

You should avoid stressful situations and exercise while you are 
wearing the lifevest. You also CANNOT drive with the lifevest. 
You may participate in your reguilar activities including 
walking as long as this does not cause you physical strain.  
  
You will need a variety of follow up appointments as detailed 
below.

You will need labs in 6 weeks to assess your liver function and 
cholesterol panel since we increased your statin or cholesterol 
medication.  You will also need your electrolytes and your 
kidney function checked on ___ as we have started 
you on a medication called Lisinopril and a potassium 
supplement. 

Today we discussed heart failure and the need to weigh yourself 
every day before breakfast as well as the improtance of 
following a low salt diet. If your weight goes up by more than 3 
lbs in 2 days you should call Dr. ___ cardiologist). 

If you have any questions or concerns related to your symptoms 
or your hospitalization you can call the heartline which has 
been given to you with your discharge paperwork.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with PMH of T2DM, CKD, HTN, focal motor 
status epilepticus for which he was admitted in ___, 
history of TIAs considered ASA failure and started on Plavix, 
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purupura, who presented to ___ 
earlier today with 2 days of worsening inability to tolerate 
secretions, ""hot potato voice,"" and fevers in the setting of 
having had a sore throat for the past 1 week. 

On presentation to the ED he was found to have a swollen 
inferior soft palate, left-sided neck swelling, a marbled voice, 
and inability to swallow secretions. A CT neck was obtained 
which showed sialolithiasis with sialadenitis of the L 
submandibular gland and no drainable fluid collection. The 
airway appeared patent, and based on clinical findings by the ED 
team he was felt to most likely have Ludwig's angina and was 
given decadron and Unasyn.  He was admitted to the TSICU under 
the intensivist service.  

In the TSICU, the patient appeared well with no difficulty 
controlling secretions or protecting his airway; per daughter at 
bedside the patient improved significantly after receiving IV 
dexamethasone and IV unasyn in the ED. OMFS and ENT were 
contacted, and they confirmed that the patient has sialithiasis 
and sialadenitis; no Ludwig's Angina and no operative 
indication. Per their recommendations, he was continued on 
Unasyn and daily dexamethasone, and was given sialogogues for 
his sialithiasis. On tele he was noticed to have possible first 
degree block with dropped ventricular beats, EP consulted for 
concern for AV block, which subsequently revealed itself to be a 
Mobitz 1. Later became 2:1, asymptomatic and maintaining BPs but 
with episodes of bradycardia to ___ overnight for which he was 
kept in the ICU. Also of note, while NPO for airway watch, he 
was given IV conversions of home keppra and phenytoin and 
clobazam was transitioned to IV Ativan which was actually held 
due to bradycardia. He had no seizure-like activity during this 
admission.

He continued to do well into the morning of ___. He was 
restarted on PO home medications and tolerated a regular diet. 
He had no issues with airway or respirations. Per OMFS he was 
started on augmentin ___nd peridex and cleared for 
discharge home from their perspective. Cardiology also saw the 
patient in regards to his suspected AV block and felt that he 
had no indications for intervention or medication adjustment.  
He was thus discharged home from the TSICU with detailed 
discharge instructions and outpatient follow-up in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who initially presented 
with severe abdominal pain. At that time, no obvious findings on 
CT scan and no obvious leak was appreciated. Given her pain and 
significant CT findings, it was decided that she would benefit 
from a diagnostic laparoscopy. At that time, I was concerned 
that she may actually have a gastric perforation and may have a 
gallbladder issue that could potentially be addressed 
laparoscopically. Thus, we decided to start the case 
laparoscopically with potential conversion to an open procedure 
if a significant
lesion in the stomach was appreciated. The risks and benefits of 
the procedure were described in detail to the patient. Despite 
these risks, she chose to proceed with surgery. She was found to 
have a gastric perforation and therefore converted to 
exploratory laparotomy with ___ patch and placement of a 
Pravena vac. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a IV dialudid 
PCA and then transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone 
once tolerating a diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression and nasojejunal 
tube in place for feeding.  On POD2 tube feeding were started 
through the doboff. On POD3 the NGT was accidently  removed by 
the patient when sneezing. She was kept NPO (except tube feeds). 
On POD5 she underwent upper GI leak test that was unclear and 
therefore was repeated on POD7 and negative for leak. Doboff was 
removed and she was given a regular diet with good tolerability. 
H.Pylori result was positive and therefore she was started on 
quadruple therapy once tolerating a diet. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. H.Pylori quadrupal therapy 
started and prescribed 2 week course. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

IMAGING:
CXR ___:
Lungs are low volume with diffuse parenchymal opacification 
within the right lung which is new since the prior study and 
could represent pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  
Follow-up to complete resolution after course of antibiotics in 
___ weeks is recommended.  There are small bilateral effusions 
with mild interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is seen 

ERCP ___:
The scout film revealed previous stents in place. 
What appeared to be an uncovered metal stent was found in the 
bile duct at the major papilla with a plastic double pigtail 
stent inside.  
After biliary plastic stent removal, the bile duct was deeply 
cannulated with the balloon. 
Given suspicion of debris, the bile duct was swept repeatedly 
with the balloon and copious sludge and stones were extracted 
successfully. 
There was some tissue in-growth seen within the stent. 
A small amount of contrast was injected showing patent bile 
ducts proximally at the CHD and intrahepatic branches. 
___ x 5cm double pigtail plastic and ___ x 7cm biliary plastic 
straight stents were placed into the bile duct to facilitate 
drainage. 
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with dementia, hypertension, CAD status post 
LAD stent, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial 
fibrillation, ampullary mass requiring ERCP with stenting 
implicated by recurrent cholangitis, who presented with sepsis 
due to cholangitis.

# Acute cholangitis
# Transaminitis: Patient with history of cholangitis and biliary 
stents presented to OSH on ___ with 3 days of fever, RUQ, and 
jaundice. CT a/p and RUQ ultrasound concerning with common bile 
duct and marked
intrahepatic ductal dilatation and gallbladder sludge without 
evidence of cholecystitis. LFTs on admission were elevated (ALT 
111, AST 56, Alk Phos 423), Tbili 7.6. ERCP performed ERCP ___ 
with removal of plastic stent along with sludge and stones.  
LFTs trended down after the intervention.  She was placed on 
cefpodoxime and metronidazole, transitioned from 
piperacillin-tazobactam, for planned seven-day course, to cover 
both cholangitis and possible pneumonia noted below.  The family 
deferred further intevention (cholecystectomy, scheduled repeat 
ERCP) at this time, and will decide based on if patient requires 
a procedure acutely in the future.

# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
# Pneumonia: Her exam was most consistent with atelectasis in 
the setting of ICU stay and ERCP procedure. 
CHF and aspiration or other pneumonia are remote considerations 
though she appeared to be improving clinically.  Imaging showed 
infiltrates suspicious for pneumonia, so antibiotics for 
cholangitis were chosen to also cover potential pneumonia, as 
noted above.

#Tachycardia
#Atrial flutter
#Atrial fibrillation: She has a history of atrial fibrillation 
for which she takes Atenolol. Upon arrival to the ED, she was 
tachycardic to 154 and EKG showed atrial flutter.  She was given 
2.5 metoprolol.  Home dose of atenolol was later resumed.

#Diabetes: Previously took Metformin 500mg daily. A1C was 6.0 in 
___, so she was instructed to stop taking the 
Metformin.  She was placed on an insulin sliding scale during 
her admission.

#Hypertension: home atenolol was resumed.

#Papillary neoplasm of ampulla of Vater: Hypoechoic mass in the 
periportal region on Ultrasound. Likely at
least in part causing obstruction leading to cholangitis.  She 
will continue to have outpatient follow-up for this, with PCP 
appointment scheduled.

#CAD s/p LAD stent History of CAD and LAD stent. Takes aspirin 
81 mg daily. EKG on presentation had no ischemic changes and 
troponin was <.01.  Aspirin was resumed.

#Dementia
#Anxiety: History of senile dementia with significant anxiety. 
Takes Seroquel 12.5mg TID, which was resumed.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==============
# Follow-up: patient will follow up with her PCP.  The family 
deferred further intevention (cholecystectomy, scheduled repeat 
ERCP) at this time, and will decide based on if patient requires 
a procedure acutely in the future.  

# Code status: Full code but only limited trial.  Admitting 
physician discussed this with her son/HCP and he is considering 
making her DNR. It was explained that this would be quite 
reasonable and that this would not have changed the way we 
treated her during this hospital stay. He said would not want 
her to have a prolonged course of CPR but he is not comfortable 
yet with making her DNR.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal 
pain from an OSH with a known history of gallstones. A consult 
was placed to the acute care surgery team who admitted the 
patient for possible laproscopic cholecystectomy and ERCP. She 
was made NPO and given maintenance fluids.

On hospital day 2, her liver functions tests were globally 
trending down. This indicated possible passing of the gallstone 
through the common bile duct. She also had improvement of her 
pain symtpoms. At this point she was taken to the operating room 
for a laproscopic cholecystectomy which showed a inflamed 
gallbladder which had multiple small stones inside. A JP drain 
was placed as the abdomen had to be irrigated due to some 
contents from the gallbladder spilling into the abdominal 
cavity. The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not 
have any post operative complications.

On hospital day 3, her pain was well controlled. She was 
advanced to a clear diet. Her liver function tests continued to 
trend downward. She was started on a regular diet for dinner 
however took very little in. The surgical site did not appear 
inflamed or infected without signs of erythema or purulent 
discharge. The JP drain continued to drain moderate amount of 
serosanguinous fluid.

On hospital day 4, her pain was again well controlled, her LFTs 
continued to trend down and the patient did not complain of any 
pain. She tolerated regular diet. Since the drain continued to 
output a mild amuont of serosanguinous fluid, she was given 
drain teaching and discharged with the JP drain in place with 
home services to help her care for the drain.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest 
radiographs: 
  
Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces. No 
evidence of 
pneumonia or CHF. 
.
___ Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.   
A patent foramen ovale is present with right to left shunting of 
agitated saline contrast during Valsalva.  
.
___ Lower Extremity doppler ultrasound
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in right or left lower 
extremity.
.
___ Cardiac Catheterisation
Change for 6 ___ XB3 guide.  The initial plan was to pass the
wire as the primary reperfusion device.  A Pilot 50 Wire was
passed in a prolapsed fashion but this did not restore flow. 
Given that the patient was pain free and the small territory at
risk, it was decided to avoid further attempts at recanalization
(with balloon angioplasty) given risk of dissection, 
perforation.
The patient had intermittent chest pain at the end of the
procedure and was started on IV TNG and administered opiates 
with
resolution of chest pain.  He left the laboratory in stable
condition.
.
___ Foot XRay
Three views show the bony structures and joint spaces to be
essentially within normal limits. No dorsal swelling or evidence 
of erosion
is appreciated. No calcaneal spurs.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M w/ PMH of prostate CA, HTN, presenting with distal 
apical NSTEMI.
.
# APICAL LAD STEMI:  Distal LAD thrombosis with distal apical 
infarct, s/p unsuccessful recanalisation during cardiac 
catheterisation.  No other evidence of coronoary atherosclerosis 
was found. Echocardiogram whowed preserved EF and no ventricular 
wall motion abnormalities. However, he was noted to have a 
patent formane ovale.  Given absence of atherosclerotic disease, 
PFO and known CA prostate, thromboembolic event from a possible 
proximal DVT remains a possible etiology for his STEMI.  Cardiac 
enzymes peaked ___ and trended down prior to discharge. He 
was treated with a heparin drip for 2 days after the procedure, 
as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol.  He was started on 
lisinopril and atorvastatin, but these were held in the setting 
of acute kidney injury.  He will need to continue aspirin 
lifelong and clopidogrel for at least one year given his 
prothrombotic state.  Atorvastation was restarted at the time of 
discharge.
.  
# s/p CATH: unsuccessful attempt at wire recanalisation of 
distal LAD.
.
# THROMBOEMBOLISM: Cardiac cath shows no evidence of coronary 
atherosclerosis.  MI site is unusual and patient has PFO, 
history of prostate cancer, prothrombotic state. LENIs were 
negative, but did not include an evaluation of the iliac 
arteries.  He will continue aspirin and plavix for 
anticoagulation following discharge.  
.
# Fever: Etiology unclear. UA, CXR clear.  Urine cultures and 
blood cultures pending.  However, timing of fever suggests 
possible link with gout flare.  Other etiologies include: 
infection, post-MI, thromboembolism/PE, B-symptoms from cancer. 
His fever curve trended down spontaneously prior to discharge.
.
# Thigh pain - bilateral. Could be from strenous workout pt 
reports. CKs coming down but CK so out of proportion elevated 
compared to MB. We just started statin which can cause myopathy 
but states thigh pain since presentation. Pt without significant 
CAD that we know of.  We held his statin, but restarted it at 
the time of discharge.
.
# ___: Cr of 1.4 on ___ up from baseline of 1.0.  Could be 
secondary to high 
CK. Uric acid was 6.6, urinalysis was clear.  We gave him a 
small fluid bolus. 
.
# Right ankle pain - Most likely gout flair. pt with history of 
gout. A foot Xray was performed which showed no pathology.  His 
pain was controlled with percocet and colchicine.   
.  
# HTN: BP was high on presentation and he was initially on a 
nitro drip, but this was rapidly weaned and he was treated with 
metoprolol instead.  He was also started on lisinopril, but this 
was held given ___. He will need reevaluation
.
# Cardiac Risk factors: patient has hypertension.
Lipid panel was unremarkable.  HbA1C was pending at the time of 
discharge.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ACE inhibitor was held due to creatinine 
elevation.
Please reassess hypertension and creatinine as an outpatient and 
consider restarting an ACE inhibitor if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted with a heart 
attack. We performed a cardiac catheterization which showed a 
small blockage in the blood supply to the apex of your heart, 
but no other abnormalities in the blood flow to your heart.  We 
attempted to open this blockage, but were unable to do so and 
did not attempy further since the reduction of heart function 
was very small.  An echocardiogram was performed and this 
confirmed that your heart was beating normally.  The 
echocardiogram also showed that you have an open flap in your 
heart forming an abnormal connection between the right and left 
sides of your heart (a patent foramen ovale).  This kind of flap 
is found in over 10% of people.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
-STARTED Aspirin
-STARTED Clopidogrel
-STARTED Metoprolol
-STARTED Atorvastatin
-STARTED Oxycodone and Colchicine for pain
-STOPPED your home benzapril
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

","||startoftext||The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has a history of prostate cancer, treated with radiation therapy, and no other significant past medical history. He is allergic to Gadolinium-containing agents. 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. An attempt was made to open the lesion, but it was not successful, and the patient was treated medically to avoid a potential procedural complication. 

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and he was prescribed medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. His physical examination was normal, with no signs of cardiac failure or respiratory distress. 

Laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage, but his kidney and liver function tests were normal. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, V4-6, consistent with a STEMI. 

The patient's chest X-ray and echocardiogram showed normal heart and lung structures, with no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure. ||endoftext||"

STUDIES:
TTE ___: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a 
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally 
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve 
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular 
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is borderline 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the 
left ventricular ejection fraction is increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ F with h/o NSTEMI in ___ s/p cardiac 
catheterization (50% mid-LAD stenosis and 90% RCA stenosis with 
collaterals) without PCI who is transferred from ___ 
___ for cardiac catheterization after presenting with chest 
pain and shortness of breath on exertion, found to have 2 vessel 
dx w/ thrombus in ramus s/p POBA and occluded LCx w/ thrombus 
s/p DES, c/b bradycardia/hypotension requiring pressors/IABP, 
now resolved. 
  
# CAD: Presentation c/w unstable angina, likely explains DOE, 
was found on cardiac catheterization to have LCx/ramus thrombus 
and diffuse RCA disease, s/p POBA to ramus and DES to LCx. 
Procedure was complicated by vagal response requiring 
pressors/atropine/IABP. She was monitored in the CCU overnight 
and then transferred to the floor. At discharge she was 
hemodynamically stable. Her troponin leak was trended to peak 
and was felt to be consistent with post-procedure changes, given 
stable EKG and lack of suggestive symptoms. Her home aspirin was 
continued. She was loaded with Plavix and will require daily 
dual antiplatelet therapy for the next year. Atorvastatin 80mg 
QD was continued. She was started on Carvedilol 3.125 mg BID 
(there was concern that she had some bronchospasm at a higher 
dose, but tolerated this dose well) and her diltiazem was 
discontinued. Her Losartan was switched to Valsartan 160mg QD 
(better outcomes in heart failure). 
 
# Acute on Chronic diastolic heart failure: Likely ischemic 
cardiomyopathy. Appears to have mild systolic/diastolic dysfxn 
per TTE ___, LVEF was 50-55% and there was suggestion of 
impaired filling.   Repeat TTE on ___ showed LVEF 65%, mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired relaxation and 
borderline pulm systolic HTN, minimal aortic valve stenosis. She 
appeared euvolemic on exam. Her home lasix was continued. Her 
Losartan was switched to Valsartan 160mg QD (better outcomes in 
heart failure). 
She was maintained on a 2g Na restriction. As above, she was 
switched from diltiazem to Carvedilol.   

# ___: Carries a diagnosis of stage IV CKD, atrophic kidney, 
baseline proteinuria. At ___ her Cr was elevated to 1.4 on 
admission. This trended down, though she did receive >200 cc's 
of contrast at cath. At discharge her Cr was 1.1.
 
# pAF She carries a history of pAF, but is not on 
anticoagulation due to apparent fall risk. CHADS2 is 6 so very 
high risk for stroke. She was monitored on telemetry and was in 
sinus rhythm. As above, she was started on dual antiplatelet 
therapy which she will require for the next year re. DES. 
Anticoagulation should be considered as an outpatient if felt to 
be safe re. fall risk given high stroke risk.     

# Hypertension : BP was reportedly in 180s sytolic at ___ 
___. They were elevated during this admission as well. Her 
BP regimen was adjusted for more optimal control in the setting 
of coronary disease, to carvedilol and Valsartan, as above. BPs 
at discharge was improved to the systolics 140-160s (baseline 
prior to hospitalization had been SBPs in 160-200s).  
 
# S/p TIA: Continued home ASA 325mg, statin daily.  

# NIDDM: Home Januvia was held in favor of gentle Humalog 
insulin SS. At discharge her homes med was restarted.  

# Hyperlipidemia: Home atorvastatin was continued.  
 
# COPD: Continued on albuterol-ipatroprium, Advair (replacement 
for symbicort)
 
# Gout: Continued home allopurinol  
 
# GERD: Continued home ranitidine

TRANSITION ISSUES:
- Started on dual antiplatelet therapy (ASA/Plavix) given new 
DES. Will require full dose aspirin for one month post-cath and 
Plavix for one year.
- ___ benefit from warfarin at some point in the future if the 
bleeding risk of triple therapy is felt to be acceptable given 
high risk of stroke (CHADS2=6)
- New BP regimen: Carvedilol and Valsartan (Losartan and 
amlodipine were discontinued).  Patient will need BP check at 
PCP ___ discharge and further BP management.

with some air leak. Dr. ___, thoracic surgery was 
consulted during the procedure and it was recommended that a 
chest tube be placed. The lung was densely adherent to the 
diaphragm. She tolerated the procedure, however she was not 
extubated, and was transferred to the SICU post operatively. The 
cyst pathology was Benign mesothelial inclusion cyst.
The patient was extubated on POD 1, the chest tube was removed 
on POD 3 and she remained in the SICU until POD 3 and she was 
transferred to ___ 10.
On POD 4 the lateral JP drain was noted to appear bilious and 
drain bilirubin was 11.2 (serum 0.7 same day). The following day 
she was sent for an ERCP, The pancreatic duct was filled with 
contrast, the course and caliber of the duct were normal with no 
evidence of filling defects, masses, chronic pancreatitis or 
other abnormalities. Cannulation of the biliary duct was 
performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique, 
Extravasation of contrast was noted at the periphery of the 
liver, consistent with bile leak. An 8cm by ___ ___ 
plastic biliary stent was placed successfully with excellent 
drainage of bile and contrast. 
Post ERCP day 1 she presented with nausea and abdominal pain and 
amylase and lipase were noted to be significantly elevated to 
2932 and 4370 respectively. She was kept NPO for 2 days and then 
slowly advanced from clears to regular diet again. 
Intra-op the patient received 2 units PRBC's and albumin, on POD 
2 she received 2 units PRBCs and then 1 unit each on POD 4 and 
5. Her hematocrit has remained stable since the last 
transfusion.
The patient has tolerated regular diet, and calorie counts 
indicate she is now getting adequate nutrition.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy. She was minimally 
active due to her shortness of breath prior to the surgery and 
will be discharged with home ___. She has been ambulating with 
assist.
Left ankle noted to be slightly swollen and a bit bruised in 
appearance. Non-invasive studies were negative for DVT.
The patient is passing flatus and on a bowel regimen.
She is being sent home with the JP drain still in place.

STUDIES:
___ EKG: Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality. P-R 
interval prolongation. Left axis deviation. Left anterior 
fascicular block. Right bundle-branch block. Precordial Q waves. 
Consider anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Since the previous 
tracing of ___ atrial premature beat is now not seen. 
Otherwise, findings are unchanged. 

___ CT SPINE: 
1. ___ fracture or prevertebral soft tissue swelling. 
2. Multilevel degenerative changes including moderate central 
spinal canal 
narrowing at C3-C4. Canal stenosis predisposes to spinal cord 
injury in the setting of trauma and an MRI is recommended if 
there is concern for cord or ligamentous injury. 
3. New layering left pleural effusion. 

___ CT HEAD: ___ acute intracranial process.

___ CXR: Findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia with 
probable 
bilateral pleural effusions. Please note a moderate pleural 
effusion with 
seen on the left on CT C-spine from earlier today. 

___ CT CHEST (NON CON): 1. Unexplained bilateral nonhemorrhagic 
pleural effusion of uncertain chronicity, moderate on the left, 
small on the right. Pleural surfaces not fully evaluated.  2. 
Small areas of likely pneumonia, right middle lobe, do not 
explain the left predominate pleural effusion.  3. Heavy 
atherosclerotic coronary calcification. Mild global cardiomegaly 
including possible mild pulmonary hypertension.  4. Chronic 
incompletely healed left lower rib fractures. 

___ CT HEAD: ___ evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or other 
acute pathology.

___ Echo: Extremely suboptimal windows. The left atrium is 
elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is ___ pericardial 
effusion. The right ventricle was not visualized.  

___ EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch 
block with possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Left anterior 
fascicular block. Non-diagnostic Q waves in leads V1-V3. 
Non-specific ST segment changes in inferolateral leads in the 
setting of diffuse baseline artifact. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___ baseline artifact is now present confounding 
the interpretation of ST segments. 

___ CXR: Overall worsening of multifocal opacities likely 
multifocal
pneumonia. Increased left and persistent small right pleural 
effusions.

___ Video swallow: There is aspiration and penetration with 
nectar-thin liquids. There is spillover into the vallecula seen 
with all consistencies of liquids. For further details, please 
refer to speech and swallow division note in OMR. IMPRESSION: 1. 
Penetration and aspiration seen with nectar-thick liquids.

___ CXR:  There is a new moderate right-sided layering pleural 
effusion. A
left-sided layering pleural effusion appears mild-to-moderate in 
size and
likely unchanged, allowing for differences in technique. 
Increased
opacification is noted throughout the right lung with a 
heterogeneous pattern.  There are also associated left lower 
lung opacities, but similar. There is ___ pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: Worsening generalized right lung opacification, 
suggesting worsening of multifocal pneumonia including a new 
right-sided pleural effusion.

___ pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.  Reactive 
mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, histocytes, and neutrophils.

___ CXR: Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than 
right, has decreased substantially on the right following 
thoracentesis. ___ pneumothorax. Region of heterogeneous 
peribronchial opacification in the right mid lung could be 
pneumonia. There is ___ pulmonary edema. The heart is top normal 
size, mediastinal veins mildly dilated.

___ pleural fluid pending

___ video swallow: The study was conducted in collaboration with
speech pathology. Thin, nectar, and puree consistency were 
administered by
mouth. The examination is very limited secondary to the patient 
releasing
boluses out of the oral cavity. There is premature spill to the 
valleculae.
There was ___ penetration or aspiration seen with a very small 
quantity of thin and nectar consistency consumed. Puree was not 
swallowed. There is a
moderate amount of residue in the valleculae. There is a small 
amount of
residue in the piriform sinuses. IMPRESSION: Exam limited as 
described above. ___ aspiration seen. Moderate residue in the 
valleculae.

___ CXR: An AP upright view of the chest was obtained. There has 
been
marked interval reduction in the left pleural effusion without 
definite
residual pleural fluid identified. A moderate right pleural 
effusion is
largely unchanged as is right basilar airspace opacification 
likely
representing atelectasis. Right upper lobe parenchymal opacities 
and air
bronchograms are more prominent on the current study, possibly 
reflecting
worsening infection. The left lung is clear. ___ pneumothorax is 
identified.
___ osseous abnormalities are noted.  IMPRESSION: 1. Resolution 
of left pleural effusion status post thoracentesis. ___ 
pneumothorax identified.
2. Stable moderate right pleural effusion and right basilar 
airspace opacity likely representing atelectasis.  3. Worsening 
parenchymal opacity and air bronchograms within the right upper 
lobe, potentially representing progression of infection. 
Clinical correlation is recommended.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with history of hypertension, CAD s/p DES to LCx 
(___), dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and chronic renal 
insufficiency who presented from home s/p fall with leukocytosis 
and multifocal infiltrates on CXR found to have aspiration 
pneumonia and severe dysphagia.  
.
#Fall: Patient fell without any prodromal symptoms and ___ 
post-ictal state.  History was most consistent with mechanical 
fall and patient with history of rare falls in past.  ___ 
evidence of ischemic changes or arrhythmia on EKG.  Last echo in 
___ with ___ systolic dysfunction or obstructive pathology.  He 
was not orthostatic on evaluation.   
.  
#Delirium: Patient presented from home after a fall and 
developed delirium while hospitalized.  His delirium was 
initially complicated by severe agitation requiring a 1:1 aide 
___, two point restraints, and occasional anti-psychotics to 
calm him when he became a safety threat. Delirium attributed to 
hospitalization, NSTEMI and pneumonia. Attempted to re-orient 
patient and normalize sleep wake cycle with good success.  His 
delirium was predominantly hypoactive during the last week of 
his admission.  
.
#Dysphagia:  His dysphagia was a chronic problem that was 
acutely worsened by his fall and subsequent delirium.  
Swallowing function extremely poor on video swallow, and he 
continued to aspirate daily.  He was kept NPO on aspiration 
precautions with nutrition via PPN in the hope that his delirium 
would clear and he would regain his strength to swallow back at 
baseline.  He had a repeat video swallow which revealed 
persistent poor swallowing function.  The family decided that 
regardless of the aspiration risk, Dr. ___ want to eat 
and would assume the risk.  They chose a modified diet in order 
to slightly lessen a large aspiration risk.
.
#Pneumonia: Patient with significant leukocytosis with 
neutrophilia and ___ localizing symptoms on admission. Initial 
CXR with multifocal opacities and left pleural effusion 
concerning for pneumonia but ___ new cough, SOB, or fevers at 
home. ___ recent hospitalizations. Received a dose of 
levofloxacin in the ED. Levofloxacin was discontinued as it was 
not felt that patient had a clinical pneumonia, but more likely 
an asiration pneumonitis (white count normalized overnight). 
However, when patient developed a new oxygen requirement in the 
setting of delirium concern for a developing infectious process 
increased and he was started on vanco/CTX/flagly to cover HCAP 
and aspiration pneumonia. Patient triggered several times for 
hypoxia which was felt secondary to poor clearance of secretions 
and mucus plugging. He received chest ___, mucomyst nebs, 
oropharynx suctioning, and humidified supplemental oxygen.  He 
continued to aspirate during his hospital course with transient 
desaturations.
.
#Pleural effusions: His course was also complicated by pleural 
effusions necessitating right thoracentesis of 900 cc on ___ and 
left thoracentesis of 1.4 L on ___.  Pleural fluid cytology was 
negative for malignant cells. 
.  
#NSTEMI: Patient with history of CAD s/p DES to left cx in ___ 
for 70% lesion. Reported a single episode of chest pain the 
night prior to admission which was short lived and self 
resolved. Reported that he typically gets it once a week. 
Troponins were initially checked and elevated - attributed to 
underlying chronic renal insufficiency. CK/MB flat. In the 
setting patient's acute change in mental status another set of 
enzymes were checked and these ended up initially peaking 
(troponin at 0.50, CKMB 25). Cardiology was consulted and felt 
patient's symptoms were most likely related to demand ischemia 
in the setting of underlying pulmonary pathology and agitation. 
He was given aspirin (PO or PR) but further anticoagulation was 
not started. Echocardiogram was of poor quality but show ___ 
major wall motion abnormalities.  Statin was transiently held 
given patient's aspiration risk and NPO status.  Troponin was 
found to continue to rise to 1.28 ___K-MB and CK 
confirming prior event.
.  
#Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 1.7. 
Patient trended down to 1.4 during hospitalization as he was 
given PPN and IV fluids. 
.  
#Hypertension: Intermittently hypertensive when agitated.  He 
was continued on home lisinopril when taking POs. 
.
#Enterococcus in Urine: Bland UA but enterococcus (10K-100K) on 
culture. This was felt to be a sign of colonization rather than 
acute infection and thus patient was not treated for UTI. 
.  
#BPH: ___ active issues. Continued home finasteride.   
.  
#Anemia: Chronic in nature. Patient at baseline. ___ signs of 
active bleeding.   
.  
#Osteoporosis: He was followed by Dr. ___ was on 
Actonel as an outpatient. Next BMD scan was due on ___.  ___ 
fractures on CT head or spine, so he was continued outpatient 
calcium and vitamin D.
.
#Code Status: The patient was full code at the beginning of his 
admission, however, his HCP changed it to DNR/DNI prior to the 
end of his admission.  We had a series of family meetings during 
this admission.  This decision was made in accordance with what 
his wife deemed his goals of care: to be home and to avoid tubes 
and drains.  He was discharged home and the family chose to 
enroll him in hospice care.  He was discharged on a modified 
diet and his family understood that he had a 100% chance of 
repeat aspiration, and that it was impossible to predict when he 
would have a significant aspiration.  They signed the DNR/DNI 
forms, and will call the hospice nurse should he have a 
recurrent event.

","||startoftext||The patient is a 91-year-old male who presented to the emergency department after falling at home. He reported a mild episode of chest tightness the previous night, which he attributed to gas pain. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. On admission, his physical examination revealed a small abrasion on his head, poor inspiratory effort, and decreased breath sounds in his left lung base. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis, and a chest X-ray was concerning for multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient underwent thoracentesis on two occasions and was prescribed levofloxacin and tetanus vaccination. He was also given 1 liter of normal saline and had a CT scan of his spine, which showed moderate central spinal canal narrowing at C3-C4. He was discharged with a diagnosis of pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's medications at discharge included levofloxacin, tetanus vaccination, and unspecified medications. He had a history of allergies to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. ||endoftext||"

consistent with known cholangiocarcinoma. 
2. Nondilated gallbladder with mild wall thickening, similar in 
appearance. 
3. Indwelling biliary stents and mild intrahepatic biliary 
ductal dilation is not significantly changed since the prior 
study.  Cholangitis cannot be excluded sonographically.  
Correlation with clinical and laboratory assessment is 
recommended. 

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of ___  
IMPRESSION:  
1.  4.9 x 3.5 x 4.1 cm heterogeneously hypodense right hepatic 
mass compatible with known cholangiocarcinoma, with unchanged 
centrum necrotic components. 
2.  Unchanged position of two common biliary ductal stents.  
Trace 
intrahepatic ductal dilation is largely unchanged from the prior 
examination. No ascites. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with cholangiocarcinoma stage ___, who 
presented with N/V/diarrhea, RUQ pain and hypotension.

# Right upper quadrant pain: Most concerning for cholangitis vs 
disease progression. Similar to prior presentations. Normal LFTs 
except for elevated AP, no leukocytosis, afebrile, and imaging 
unchanged. Her pain was controlled with home pain regimen, with 
IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Palliative care was consulted 
for pain control recommendations. ERCP was consulted, and took 
her to ___ on ___ for stent exchange.  Patient was discharged 
on one week of cipro and flagyl.  Patient will follow with 
gastroenterology for Celiac plexus block treatment.

# Hypotension: most likely secondary to N/V/diarrhea and poor PO 
intake. Resolved with 4 L IVF. Cholangitis also in differential, 
but given no fever, no change in imaging, normal LFTs less 
likely. Nevertheless, she was treated with zosyn for emperic 
coverage. Blood cultures remained no growth at the time of 
discharge . In order to minimize future hospitalizations, 
palliative care recommended coordiation with ___ for home IVF in 
the future if she is unable to take PO and keep up with her 
fluids. 

# Cholangiocarcinoma: Locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma stage 
___ (T2 N2 M0), s/p seven cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin as 
well as CyberKnife therapy, being treated with palliative 
intent. ERCP on ___ with stent exchange. Palliative care team 
followed during admission. She has outpatient oncology follow-up 
in place. 

#Asthma: no wheezing on exam, received nebs prn

#Anxiety/Depression: continued on home citalopram 30 daily and 
home clonazepam qhs.

#GERD: continued home dose famotidine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the ___ Spine Surgery Service on 
___ and taken to the Operating Room for L3-S1 interbody 
fusion through an anterior approach. Please refer to the 
dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was 
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU 
in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for 
postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were 
given per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled 
with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the operating room for a 
scheduled T12-L3 decompression with PSIF as part of a staged 
2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated operative note 
for further details. The second surgery was also without 
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a 
stable condition. Postoperative HCT was stable. On HD#3 she 
returned for a scheduled T10-S1 posterior fusion with 
instrumentation.  A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at 
the time of the posterior surgery remained in place until postop 
day one. 
She developed a post-operative ileus and an NG tube was placed.  
The ileuse was slowly resolving and NG tube was removed with 
diet advanced.  
She developed acute distension and was transferred to the TICU 
for monitoring. There, an NG tube was placed and her abdomen was 
decompressed.  CT scan showed no sign of blockage.
She was subsequently transferred out of the TICU and monitored.
She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was 
advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain 
medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley remained in place due 
to post-op urinary incontenance.  This will be managed by her 
PCP. She was fitted with a TLSO brace for ambulation. Physical 
therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Hospital 
course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day of discharge the 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on 
oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.

History of Present Illness:
___ female with hx of severe COPD on home oxygen, morbid 
obesity, hx CAD s/p PCI, chronic pseudotumor cerebri, presents 
from OSH where she originally presented for an ___ guided lumbar 
puncture for therapeutic drainage. The patient had lost the keys 
to her portable oxygen tanks and went to an OSH for a 
therapeutic LP without her oxygen. However in waiting for her 
procedure, she developed some chest pain and was noted to be 
hypoxic to the 50% on RA. Her chest pain resolved within minutes 
and she was placed on 4L oxygen and her O2 sats went up to 87% 
and an ABG was performed and was ___. A CXR was obtained 
and reportedly had evidence of an infiltrate. She was given 
nebulizers, steroids, and moxifloxacin and was transfered to 
___ for ___ guided lumbar puncture.
.
In the ___ ED, initial VS were: 98 85 159/89 18 91% 4L. She 
received labs notable for lactate 2.4, HCT 54, HCO3 32 and blood 
cultures were sent. CXR showed hyperexpansion without clear 
evidence of an infiltrate or pulmonary edema. She received a CT 
head which was consistent with pseudotumor cerebri. She received 
duonebs and vancomycin was added to her antibiotic regimen. 
Oxygen saturations were in the ___ on 4L NC. She reports her 
baseline oxygenation saturation is 82%. She was admitted to the 
MICU for oxygen monitoring while she awaits ___ guided LP. Access 
includes 2 PIV 20G on the right.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with severe COPD on 2L home oxygen, chronic 
pseudotumor cerebri, with underlying chronic hypoxia, presents 
from OSH with hypoxia and headaches here for ___ guided lumbar 
puncture for therapeutic drainage.  
.  
#Hypoxia: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have O2 sats 
in the mid-80s on 4L. Her CXR demonstrated evidence of mild CHF 
and she was diuresed with her home dose of lasix and admitted to 
the MICU for oxygen monitoring. Her acetazolamide was held given 
its potential to exacerbate her hypercarbia. She maintained her 
oxygen saturations and was transferred to the floor where her 
oxygen was weaned to 4L while being treated with her home 
regimen of nebulizers and Spiriva for her history of COPD. Given 
that she had not formally seen a pulmonologist for the workup of 
her hypoxia, she was setup with outpatient follow-up with ___ 
Pulmonary at discharge. It was also felt that the patient likely 
has obstructive sleep apnea given her body habitus, or even some 
hypoventilation syndrome. Given the possible complexity of her 
sleep-breathing patterns, Sleep Medicine recommended that the 
patient follow-up with them in clinic as well, to discuss Sleep 
Study and CPAP/BiPAP.   
.
#Pseudotumor cerebri: Upon admission, the patient complained of 
headaches that were consistent with her history of pseudotumor 
cerebri that was subsequently confirmed on a head-CT. Her 
acetazolamide was held given concern for exacerbating her 
hypercarbia. Throughout her admission, her headaches were stable 
without any visual symptoms and appropriately controlled with 
tylenol and oxycodone. Her aspirin and plavix were held 
(patient's husband reported that he had not given these to her 
X2 weeks given her somnolence on pain meds for her headaches). 
She subsequently received an ___ guided therapeutic LP (___) 
and tolerated it well. Her headaches resolved following her LP 
and aspirin and plavix were restarted. Per the patient, she 
often can go months to years after a therapeutic LP without 
symptoms or need for retapping (last LP in ___. 
.
#Bradycardia: Prior to transfer from the MICU, the patient was 
noted to have HRs in the 40-50s which continued while on the 
floor. She was asymptomatic, and her EKG was notable for sinus 
bradycardia with no conduction defects.  Her metoprolol dose was 
adjusted and her HR increased to the ___ with activity.  She was 
discharged on a lower dose of metoprolol.
.
Inactive Issues:
.
#Eye Crusting: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have 
mild crusting of her left eyelid without any evidence of 
conjunctivitis or blepheritis. She was continued on her home 
blephamide cream and her crusting improved over the course of 
her hospitalization
.  
#CAD and history of MI: During her hospitalization, the patient 
acknowledged some chest heaviness without radiation, dyspnea, 
nausea, or paresthesias that resolved within minutes. Her EKG 
was without ST/T changes and her cardiac enzymes were normal. 
She had no subsequent episodes of chest pain throughout her 
hospitalization and was continued on her home regimen of 
lipitor, metoprolol and imdur. According to records obtained 
from ___ where the patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization in ___, the patient has three Cypher (DES) 
stents in her LAD distribution. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient NEEDS to have outpatient pulmonology follow-up. Her 
pulmonary disease is very poorly controlled at this point and 
she is at risk of rapidly worsening from Cor Pulmonale. This 
information was discussed at length with the patient, who has an 
appointment with ___ Pulmonary. 
- Patient should have outpatient sleep study. She has an 
appointment with ___ Sleep Medicine 
- Please follow-up heart rate as metoprolol dose was adjusted as 
inpatient to 12.5mg BID given bradycardia.
- Patient demonstrates significant interest in smoking 
cessation. QuitWorks and Nicotine patches were provided to the 
patient. She should discuss this with her primary care 
physician, as it will help with her ongoing lung disease

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs. ___,

___ you for allowing us to participate in your care. You were 
admitted to the hospital because you were noted to have very low 
oxygen saturations. You were placed on more oxygen and treated 
with nebulizers for shortness of breath. 

You were also complaining of significant headaches that were 
consistent with your history of pseudotumor cerebri, which was 
confirmed on imaging of your head. You were treated with a 
lumbar puncture which helped resolve your symptoms.

Your heart rates were also noted to be low and we decided to 
decrease your metoprolol dosing, after which your heart rates 
returned to the normal range. We will let your PCP know of this 
change in your medication.

You expressed an interest in stopping smoking, which would be 
really good for your lungs. Please check out QuitWorks 
___, which provides smoking cessation support and 
often free/discounted nicotine patches/inhalers/gum. 
___/

Please note the following changes in your medications:
-START METOPROLOL 12.5mg twice a day
-STOP Acetazolamide for your Pseudotumor cerebri as it can 
worsen your breathing/COPD

Please bring this paperwork with you to your next appointments 
so your doctors are aware of your recent hospitalization.

___ from OSH for L sided pneumonia and pleural effusion, 
admitted to MICU for medical management of left pleural 
effusion, hypotension (low at baseline), ___ on CKD, and 
electrolyte derangement. 
 
# L Pleural Effusion - Etiology was considered in setting of 
pneumonia (leukocytosis with left shift, cough, though afebrile) 
vs. malignancy vs. CHF exacerbation. Pleural fluid studies were 
consistent with exudative effusion (elevated LDH, fluid/serum 
protein .46), making infectious etiology most likely. Patient 
initially received CTX/Azithro at OSH. Given GI symptoms in 
setting of slight hyponatremia, we sent Legionella antigen, 
which were negative. In the MICU we continued CTX and 
Azithromycin. CT chest showed loculated non hemorrhagic 
effusions. No evidence of occult malignancy. Pleural fluid was 
sent for cytology which was negative. 

# Shock - Patient was initially hypotensive to SBPs ___. 
Distributive is most likely in setting of pulmonary infection. 
Lactate was normal. Pressures become stable with SBPs ___ 
s/p Albumin 25g IV in the ED. Cardiogenic etiology is less 
likely given normal TTE in ___. We continued to treat infection 
as described above.   
 
# Congestive Heart Failure - EF 55-60% on TTE in ___. Patient 
has been taking Lasix 40mg PO TID at home. BNP 28329 (patient 
does have CKD, 797 in ___. She was volume overloaded on exam 
(marked JVD and acute onset ___. Possibly exacerbated in the 
setting of paroxysmal afib. Diuresis was held due to hypotension 
in the MICU; however, on the floor she was digressed with 40 mg 
IV lasix for a total of 9L net negative for LOS. Her lasix was 
switched to 30 mg of Torsemide on discharge for better 
absorption. 

#Pre renal ___: On admission Creatinine elevated to 2.5. On 
___ it was 1.03, though elevated to 3.3 in ___. Likely 
cardiorenal physiology in setting of CHF and RAS (BUN/Cr 30). 
C/b hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and ACD. She 
was diuresed and her Cr improved to normal with discharge of 
0.9. She did have persistently low bicarb that improved with 
supplementation. 

# Atrial fibrillation - CHA2DS2-VASc 5 - Patient managed on 
nadolol at home. She had been started on Eliquis ___, but 
discontinued due to GIB. Patient reports increased palpitations 
over the past several days, no dizziness/lightheadedness. 
Metoprolol tartrate 6.25 IV q6h was started in the ICU and her 
metoprolol was switched to PO and uptitrated for better rate 
control. Free T4 and T3 were WNL. She was discharged on 150 XL

at time of discharge. Celiac's ruled out. Vitamin D 27 and she 
was started on 1/weekly supplementation w/50k. B12/Folate WNL. 
She should continue with Carnation or Ensure shakes TID. 

 # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis - Pure AG metabolic acidosis 
most likely due to uremia. Another possible cause was increased 
acetaminophen ingestion in setting of pain (oxoproline). She was 
not compensating appropriately (pCO2 should be ___, likely 
___ hypoventilation in setting of marked effusion and breathing 
limited by pain (thus also some component of respiratory 
acidosis). Patient received bicarbonate in the ED. Acidosis 
began to improve with improvement in her shock state.  

 # Hyperkalemia - Likely in setting of CKD, exacerbated by 
acidosis. Patient was given Insulin/Dextrose and Calcium 
Gluconate in ED for K of 5.9. Patient received an EKG without 
peaked T waves. Her potassium began to trend toward normal.   

 # Hyperphosphatemia - Chronic issue in setting of CKD, patient 
also has hypocalcemia.  

 # Hypocalcemia - Corrected Ca 7.6. Secondary PTH likely given 
CKD. In setting of hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia and worsening renal 
function. 
 
 # Hyperthyroidism - Patient reportedly had thyroid US within 
last 6mo. R>L thyroid enlargement, which she says has been 
increasing since US.  Patient was continued on her home 
methimazole of 20 mg.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came to us with shortness of breath and we found that you 
likely had a pneumonia and a loculated pleural effusion. Our 
Thoracic surgeons drained the fluid and added a chest tube which 
drained the remaining fluid. A repeat CT shows no pneumonia or 
signs of malignancy. We had endocrine see you who recommended 
seeing an ophthalmologist for your hyperthyroidism. We removed 
nearly 8 liters of fluid from you for a heart failure 
exacerbation. We are changing your Lasix to Toresemide which is 
better absorbed. We are discharging you on 30 mg daily. Please 
follow up with your cardiologist for labs and adjustment of the 
dose. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you the best!
Your ___ Team.  
 
Followup Instructions:

History of Present Illness:
History is obtained from the medical record and from the patient 
with her son serving as interpreter. Please see also OMR notes 
by Dr. ___ ___ ___ for 
additional information. Briefly, Ms. ___ is a ___ year old 
___ woman who has multiple medical problems including 
diet-controlled type II diabetes, hypertension, chronic joint 
pain (osteoarthritis and seronegative RA vs. PMR), and recent 
visual problems with ocular discomfort. She has had recent 
complaints of chest pain and progressive dyspnea on exertion (to 
the point where she has had to crawl up stairs and sit down 
while shopping) for which she has been evaluated by Dr. 
___. 
.
In terms of her chest pain and DOE, she describes both as 
occurring together. The chest pain is present constantly, 
ranging from severity of ___ to ___ and is worse with 
movement, pressure to the chest wall, deep breathing, or 
exertion. The shortness of breath is only with activity and does 
not occur at rest. She describes the chest pain as pressure-like 
in quality and occuring in the center chest to beneath the left 
breast. She has had these symptoms for several months but feels 
that they have been getting worse recently. She has had a cough 
for about the last two months which is occasionally productive 
of ___ sputum; she initially thought that this was due to a 
cold and had some associated runny nose, though now feels cough 
is not due to URI as it has persisted.
.
She underwent echocardiogram in ___ which showed mild LVH 
with preserved ejection fraction (> 55%) and was otherwise 
unrevealing in terms of etiology for her dyspnea. In addition, 
she has had periodic complaints of heart palpitations for which 
she was been monitored by ___ of Hearts; 7 symptomatic episodes 
revealed sinus rhythm at rate ___ with occasional APBs and 
atrial bigeminy.  She did undergo stress test back in ___ by 
___ which was negative for ischemia, but has had no 
further stress testing since that time. Currently, she is 
awaiting ophthalmologic procedure for her eye discomfort, and 
her ophthalmologist at ___ Eye & ___ has recommended complete 
cardiac work up prior to this procedure (details unclear as 
notes are out of our system; however, per Dr. ___ 
note from ___ it is ""non urgent""). In addition, per Dr. 
___ from ___, cardiac catheterization is 
indicated to evaluate for left main disease prior to surgery 
requiring monitored anesthesia care, as well as to further 
evaluate for coronary artery disease given her multiple risk 
factors for atherosclerosis.  She had cardiac catheterization 
planned recently, although this procedure was cancelled given 
her aspirin allergy and the possible need for intervention. The 
patient was given the option of waiting for allergy appointment 
to further evaluate this allergy or for CCU admission for rapid 
desensitization, and chose the latter.
.  
On review of systems, she denies any recent fever, chills, 
nightsweats or rigors. She denies prior history of stroke, TIA, 
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time 
of surgery. No PND or clear orthopnea (must sleep on her side 
secondary to back/spine pain). She does have swelling of the 
ankles which has been stable, as well as swelling in the knees 
from her arthritis (L > R). She has had palpitations for which 
___ has worn ___ monitor as above. She has multiple myalgias and 
joint pains for which she is followed in ___ clinic; 
these are stable. Cough as per HPI with no hemoptysis. No 
N/V/D/C, no abdominal pain, no changes in bowel habits (last BM 
this morning, normal), no black stools or red stools. She has 
had several episodes of LH over the past several days, most

CXR (___):
In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung 
volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse 
diameter of the heart. There is fullness of indistinct pulmonary 
vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, 
beyond that which would be expected with poor inspiration on a 
portable examination. 

Cardiac Cath (___): 
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed 
no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LMCA 
was free 
from angiographic disease.  The LAD had mild plaquing. The 
ostial 
diagonal branch demonstrated 60% focal stenosis.  The LCx was a 
small 
vessel giving rise to a large OM1 (functionally a ramus 
intermedis) and 
four other tiny OMs.  The RCA was a large dominant vessel with 
mild 
plaquing. 
  
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 
___ F with multiple medical problems and recent complaints of 
worsening dyspnea on exertion who presents for planned CCU 
admission for aspirin desensitization prior to cardiac 
catheterization for further work up of DOE.  
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# Diastolic CHF: Pt has diastolic CHF based on cardiac cath, and 
given the absence of coronary disease, this is likely the cause 
of her exertional dyspnea. This is consistent with her 
longstanding history of HTN. She was diuresed with IV lasix and 
her home lasix was increased to 20mg po daily. She was also 
started on metoprolol succinate 50 mg qday and lisinopril 2.5mg 
po qday. At the time of discharge she was asymptomatic and her 
weight was 64.5kg.  
.
# Pulmonary HTN: Pt has significant pulmonary HTN (PA pressure 
52/___) based on cardiac cath, and this is likely also 
contributing to exertional dyspnea. This is likely ___ her left 
sided diastolic CHF, but given history of bronchiectasis, cannot 
rule out a primary pulmonary component to her elevated PA 
pressures. She was discarged on ACEI, diuretic and beta blocker 
per above. 
.
# ASA Allergy: Pt underwent successful ASA desensitization. ASA 
reaction is documented as urticaria/angioedema, but during 
desensitization she only experienced pruritis without other 
manifestations of hypersensitivity. She was desensitized per 
___ protocol without indicent and should continue taking ASA 
81 indefinately to prevent recurrence of hypersensitivity.  
.
# HTN: Her metoprolol tartrate 25mg qday was changed to 
metoprolol succinate 50mg qday. Her lasix was increaed to 10mg 
qday and she was started on lisinopril 2.5mg qday. Her BP was 
well controlled on this regemin while hospitalzied, but her 
medications should be further titrated by her PCP as an 
outpatient.
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.
# DIABETES: Last HbA1c in ___ was 5.7%. Currently off all 
medication. She was covered with ISS while in house her BG was 
well controlled
.  
# ANEMIA: Her home folic acid and B12 were continued. Her Hct 
remained stable in the low/normal range throughout her hospital 
course and no intervention was undertaken.
.  
# JOINT PAIN: Multifactorial (has RA vs. PMR and osteoarthritis 
by history, also status post bilateral total knee arthroplasty). 
She was continued on her home Voltaren 1% gel, sulfasalazine and 
Ca/Vit D and her pain was well controlled on tylenol prn. Pt is 
followed by rheum, who will see her as an outpatient. 
.  
# VASOACTIVE SYMPTOMS S/P MENOPAUSE: She was continued on her 
home Premarin 0.9 mg PO daily; should follow up with PCP 
regarding weaning estrogen. 
.  
# PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES: She was contined on her home mirtazapine 
and venlafaxine. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: She was discahrged home with Cardiology, 
PCP, ___ and Allergy/Immunology follow up. Dietary teaching 
was performed regarding the importance of low Na diet and 
warning signs about fluid overload.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a cardiac catheterization to test for 
heart problems that were causing your breathing trouble and 
chest pain. You did not have any significant blockages in your 
heart arteries but we did find that you had too much fluid in 
your body that wa affecting your breathing and making you tired. 
We gave you some intravenous furosemide to get rid of the fluid 
and will have you take 20 mg of furosemide daily instead of 10 
mg to keep the fluid from coming back. If your breathing worsens 
again, this means that the fluid is coming back. Weigh yourself 
every morning, call Dr. ___ weight goes up more than 3 
lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. It is very important that 
you avoid salt in your cooking and check the ingredients for 
high salt content. You can have about 2000mg of salt daily. 
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. Increase furosemide to 20 mg daily
2. Stop taking metoprolol tartrate, take metoprolol succinate 
instead once a day
3. Start aspirin 81 mg daily, do not stop taking this medicine 
unless Dr. ___ you to. 
4. Start lisinopril 2.5 mg daily to lower your blood pressure.
