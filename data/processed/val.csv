SUMMARY STATEMENT
====================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with PMHx High grade lymphoma 
with burkitt's features s/p cycle 6 R-EPOCH, HTN, HLD, DM, and 
gout who presents with abdominal bloating and weight loss at 
home, found to have refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
confirmed on gastric biopsy, initiated on RICE therapy. His 
course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, ___, and one 
episode of hematuria. Problems addressed during his 
hospitalization are as follows:

#Recurrent Burkitts-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
Patient with high grade lymphoma with Burkitt like features 
refractory to 6 cycles of EPOCH-R therapy last given ___. 
Previously had IGH/MYC rearrangement and no evidence of BCL2 or 
BCL6 rearrangements. Initially presented with weight loss and 
abdominal bloating, CT AP demonstrating gastric thickening s/p 
EGD with biopsy demonstrating high grade B-cell lymphoma (CD20, 
CD10 positive; CD5 negative; ___ ISH negative; Ki-67 
proliferation index near 100%). Subsequent FISH and cytogenetics 
demonstrating pending. Initiated ICE therapy Cycle 1 
___ with rituximab administration ___. 
Received filgrastim ___. Initiated acyclovir for 
prophylaxis. Developed ___ likely in setting of Ifosfamide 
administration (see ___ below), otherwise tolerated with no 
issues. 

#Febrile neutropenia:
Tmax ___, otherwise remained afebrile, no source of 
infection identified. No localizing symptoms other than nasal 
erythema suspicious for HSV which he has had in the past, 
however on acyclovir, improved. CXR clear, elevation in alk phos 
(most likely medication effect), PICC line without suspicion for 
infection, no evidence of cellulitis, fungal markers negative, 
blood and urine cultures negative. Completed 7 day course of IV 
cefepime, discontinued when ___>500 over 3 days.

___:
Cr elevated over several days (Cr peak 2.1; baseline 1.1-1.2). 
Etiology most likely ATN supported by urine with fragmented 
granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells. Likely 
developed kidney injury from large volume autodiuresis (up to 
-3.5L over 24H) and medication effect causing tubular injury 
(Ifosfamide). Cr normalized with IVF to keep net fluid balance 
even. Given sodium bicarbonate for acidosis. Of note, in ___ 
developed tumor lysis syndrome at outside hospital (Cr peak 8.4, 
UA 515), renal biopsy with ATN/AIN requiring temporary dialysis. 


#Hematuria with blood clots:
Reported blood clot in urine x1, otherwise asymptomatic. UA 
unremarkable with no evidence of hematuria x2. Resolved 
spontaneously with no intervention. Possibly from ifosfamide 
administration, of note also has bladder mass on CT performed at 
___.

#Guaiac positive stool:
Intermittent melena on admission, resolved with initiation of 
PPI. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#Anemia:
Hg ___, likely due to lymphoma and bone marrow suppression from 
chemotherapy. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#HTN:
In setting of ATN and large volume autidiuresis, reduced home 
labetalol(decreased from 300 to 200 BID) and home amlodipine 
(decreased from 10 to 5 QD). Remained normotensive with this 
dose reduction.

#Gout: 
Continued home allopurinol

#DM:
Continued home NPH 7 qAM, and ISS, held home glyburide

#Moderate malnutrition:
On presentation reported 3.6% weight loss over 2 weeks. Received 
glucerna BID in between meals.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
[] continue to monitor weight [weight at discharge: 68.3 kg, 
weight at admission: 71.35 kg]
[] continue to monitor hematuria, melena 
[] consider initiation of SSRI

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M w/ ESRD s/p DCD renal transplant 
in ___ on cellcept/tacro, s/p MVC ___ yrs ago w/ chronic 
neurogenic bladder c/b recurrent UTIs, HTN, diabetes, and recent 
prolonged hospitalization for septic shock c/b ischemic colitis, 
presenting with abdominal pain. He underwent aggressive bowel 
regimen with large stool burden and had a colonoscopy concerning 
for ischemic colitis. He was seen by CRS with no recommended 
surgical intervention. Course was complicated by UTI with MDR 
e.coli, and he underwent pMIBI which did not identify any 
reversible perfusion defect per cardiology consultation team. He 
will follow up with CRS, cardiology, and transplant nephrology 
as an outpatient and is discharged to skilled nursing facility.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#. Abdominal Pain 
#. Hx of Ischemic/C.Diff Colitis
Patient with imaging initially significant for improving 
colitis, persistent proctocolitis, and large stool burden. 
Abdominal pain though to be most likely ___ to large stool 
burden, so was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen. CRS was 
consulted without acute surgical need. ID was consulted as he 
was scheduled to followup with them as outpatient, who d/c'd his 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl which he was on from his previous course. 
The patient was scheduled for outpatient flex sig, so GI was 
consulted to perform in house. His prep was successful and he 
underwent a full colonoscopy, which was significant for erosion, 
ulceration and strictures, concerning for ischemic colitis, 
along with ? of diverticuli or fistulas. He underwent a CT with 
rectal contrast with no signs of fistulas. He was again seen by 
CRS with no plan for surgical intervention. He was kept on 
standing bowel regimen. MMF dose was decreased due to initial 
concern for MMF colitis but due to low suspicion on colonoscopy 
findings for MMF toxicity this was increased to 500 bid from 
250.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

You were here because you were having abdominal pain. You were 
seen by the gastrointestinal (GI) team and the colorectal team, 
who felt that you had a lot of extra stool that was causing the 
pain. You also had a colonoscopy, which showed ulcers and narrow 
areas of your colon. Fortunately, the colorectal surgery team 
did not think you needed surgery. You had a stress test which 
did not show any active areas of decrease blood flow to your 
heart, and the cardiology team concluded that you would not 
benefit from an invasive procedure to look at the vessels of 
your heart. You were also found to have a urinary tract 
infection, for which you are discharged on a course of 
antibiotics through your PICC which will continue through ___. 
You will continue oral vancomycin through ___ to prevent c. diff 
infection.

When you leave, it is important you take your medications as 
prescribed. It is also important you keep your appointments as 
listed below. You will follow-up with cardiology and colorectal 
surgery as an outpatient as well as transplant nephrology.

We wish you the best of luck!

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ male with history of renal transplant in ___ who 
presents with subacute kidney injury.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury - 
The patient was admitted with a Cr of 5.3. Renal U/S showed 
moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis, which had worsened over the 
past year. FeNa was 5.5%. Urine culture negative on two 
occasions. The patient had good urine output. A Cudet foley 
catheter was placed with good return. Both Urology and 
transplant nephrology were involved in the case. The etiology of 
the renal failure was thought to be multifactorial: ATN ___ 
recent illness with significant nausea/vomiting during which 
time he continued to take Lasix and losartan with obstructive 
component because the patient had stopped taking terazosin. The 
patient's Cr did not improve during ___ hospitalization. His K, 
which was intially 5.2 responded to Kayexelate and his potassium 
was stable throughout the admission. A repeat renal ultrasound 
showed progression of the hydronephrosis despite a foley 
catheter in place with good return. Cystogram showed a dilated 
collecting system but no ureteral stricture. The patient was 
discharged with a foley in place and urology follow-up the 
following week. He was also discharged to have his renal lytes 
rechecked and with close nephrology follow-up. Terazosin was 
restarted. Lasix and losartan were stopped with the patient to 
take lasix only every ___ day. 
.
# Hypertension- The patient had persistent hypertension during 
this admission. Losartan was held given acute kidney injury. The 
patient was continued on his home diltiazem and nadolol. 
Hydralazine 25 mg tid was started with good response. 
.
# S/p renal transplant- The patient's immunosuppressive regimen 
with prednisone 4 mg qday and imuran 50 mg qday was contiued as 
was calcitriol.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin. 
.
# GERD
- continude PPI
.
# BPH- Thought to have contributed to acute kidney injury. 
Terazosin 3 mg bid was started to be uptitrated as an 
outpatient. The patient was discharged with a foley in place and 
urology follow-up. 
.
# ___- patient has had over 4000 lesions removed. Outpatient 
follow-up with dermatology
.
# DVT prophylaxis with subQ heparin. The patient remained full 
code throughout this admission. Contact was with the patient's 
wife, ___ ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___ - 
___ was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for acute kidney failure. We 
placed a foley to help decompress your bladder and kidney 
collecting system. We performed 2 ultrasound studies of your 
kidneys, which both showed swelling and dilation of your kidney 
collecting system. We also performed a cystogram, that did not 
show any damage to the connection between your kidney and 
bladder. Your renal failure was likely caused by a combination 
of medications, dehydration from your recent illness, and 
possibly from an enlarged prostate. You will go home with a 
foley catheter from the hospital and will see a urologist next 
___ to have this foley removed. You will see Dr. ___ 
___ ___. We also started you on a medication to treat your 
enlarged prostate. 
. 
We made the following changes to your medications: 
We changed Lasix to 40 mg every ___ day. 
We changed Gabapentin (Neurontin) to 300 mg each day because of 
your renal function
We STOPPED Cozaar (Losartan). You may be told to restart this 
medication once your kidney function returns to normal. 
We STARTED terazosin 3 mg twice per day for your prostate.
We STARTED hydralazine 25 mg three times per day for high blood 
pressure (this will likely be stopped once you can restart 
Cozaar). 
We STOPPED ciprofloxacin.
. 
It is also very important that you have your renal function labs 
performed on this ___ to be sure there is no 
worsening of your kidney function and to be sure that your 
potassium is still within a normal range. These labs can be 
drawn close to home and should be faxed to your primary care 
doctor at ___#: ___ at fax#

History of Present Illness:
___ female with hx of severe COPD on home oxygen, morbid 
obesity, hx CAD s/p PCI, chronic pseudotumor cerebri, presents 
from OSH where she originally presented for an ___ guided lumbar 
puncture for therapeutic drainage. The patient had lost the keys 
to her portable oxygen tanks and went to an OSH for a 
therapeutic LP without her oxygen. However in waiting for her 
procedure, she developed some chest pain and was noted to be 
hypoxic to the 50% on RA. Her chest pain resolved within minutes 
and she was placed on 4L oxygen and her O2 sats went up to 87% 
and an ABG was performed and was ___. A CXR was obtained 
and reportedly had evidence of an infiltrate. She was given 
nebulizers, steroids, and moxifloxacin and was transfered to 
___ for ___ guided lumbar puncture.
.
In the ___ ED, initial VS were: 98 85 159/89 18 91% 4L. She 
received labs notable for lactate 2.4, HCT 54, HCO3 32 and blood 
cultures were sent. CXR showed hyperexpansion without clear 
evidence of an infiltrate or pulmonary edema. She received a CT 
head which was consistent with pseudotumor cerebri. She received 
duonebs and vancomycin was added to her antibiotic regimen. 
Oxygen saturations were in the ___ on 4L NC. She reports her 
baseline oxygenation saturation is 82%. She was admitted to the 
MICU for oxygen monitoring while she awaits ___ guided LP. Access 
includes 2 PIV 20G on the right. 
.  
On arrival to the MICU, she temporarily endorsed mild chest 
heaviness, no radiation, no associated SOB, nausea or 
paresthesias. This pain quickly resolved without intervention. 
She has had chronic headaches, worse lately despite recently 
starting acetazolamide, associated with peripheral vision loss 
and visual scotomas. She is taking vicodin as needed for the 
pain. Denies cough, increased sputum production, wheezing or 
fever/chills. No sick contacts. She feels her breathing is at 
baseline.  
.
Prior to transfer on the floor, the patient reports improvement 
in her breathing and endorses continued headache that involves 
the back of her head and is throbbing in quality. When the 
headaches are at their worst they are associated with blurry 
vision and ""floaters."" She has also noted some crusting and 
dryness of her eyes that she has been treating with blephamide. 
She also endorses increased lethargy, fatigue, and sleepiness 
that she attributes to the narcotic medicine that she has been 
taking to manage her headaches. She has also has reportedly been 
more confused recently, not recounting recent events and has 
been taking less POs. At this time, she denied any fevers, 
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or abdominal 
pain. Of note, her O2 saturations on 2L oxygen are in the high

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with severe COPD on 2L home oxygen, chronic 
pseudotumor cerebri, with underlying chronic hypoxia, presents 
from OSH with hypoxia and headaches here for ___ guided lumbar 
puncture for therapeutic drainage.  
.  
#Hypoxia: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have O2 sats 
in the mid-80s on 4L. Her CXR demonstrated evidence of mild CHF 
and she was diuresed with her home dose of lasix and admitted to 
the MICU for oxygen monitoring. Her acetazolamide was held given 
its potential to exacerbate her hypercarbia. She maintained her 
oxygen saturations and was transferred to the floor where her 
oxygen was weaned to 4L while being treated with her home 
regimen of nebulizers and Spiriva for her history of COPD. Given 
that she had not formally seen a pulmonologist for the workup of 
her hypoxia, she was setup with outpatient follow-up with ___ 
Pulmonary at discharge. It was also felt that the patient likely 
has obstructive sleep apnea given her body habitus, or even some 
hypoventilation syndrome. Given the possible complexity of her 
sleep-breathing patterns, Sleep Medicine recommended that the 
patient follow-up with them in clinic as well, to discuss Sleep 
Study and CPAP/BiPAP.   
.
#Pseudotumor cerebri: Upon admission, the patient complained of 
headaches that were consistent with her history of pseudotumor 
cerebri that was subsequently confirmed on a head-CT. Her 
acetazolamide was held given concern for exacerbating her 
hypercarbia. Throughout her admission, her headaches were stable 
without any visual symptoms and appropriately controlled with 
tylenol and oxycodone. Her aspirin and plavix were held 
(patient's husband reported that he had not given these to her 
X2 weeks given her somnolence on pain meds for her headaches). 
She subsequently received an ___ guided therapeutic LP (___) 
and tolerated it well. Her headaches resolved following her LP 
and aspirin and plavix were restarted. Per the patient, she 
often can go months to years after a therapeutic LP without 
symptoms or need for retapping (last LP in ___. 
.
#Bradycardia: Prior to transfer from the MICU, the patient was 
noted to have HRs in the 40-50s which continued while on the 
floor. She was asymptomatic, and her EKG was notable for sinus 
bradycardia with no conduction defects.  Her metoprolol dose was 
adjusted and her HR increased to the ___ with activity.  She was 
discharged on a lower dose of metoprolol.
.
Inactive Issues:
.
#Eye Crusting: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have 
mild crusting of her left eyelid without any evidence of 
conjunctivitis or blepheritis. She was continued on her home 
blephamide cream and her crusting improved over the course of 
her hospitalization
.  
#CAD and history of MI: During her hospitalization, the patient 
acknowledged some chest heaviness without radiation, dyspnea, 
nausea, or paresthesias that resolved within minutes. Her EKG 
was without ST/T changes and her cardiac enzymes were normal. 
She had no subsequent episodes of chest pain throughout her 
hospitalization and was continued on her home regimen of 
lipitor, metoprolol and imdur. According to records obtained 
from ___ where the patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization in ___, the patient has three Cypher (DES) 
stents in her LAD distribution. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient NEEDS to have outpatient pulmonology follow-up. Her 
pulmonary disease is very poorly controlled at this point and 
she is at risk of rapidly worsening from Cor Pulmonale. This 
information was discussed at length with the patient, who has an 
appointment with ___ Pulmonary. 
- Patient should have outpatient sleep study. She has an 
appointment with ___ Sleep Medicine 
- Please follow-up heart rate as metoprolol dose was adjusted as 
inpatient to 12.5mg BID given bradycardia.
- Patient demonstrates significant interest in smoking 
cessation. QuitWorks and Nicotine patches were provided to the 
patient. She should discuss this with her primary care 
physician, as it will help with her ongoing lung disease
