Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F w/ PMH of presumed alcohol cirrhosis 
here with abdominal pain and increased girth secondary to 
worsening ascites who was discharged with improved pain.

Acute Issues:
#Abdominal pain- likely secondary to increased ascites as there 
was no intraperitoneal disease found on CT scan.  Furthermore 
her pain improved with therapeutic paracentis of 6.5L.  Her 
diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP.

Ascites fluid leak - due to persist fluid leak a suture was 
placed by surgery.  #This was successful in stopping the leak.  
Suture may be removed in approx 10 days from placement on the 
day of discharge.

#Cirrhosis- patient reported receiving her previous care at 
___. When she presented she had evidence of 
large amount of ascites. Normal coags and plateltes and low 
albumin. She had a therapeutic paracentesis -6.5L, and had 
leaking para site on the LLQ that required a figure 8 stitch to 
be placed to stop the leaking. She reported still drinking 
alcohol.  Labs performed here were negative for other sources of 
cirrhosis detectable by lab serology. She had no evidence of 
encephalopathy, no spider angiomas.  Her blood pressure ran low 
and she had mild hyponatremia.  Due to her low blood pressure 
(80s/50s) it was decided to hold her diuretics on discharge and 
that she would followup with her PCP in ___ couple of days to 
repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics at a low dose. 
She was counseled on adhering to a low sodium diet and fluid 
restriction of 2L. Suture to be removed the week of 
___ will have followup in the ___ clinic with 
Dr. ___ on ___. 

#Alcohol use- patient with alcohol use. She had presumed alcohol 
cirrhosis secondary to it.  She was placed on the CIWA scale and 
never scored or showed signs of withdrawal.

#Low blood pressure- patient had blood pressure in the ___. 
She had no orthostaic symptoms and her blood pressure increased 
with sitting and standing.  Her urine was dilute and therefore 
it was felt that this  was not secondary to volume depletion and 
could be due to her underlying liver disease.  

Chronic/transitional Issue:
#Hypertension- patient reported being on HCTZ on admission. This 
was held during her stay and at the time of discharge.  We do 
not anticipate restarting as an outpatient as the pt appears to 
have low BPs chronically from cirrhosis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.
You were admitted to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain. 
You had excessive fluid in your abdomen due to too much salt and 
fluid intake and not taking your diuretics (water pills).  You 
had this fluid removed by paracentesis. You had some continued 
output from the paracentesis site and had a stitch placed. This 
stitch should remain in place for 1 week and removed by a 
clinician at that time.
 It is very important that you avoid salt in your diet and do 
not take in too much fluid. We also recommend that you cut down 
on your alcohol use and seek assistance in ways to do this 
safely if you choose to do it. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, cirrhosis, and ascites. She presented with abdominal pain and was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Her chief complaint was abdominal pain, which was likely secondary to increased ascites. She had a diagnostic paracentesis, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was given zofran and morphine and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

The patient has a past medical history of EtOH abuse, cirrhosis, and ascites. She has allergies to epinephrine. She was prescribed several medications, including lasix, spironolactone, azithromycin, and levofloxacin, but was unsure why she was prescribed these medications.

The patient's physical exam revealed a firm, distended abdomen with a positive fluid wave and diffusely tender to palpation. She had no organomegaly appreciable. Her discharge physical exam revealed a firm, nondistended abdomen with a slight bulge of her umbilical hernia.

The patient's laboratory results showed mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase and normal liver function tests. Her urine analysis showed a trace of protein and a few white blood cells. Her ascites fluid analysis showed a high white blood cell count and a high protein level.

The patient's imaging studies showed low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and a small right pleural effusion on chest X-ray. Her RUQ ultrasound showed a nodular liver with coarsened echotexture and large volume ascites, compatible with hepatic cirrhosis. Her CT abdomen showed a nodular liver with large volume simple ascites and no signs of loculated fluid collection or bowel perforation.

The patient's hospital course was marked by an acute issue of abdominal pain, which was likely secondary to increased ascites. She had a therapeutic paracentesis of 6.5L and had a persisting fluid leak, which was successfully stopped with a suture. She was discharged with improved pain and was advised to follow up with her PCP in a couple of days to repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics. ||endoftext||"

CT Abdomen and Pelvis (IV Contrast):
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. Atelectasis within the lingula is additionally 
noted. 
An amorphous area low attenuation is identified within segment 
IVb of the 
liver. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, 
spleen, 
pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear within normal 
limits. The 
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally. A 
3-cm low- 
attenuation lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney is 
consistent with a simple cyst. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
of the infrarenal abdominal aorta is evident.   
There is thickening of the cecum and significant pericecal 
stranding of 
mesenteric fat. Surgical clips at the site of appendectomy are 
noted. No 
evidence of abscess or loculated fluid. A small amount of free 
fluid in this area, which also tracks down into the pelvis is 
seen. Although the distal ileum is not well distended with oral 
contrast, there is a suggestion of bowel wall thickening/edema 
and stranding of the surrounding mesenteric fat. No organized 
fluid collection is evident, however. There is no evidence of 
bowel obstruction as contrast has passed through to the rectum. 
There is no free air within the abdomen. Although the colon is 
not distended, there is a suggestion of diffuse colonic wall 
thickening. 
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, 
intrapelvic 
loops of small bowel are unremarkable. A Foley balloon is 
present within a 
decompressed bladder. A small amount of free fluid is evident 
within the 
pelvis. Small, bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are 
evident. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Inflammatory process appears to be centered in the ileocecal 
area at the site of recent appendectomy. No organized or 
drainable intra-abdominal fluid collection. Assessment is 
somewhat limited by lack of distal ileal distention with oral 
contrast. A small amount of free fluid and scattered subjacent 
lymph nodes are additionally evident.  
2. Equivocal diffuse colonic wall thickening. This finding 
raises the 
possibility of colitis and and infectious process such as C. 
difficile should be considered.   
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal 
akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the 
basal half of the inferior wall. There is minimal hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %). The estimated cardiac 
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w ischemia. Left pleural effusion. 
.
ECG ___: normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in 
leads III, AVF
.
PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
final blood cultures from ___ (no growth to date)
stool cultures, O&P from ___. SEPSIS:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an outside hospital with 
hypotension, on Levophed with an elevated WBC count of 22.6 on 
admission.  The source of infection was not clear on admission 
and differential included infection from recurrent abscesses at 
appendectomy site or C. Diff colitis.  Other etiology considered 
was reaction to CT contrast.  Was started on Vanocmycin, Zosyn 
and Flagyl in the MICU.  He remained hemodynamically stable and 
afebrile and Levophed was stopped on the day of transfer for 
MAP>65, SvO2 72, CVP 6 and good urine output.  CT showed 
inflammation prior appendectomy site without fluid collection.  
Surgery was consulted and did not recommend surgery.  
Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended 48 hours of IV 
antibiotics for presumed GI infection, then 3 weeks of PO 
antibiotics.  Cultures were obtained on ___ from ___ 
___ and showed no growth to date of blood or urine 
cultures.  Blood and urine cultures collected at ___ 
showed no growth to date.  C. Diff X 3 were negative.  The 
patient continued to do well and was trasnferred to the general 
medical floor on ___.  He was continued on IV antibiotics 
and then changed to PO antibiotics on ___.  He was put on 
Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID and Metronidazole 500mg PO TID and 
was discharged with 16 more days of antibiotics.  He will 
___ with his PCP ___ 1 week.  Another possible etiology for 
his symptoms that was considered was anaphylaxis from PO 
contrast from the CT scan, although this was less likely given 
that he has had PO contrast in the past without problems.  We 
recommended that he see an allergist as an outpatient to assess 
the possibility of an allergic reaction to PO contrast.
.
2. NSTEMI
The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes with a CK 
of 133, CKMB 19, Troponin T 0.29 and T-wave inversions in leads 
III and AVL.  Cardiology was called and thought this was likely 
rate-related demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia due 
to sepsis physiology.  Cardiac enzymes trended down and 
___ ECGs showed no change.  The patient's tachycardia 
improved with IV fluids and antibiotics.  He was asymptomatic 
during his admission.  He was put on telemetry and had no events 
or arrythmias.  An echocardiogram showed global reduced 
function, EF 45% and focal akinesis of basal inferior wall.  
Aspirin 325mg PO qday and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID were started 
for NSTEMI.  Cardiology did not recommend heparin or 
anti-platelet agents.  Cardiology recommended a ___ echo 
and cardiologist appointment within 4 weeks after his acute 
illness had resolved. The patient will have this scheduled with 
his primary care doctor.  He remained asymptomatic with no chest 
pain or signs of clinical heart failure.

who presents with cough and shortness of breath
.  
#  Cough- Patient was recently admitted with similar symptoms at 
___ and was discharged with a course of augmentin and 
doxycycline for CAP, which she completed.  However, prior to 
admission, she developed cough associated with shortness of 
breath so she presented to ___.   In the ED, she was febrile 
with possible early pneumonia on CXR, so she received a dose of 
ceftriaxone.  Given that her WBC was normal, and cough was 
non-productive, the patient was not initially treated for HCAP.  
In addition, she has presented like this in the past and was 
treated for a COPD exacerbation.  On admission, she was started 
on azithromycin, prednisone 60mg daily and nebulizers.  Her 
symptoms improved and oxygen requirement was decreasing.  
However, she developed a fever on ___ so she was started on 
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, given recent hospital 
discharge.  She was weaned off oxygen and worked well with 
physical therapy.  Urine legionella was negative.  Blood and 
urine cultures were negative.  Sputum culture was contaminated 
with normal respiratory flora.  The patient completed an 8 day 
course of antibiotics- vancomycin 1gm q48hours, Cefepime 1g q24 
hours via ___ line.  She is being discharged on a prednisone 
taper starting at 30mg daily.  On discharge, cough, shortness of 
breath and oxygen requirement had resolved.  She was able to 
ambulate with no shortness of breath.  The patient was afebrile 
from ___ until discharge, had a normal WBC count and looked 
well.  
.  
#  Fever- Likely secondary to pneumonia.  She lacked other 
symptoms of influenza (myalgias, etc).  Patient's cultures were 
negative.  UA was negative for UTI.  
.
#  COPD- Patient improved with azithromycin, nebulizers and 
steroids.  She was weaned off oxygen and is being discharged on 
a prednisone taper, starting at 30mg daily for 14 additional 
days of therapy
.  
#  Atrial fibrillation- Continued home amiodarone and 
metoprolol.  Heart rate was regular and was well-controlled.  
Her INR trended up to 4.3 so she was cut down from 2mg 3x/week 
to 0.5 or 1.0mg daily (pending INR) given that she is on 
antibiotics and amiodarone.  As mentioned, her INR peaked at 4.3 
but then trended down.  We resumed her at 2mg daily on ___ 
when INR was 1.7.  Subsequent trend was 1.7 -> 1.5 -> 1.6.  She 
received 2mg of coumadin on ___.  We have 
instructed her to resume her prior regimen on discharge meaning 
she will take 2mg on ___ and 1mg on ___.  We also asked the 
patient to have an INR check on ___ and to please fax the 
results to her PCP for instruction on management of coumadin 
dosing.  
.  
#  Diastolic CHF- The patient has a known history of chronic 
diastolic heart failure.  On admission, there were no signs of 
fluid overload on exam.  Her oxygen requirement was attributed 
to pneumonia and COPD exerbation.  Given her elevated creatinine 
on admission, her lasix and lisinopril were initially held.  Her 
creatinine improved so we resumed her lisinopril at 20mg daily.  
By discharge, we resumed home dose of lisinopril.  Once 
creatinine stabilized, home dose of lasix was resumed and 
patient's creatinine remained stable.  She was discharged on 
home dose of lasix 20mg daily and has ___ with Dr. ___ 
on ___.
.
#  CAD- The patient did not present with chest pain.  Her EKGs 
were consistent with prior.  She was continued on her home 
statin and beta-blocker.  
.
#  Hypertension- As mentioned above, her lisinopril was 
initially held given ___ but was resumed at home dose by 
discharge.  She was continued on the remainder of her home 
medications- imdur 30mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg daily.  BP's were remained stable. 
.
#  Numbness- On the last day of admission, patient revealed to 
us that she had been experiencing numbness in her fingertips 
(all of them).  Exam did not demonstrate any sensory or motor 
deficit as patient has ___ strength in all 4 extremities with 
intact sensation bilaterally.  She is not a diabetic.  Other 
possible etiologies include b12 deficiency, radiculopathy, or 
vasculitis.  Given that her symptoms are in both hands with only 
the DIP joint affected, a cervical radiculopathy is unlikely.  
She has no other systemic symptoms suggestive of vasculitis 
(skin changes, fever, chills) and her labwork is benign.  No 
indication for imaging as remainder of neurological exam is 
intact, including gait.  This also could be due to a medication 
as she received IV antibiotics.  B12 level checked and pending 
at the time of discharge, but, given description of symptoms, 
will likely not be the etiology behind this numbness.  We ask 
that the patient's PCP ___ on this issue when she sees the 
patient on ___.
.
