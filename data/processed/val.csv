Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F w/ PMH of presumed alcohol cirrhosis 
here with abdominal pain and increased girth secondary to 
worsening ascites who was discharged with improved pain.

Acute Issues:
#Abdominal pain- likely secondary to increased ascites as there 
was no intraperitoneal disease found on CT scan.  Furthermore 
her pain improved with therapeutic paracentis of 6.5L.  Her 
diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP.

Ascites fluid leak - due to persist fluid leak a suture was 
placed by surgery.  #This was successful in stopping the leak.  
Suture may be removed in approx 10 days from placement on the 
day of discharge.

#Cirrhosis- patient reported receiving her previous care at 
___. When she presented she had evidence of 
large amount of ascites. Normal coags and plateltes and low 
albumin. She had a therapeutic paracentesis -6.5L, and had 
leaking para site on the LLQ that required a figure 8 stitch to 
be placed to stop the leaking. She reported still drinking 
alcohol.  Labs performed here were negative for other sources of 
cirrhosis detectable by lab serology. She had no evidence of 
encephalopathy, no spider angiomas.  Her blood pressure ran low 
and she had mild hyponatremia.  Due to her low blood pressure 
(80s/50s) it was decided to hold her diuretics on discharge and 
that she would followup with her PCP in ___ couple of days to 
repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics at a low dose. 
She was counseled on adhering to a low sodium diet and fluid 
restriction of 2L. Suture to be removed the week of 
___ will have followup in the ___ clinic with 
Dr. ___ on ___. 

#Alcohol use- patient with alcohol use. She had presumed alcohol 
cirrhosis secondary to it.  She was placed on the CIWA scale and 
never scored or showed signs of withdrawal.

#Low blood pressure- patient had blood pressure in the ___. 
She had no orthostaic symptoms and her blood pressure increased 
with sitting and standing.  Her urine was dilute and therefore 
it was felt that this  was not secondary to volume depletion and 
could be due to her underlying liver disease.  

Chronic/transitional Issue:
#Hypertension- patient reported being on HCTZ on admission. This 
was held during her stay and at the time of discharge.  We do 
not anticipate restarting as an outpatient as the pt appears to 
have low BPs chronically from cirrhosis.
 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
1. Spironolactone 50 mg PO DAILY 
2. Levofloxacin 250 mg PO Q24H

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.
You were admitted to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain. 
You had excessive fluid in your abdomen due to too much salt and 
fluid intake and not taking your diuretics (water pills).  You 
had this fluid removed by paracentesis. You had some continued 
output from the paracentesis site and had a stitch placed. This 
stitch should remain in place for 1 week and removed by a 
clinician at that time.
 It is very important that you avoid salt in your diet and do 
not take in too much fluid. We also recommend that you cut down 
on your alcohol use and seek assistance in ways to do this 
safely if you choose to do it. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, cirrhosis, and ascites. She presented with abdominal pain and was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Her chief complaint was abdominal pain, which was likely secondary to increased ascites. She had a diagnostic paracentesis, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was given zofran and morphine and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

The patient has a past medical history of EtOH abuse, cirrhosis, and ascites. She has allergies to epinephrine. She was prescribed several medications, including lasix, spironolactone, azithromycin, and levofloxacin, but was unsure why she was prescribed these medications.

The patient's physical exam revealed a firm, distended abdomen with a positive fluid wave and diffusely tender to palpation. She had no organomegaly appreciable. Her discharge physical exam revealed a firm, nondistended abdomen with a slight bulge of her umbilical hernia.

The patient's laboratory results showed mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase and normal liver function tests. Her urine analysis showed a trace of protein and a few white blood cells. Her ascites fluid analysis showed a high white blood cell count and a high protein level.

The patient's imaging studies showed low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and a small right pleural effusion on chest X-ray. Her RUQ ultrasound showed a nodular liver with coarsened echotexture and large volume ascites, compatible with hepatic cirrhosis. Her CT abdomen showed a nodular liver with large volume simple ascites and no signs of loculated fluid collection or bowel perforation.

The patient's hospital course was marked by an acute issue of abdominal pain, which was likely secondary to increased ascites. She had a therapeutic paracentesis of 6.5L and had a persisting fluid leak, which was successfully stopped with a suture. She was discharged with improved pain and was advised to follow up with her PCP in a couple of days to repeat her blood pressure and restart diuretics. ||endoftext||"

who presents with cough and shortness of breath
.  
#  Cough- Patient was recently admitted with similar symptoms at 
___ and was discharged with a course of augmentin and 
doxycycline for CAP, which she completed.  However, prior to 
admission, she developed cough associated with shortness of 
breath so she presented to ___.   In the ED, she was febrile 
with possible early pneumonia on CXR, so she received a dose of 
ceftriaxone.  Given that her WBC was normal, and cough was 
non-productive, the patient was not initially treated for HCAP.  
In addition, she has presented like this in the past and was 
treated for a COPD exacerbation.  On admission, she was started 
on azithromycin, prednisone 60mg daily and nebulizers.  Her 
symptoms improved and oxygen requirement was decreasing.  
However, she developed a fever on ___ so she was started on 
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, given recent hospital 
discharge.  She was weaned off oxygen and worked well with 
physical therapy.  Urine legionella was negative.  Blood and 
urine cultures were negative.  Sputum culture was contaminated 
with normal respiratory flora.  The patient completed an 8 day 
course of antibiotics- vancomycin 1gm q48hours, Cefepime 1g q24 
hours via ___ line.  She is being discharged on a prednisone 
taper starting at 30mg daily.  On discharge, cough, shortness of 
breath and oxygen requirement had resolved.  She was able to 
ambulate with no shortness of breath.  The patient was afebrile 
from ___ until discharge, had a normal WBC count and looked 
well.  
.  
#  Fever- Likely secondary to pneumonia.  She lacked other 
symptoms of influenza (myalgias, etc).  Patient's cultures were 
negative.  UA was negative for UTI.  
.
#  COPD- Patient improved with azithromycin, nebulizers and 
steroids.  She was weaned off oxygen and is being discharged on 
a prednisone taper, starting at 30mg daily for 14 additional 
days of therapy
.  
#  Atrial fibrillation- Continued home amiodarone and 
metoprolol.  Heart rate was regular and was well-controlled.  
Her INR trended up to 4.3 so she was cut down from 2mg 3x/week 
to 0.5 or 1.0mg daily (pending INR) given that she is on 
antibiotics and amiodarone.  As mentioned, her INR peaked at 4.3 
but then trended down.  We resumed her at 2mg daily on ___ 
when INR was 1.7.  Subsequent trend was 1.7 -> 1.5 -> 1.6.  She 
received 2mg of coumadin on ___.  We have 
instructed her to resume her prior regimen on discharge meaning 
she will take 2mg on ___ and 1mg on ___.  We also asked the 
patient to have an INR check on ___ and to please fax the 
results to her PCP for instruction on management of coumadin 
dosing.  
.  
#  Diastolic CHF- The patient has a known history of chronic 
diastolic heart failure.  On admission, there were no signs of 
fluid overload on exam.  Her oxygen requirement was attributed 
to pneumonia and COPD exerbation.  Given her elevated creatinine 
on admission, her lasix and lisinopril were initially held.  Her 
creatinine improved so we resumed her lisinopril at 20mg daily.  
By discharge, we resumed home dose of lisinopril.  Once 
creatinine stabilized, home dose of lasix was resumed and 
patient's creatinine remained stable.  She was discharged on 
home dose of lasix 20mg daily and has ___ with Dr. ___ 
on ___.
.
#  CAD- The patient did not present with chest pain.  Her EKGs 
were consistent with prior.  She was continued on her home 
statin and beta-blocker.  
.
#  Hypertension- As mentioned above, her lisinopril was 
initially held given ___ but was resumed at home dose by 
discharge.  She was continued on the remainder of her home 
medications- imdur 30mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg daily.  BP's were remained stable. 
.
#  Numbness- On the last day of admission, patient revealed to 
us that she had been experiencing numbness in her fingertips 
(all of them).  Exam did not demonstrate any sensory or motor 
deficit as patient has ___ strength in all 4 extremities with 
intact sensation bilaterally.  She is not a diabetic.  Other 
possible etiologies include b12 deficiency, radiculopathy, or 
vasculitis.  Given that her symptoms are in both hands with only 
the DIP joint affected, a cervical radiculopathy is unlikely.  
She has no other systemic symptoms suggestive of vasculitis 
(skin changes, fever, chills) and her labwork is benign.  No 
indication for imaging as remainder of neurological exam is 
intact, including gait.  This also could be due to a medication 
as she received IV antibiotics.  B12 level checked and pending 
at the time of discharge, but, given description of symptoms, 
will likely not be the etiology behind this numbness.  We ask 
that the patient's PCP ___ on this issue when she sees the 
patient on ___.

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 91-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of cough and fever. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. She was previously admitted to the hospital with a similar condition and was discharged with a course of antibiotics, which she completed. However, her symptoms persisted, and she presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath. On admission, she was febrile with possible early pneumonia on chest X-ray, and she received a dose of ceftriaxone. Her white blood cell count was normal, and her cough was non-productive, so she was not initially treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was started on azithromycin, prednisone, and nebulizers, and her symptoms improved. ||endoftext||"

Blood Cultures routine and mycolytic NGTD at time of D/C

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended ensure supplementation, 
but pt. did not like ensure and made this clear to nutrition, 
ensure was seen unopened on pt.s tray every morning.
.
#Diarrhea: Likely ___ OI, differential is quite wide: crypto, 
giardia, ___, CMV, C. diff. All previous wkup 
was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

lesion. There were left-right collaterals noted. The LCx was a 
non-dominant vessel without critical lesions. The RCA was a 
dominant 
vessel with origin 20% calcified lesion and mid-segment 90% 
lesion. There was mild distal RCA disease. 
2. There was normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP 120 mmHg 
and DBP 
64 bpm. 
3. Successful stenting of the mid-RCA with 3.0 X 28 mm Cypher 
___ 
___ to 3.25 mm with no residual stenosis (see PTCA 
comments for 
detail). 
4. No demonstrable critical ostial RCA disease as documented by 
MLD on 
IVUS. 
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with Cypher DES. 
.
___ Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There 
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the aortic regurgitation is reduced; other 
findings are similar.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with a PMH of HTN, 
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia who presents with an 
inferior STEMI. 
.  
#. CAD: The patient presented with chest pain and was found to 
have an inferior STEMI on EKG. The patient was taken emergently 
for cardiac catheterization on ___, during which time a ___ 
___ was placed in the RCA to a mid-segment 90% lesion. 
Moderately severe diffuse disease was noted in the mid-segment 
of the LAD and at the bifurcation of D1;this was poorly suitable 
for PCI because of the very diffuse and bifurcation disease. The 
patient tolerated cardiac cath very well, with no recurrence of 
chest pain during her hospital course. Peak CK was in the 170s, 
EKG changes were resolving post-cath. ___ Echo showed no 
evidence of systolic dysfunction or WMA. The patient was 
monitored on telemetry with no significant events. She was 
continued on pravastatin 80mg daily, ASA 325mg, and a BB. Plavix 
was started for duration of at least 12months. ACEI was not 
added given that there was no evidence of any systolic 
dysfunction on echo. The patient was advised that she would need 
additional stress testing in ___ weeks to further evaluate 
cardiac status. Given diffuse disease, she may be a candidate 
for CABG in the future.
.
#. Pump: The patient had mild diastolic dysfunction on ___ echo 
in setting of post-MI. There was no systolic dysfunction or wall 
motion abnormality seen on echo. She was discharged on decreased 
dose of lasix (20mg daily), which was initially started for 
history ___ swelling by her PCP. 
.  
#. Rhythm: The patient was in NSR with no acute issues. She was 
continued on metoprolol while inhouse, and was discharged on 
home dose of atenolol upon discharge.
.  
#. Borderline diabetes: The patient had HbA1c of 5.8% with good 
glycemic control with diet-modification. 
.
#. Chronic pain/fibromyalgia: The patient was continued on 
dilaudid prn.
.  
#. RLE pain: The patient was continued on home dose of 
neurontin.
.
#. The patient was discharged on ___ in good condition, VSS, 
ambulating well, CP-free. She was advised to follow-up with her 
cardiologist and PCP shortly after discharge.

Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 64-year-old female who presented with an inferior STEMI. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis, chronic pain syndrome, depression, and bilateral cataracts. She has a family history of premature coronary artery disease in her father, who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. 

The patient's allergies include penicillins and ibuprofen. She was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of chest pain and was found to have an 80% stenosis at the bifurcation of the LAD and OM, which was too difficult to stent due to concern for jailing the artery. She also had a 90% lesion to the mid RCA, which was stented with a DES. 

The patient's medications at discharge include ASA, morphine, lopressor, heparin, plavix, and integrallin. Her physical examination was normal, with no signs of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Her laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated troponin and creatine kinase levels. 

The patient's diagnosis is two-vessel coronary artery disease, with successful stenting of the mid-RCA with a Cypher DES. Her echocardiogram showed normal left atrial size, left ventricular wall thickness, and regional/global systolic function, with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. ||endoftext||"
