CT Abdomen and Pelvis (IV Contrast):
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. Atelectasis within the lingula is additionally 
noted. 
An amorphous area low attenuation is identified within segment 
IVb of the 
liver. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, 
spleen, 
pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear within normal 
limits. The 
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally. A 
3-cm low- 
attenuation lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney is 
consistent with a simple cyst. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
of the infrarenal abdominal aorta is evident.   
There is thickening of the cecum and significant pericecal 
stranding of 
mesenteric fat. Surgical clips at the site of appendectomy are 
noted. No 
evidence of abscess or loculated fluid. A small amount of free 
fluid in this area, which also tracks down into the pelvis is 
seen. Although the distal ileum is not well distended with oral 
contrast, there is a suggestion of bowel wall thickening/edema 
and stranding of the surrounding mesenteric fat. No organized 
fluid collection is evident, however. There is no evidence of 
bowel obstruction as contrast has passed through to the rectum. 
There is no free air within the abdomen. Although the colon is 
not distended, there is a suggestion of diffuse colonic wall 
thickening. 
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, 
intrapelvic 
loops of small bowel are unremarkable. A Foley balloon is 
present within a 
decompressed bladder. A small amount of free fluid is evident 
within the 
pelvis. Small, bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are 
evident. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Inflammatory process appears to be centered in the ileocecal 
area at the site of recent appendectomy. No organized or 
drainable intra-abdominal fluid collection. Assessment is 
somewhat limited by lack of distal ileal distention with oral 
contrast. A small amount of free fluid and scattered subjacent 
lymph nodes are additionally evident.  
2. Equivocal diffuse colonic wall thickening. This finding 
raises the 
possibility of colitis and and infectious process such as C. 
difficile should be considered.   
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal 
akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the 
basal half of the inferior wall. There is minimal hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %). The estimated cardiac 
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w ischemia. Left pleural effusion. 
.
ECG ___: normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in 
leads III, AVF
.
PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
final blood cultures from ___ (no growth to date)
stool cultures, O&P from ___. SEPSIS:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an outside hospital with 
hypotension, on Levophed with an elevated WBC count of 22.6 on 
admission.  The source of infection was not clear on admission 
and differential included infection from recurrent abscesses at 
appendectomy site or C. Diff colitis.  Other etiology considered 
was reaction to CT contrast.  Was started on Vanocmycin, Zosyn 
and Flagyl in the MICU.  He remained hemodynamically stable and 
afebrile and Levophed was stopped on the day of transfer for 
MAP>65, SvO2 72, CVP 6 and good urine output.  CT showed 
inflammation prior appendectomy site without fluid collection.  
Surgery was consulted and did not recommend surgery.  
Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended 48 hours of IV 
antibiotics for presumed GI infection, then 3 weeks of PO 
antibiotics.  Cultures were obtained on ___ from ___ 
___ and showed no growth to date of blood or urine 
cultures.  Blood and urine cultures collected at ___ 
showed no growth to date.  C. Diff X 3 were negative.  The 
patient continued to do well and was trasnferred to the general 
medical floor on ___.  He was continued on IV antibiotics 
and then changed to PO antibiotics on ___.  He was put on 
Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID and Metronidazole 500mg PO TID and 
was discharged with 16 more days of antibiotics.  He will 
___ with his PCP ___ 1 week.  Another possible etiology for 
his symptoms that was considered was anaphylaxis from PO 
contrast from the CT scan, although this was less likely given 
that he has had PO contrast in the past without problems.  We 
recommended that he see an allergist as an outpatient to assess 
the possibility of an allergic reaction to PO contrast.
.
2. NSTEMI
The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes with a CK 
of 133, CKMB 19, Troponin T 0.29 and T-wave inversions in leads 
III and AVL.  Cardiology was called and thought this was likely 
rate-related demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia due 
to sepsis physiology.  Cardiac enzymes trended down and 
___ ECGs showed no change.  The patient's tachycardia 
improved with IV fluids and antibiotics.  He was asymptomatic 
during his admission.  He was put on telemetry and had no events 
or arrythmias.  An echocardiogram showed global reduced 
function, EF 45% and focal akinesis of basal inferior wall.  
Aspirin 325mg PO qday and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID were started 
for NSTEMI.  Cardiology did not recommend heparin or 
anti-platelet agents.  Cardiology recommended a ___ echo 
and cardiologist appointment within 4 weeks after his acute 
illness had resolved. The patient will have this scheduled with 
his primary care doctor.  He remained asymptomatic with no chest 
pain or signs of clinical heart failure.
.
3. EOSINOPHILIA
The patient's WBCs trended down from admission from 22.6 to 
11.8.  He had 23% bands on admission which resolved by 
discharge.  His eosinophil count was 0 on admission, however on 
___ he had 32% eosinophils, on ___ had 38% eosinophils, and 
on ___ had 36% eosinophils.  This corresponds to an absolute 
eosinophil count of 3680 on ___, 4294 on ___, and 4248 on 
___.  He had no signs of drug reaction, no fevers, skin rashes 
or other symptoms.  His diarrhea had improved over the course of 
admission but was still having ___ bowel movements per day.  His 
stool was checked for C. Diff and was negative X 3.  Ova and 
parasites and fecal stool cultures were pending at the time of 
discharge.  It was recommended that he see an allergist for 
discussion and testing for reaction to PO contrast from the CT 
scan.
.
4. DIARRHEA
Most likely etiology is antibiotic-associated as the patient has 
been on antibiotics off and on for the past several weeks.  His 
diarrhea was at times watery, but improved through admission and 
was described as loose stool at the time of discharge.  
Clostridium Difficile was checked X 3 and was negative.  He was 
discharged with Cipro and Flagyl for his antibiotic regimen.  He 
will ___ with his PCP with any further problems.  His 
final stool cultures are still pending at the time of discharge.
.
5. ANXIETY
The patient was anxious during his hospitalization regarding his 
medical condition and etiology of his sepsis.  He was given 
Ativan 0.5mg PRN for anxiety symptoms.  He was given Trazodone 
25mg PO qHS to help with sleep.  
.
6. PROPHYLAXIS
Mr. ___ was given SC Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  He was 
able to tolerate a regular diet on ___.  
.
His symptoms improved and he was discharged with close PCP 
___ and instructions to ___ with cardiology as 
arranged by his PCP.  He was also recommended to see an 
allergist on discharge for ___ of this episode as a 
potential reaction to PO contrast from the CT scan.

Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ with a history of MI (___), CHF (EF 55-60% ___, GI bleed 
s/p ileostomy c/b bowel obstructions, CKD who was transferred to 
___ from OSH for L sided pneumonia and pleural effusion, 
admitted to MICU for medical management of left pleural 
effusion, hypotension (low at baseline), ___ on CKD, and 
electrolyte derangement. 
 
# L Pleural Effusion - Etiology was considered in setting of 
pneumonia (leukocytosis with left shift, cough, though afebrile) 
vs. malignancy vs. CHF exacerbation. Pleural fluid studies were 
consistent with exudative effusion (elevated LDH, fluid/serum 
protein .46), making infectious etiology most likely. Patient 
initially received CTX/Azithro at OSH. Given GI symptoms in 
setting of slight hyponatremia, we sent Legionella antigen, 
which were negative. In the MICU we continued CTX and 
Azithromycin. CT chest showed loculated non hemorrhagic 
effusions. No evidence of occult malignancy. Pleural fluid was 
sent for cytology which was negative. 

# Shock - Patient was initially hypotensive to SBPs ___. 
Distributive is most likely in setting of pulmonary infection. 
Lactate was normal. Pressures become stable with SBPs ___ 
s/p Albumin 25g IV in the ED. Cardiogenic etiology is less 
likely given normal TTE in ___. We continued to treat infection 
as described above.   
 
# Congestive Heart Failure - EF 55-60% on TTE in ___. Patient 
has been taking Lasix 40mg PO TID at home. BNP 28329 (patient 
does have CKD, 797 in ___. She was volume overloaded on exam 
(marked JVD and acute onset ___. Possibly exacerbated in the 
setting of paroxysmal afib. Diuresis was held due to hypotension 
in the MICU; however, on the floor she was digressed with 40 mg 
IV lasix for a total of 9L net negative for LOS. Her lasix was 
switched to 30 mg of Torsemide on discharge for better 
absorption. 

#Pre renal ___: On admission Creatinine elevated to 2.5. On 
___ it was 1.03, though elevated to 3.3 in ___. Likely 
cardiorenal physiology in setting of CHF and RAS (BUN/Cr 30). 
C/b hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and ACD. She 
was diuresed and her Cr improved to normal with discharge of 
0.9. She did have persistently low bicarb that improved with 
supplementation. 

# Atrial fibrillation - CHA2DS2-VASc 5 - Patient managed on 
nadolol at home. She had been started on Eliquis ___, but 
discontinued due to GIB. Patient reports increased palpitations 
over the past several days, no dizziness/lightheadedness. 
Metoprolol tartrate 6.25 IV q6h was started in the ICU and her 
metoprolol was switched to PO and uptitrated for better rate 
control. Free T4 and T3 were WNL. She was discharged on 150 XL 
of metoprolol. 
  
#Severe Malnutrition - Pt weighs 99 lbs BMI 13. Based on her 
height, ideal weight is 160 lbs. Chronically underweight and no 
evidence of underlying psychiatric illness and felt to be ___ to 
ABD pain and hyperthyroidism She's had multiple bowel surgeries 
and malabsorption is possible and fecal fat studies are pending 
at time of discharge. Celiac's ruled out. Vitamin D 27 and she 
was started on 1/weekly supplementation w/50k. B12/Folate WNL. 
She should continue with Carnation or Ensure shakes TID. 

 # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis - Pure AG metabolic acidosis 
most likely due to uremia. Another possible cause was increased 
acetaminophen ingestion in setting of pain (oxoproline). She was 
not compensating appropriately (pCO2 should be ___, likely 
___ hypoventilation in setting of marked effusion and breathing 
limited by pain (thus also some component of respiratory 
acidosis). Patient received bicarbonate in the ED. Acidosis 
began to improve with improvement in her shock state.  

 # Hyperkalemia - Likely in setting of CKD, exacerbated by 
acidosis. Patient was given Insulin/Dextrose and Calcium 
Gluconate in ED for K of 5.9. Patient received an EKG without 
peaked T waves. Her potassium began to trend toward normal.   

 # Hyperphosphatemia - Chronic issue in setting of CKD, patient 
also has hypocalcemia.  

 # Hypocalcemia - Corrected Ca 7.6. Secondary PTH likely given 
CKD. In setting of hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia and worsening renal 
function. 
 
 # Hyperthyroidism - Patient reportedly had thyroid US within 
last 6mo. R>L thyroid enlargement, which she says has been 
increasing since US.  Patient was continued on her home 
methimazole of 20 mg. 
 
 # Anemia - Patient has known CKD. There may be some component 
of nutritional deficiency, poor PO intake, s/p ileostomy. 
Patient did not require transfusion in the unit or on the 
medicine floor.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came to us with shortness of breath and we found that you 
likely had a pneumonia and a loculated pleural effusion. Our 
Thoracic surgeons drained the fluid and added a chest tube which 
drained the remaining fluid. A repeat CT shows no pneumonia or 
signs of malignancy. We had endocrine see you who recommended 
seeing an ophthalmologist for your hyperthyroidism. We removed 
nearly 8 liters of fluid from you for a heart failure 
exacerbation. We are changing your Lasix to Toresemide which is 
better absorbed. We are discharging you on 30 mg daily. Please 
follow up with your cardiologist for labs and adjustment of the 
dose. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you the best!
Your ___ Team.  
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 64-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain. She has a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperthyroidism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and chronic kidney disease. She is allergic to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 

The patient's presenting symptoms included worsening left-sided pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea, as well as increasing bilateral leg edema. She also experienced nausea, vomiting, and decreased oral intake. 

The patient underwent a chest tube and thoracentesis, which resulted in significant improvement in her dyspnea and oxygen saturation. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and pleural effusion, and was treated with antibiotics and other medications. 

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and she was able to breathe comfortably. She was advised to continue taking her medications as prescribed and to follow up with her primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||"

gall bladder lumen, without stones or gallbladder wall 
thickening. 
PANCREAS: Fatty infiltration of the pancreas seen.  There is no 
evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  
There is no peripancreatic stranding. 
SPLEEN: Splenomegaly is unchanged.  The spleen shows normal 
attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. 
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape. 
URINARY: 1.1 cm right upper pole cortical hypodensity (02:27) is 
unchanged. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of stones or 
hydronephrosis. There are no urothelial lesions in the kidneys 
or ureters. There is no perinephric abnormality. 
GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a small hiatal hernia.  Gastrostomy 
tube tip is in the jejunum.  The patient is status post 
ileocecectomy.  Lack of wall to wall filling of the distal small 
bowel and subsequent apparent wall thickening is likely due to 
mixing artifact. Distal small bowel loops are somewhat dilated, 
up to 3.2 cm, however contrast material is seen in the ascending 
colon and there is air and stool in the colon more distally. 
Colon and rectum are within normal limits.  Prominent mesenteric 
lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT size threshold for 
lymphadenopathy. 
RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy. 
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is 
moderate calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great 
abdominal arteries.  There is a replaced right hepatic artery. 
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. 
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Penile calcifications are again seen.   
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: 
There is no evidence of suspicious lesions.  Osteopenia is 
noted. Multilevel vertebroplasty and right femoral hardware are 
unchanged.  Old gastrostomy tube tract is seen. Right inguinal 
hernia containing fat is again seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Distal small bowel loops are mildly dilated, but enteric 
contrast is seen in the ascending colon and there is air and 
stool in the colon more distally, more suggestive of mild ileus 
rather than bowel obstruction. 
2. Lack of wall to wall filling with oral contrast of the distal 
small bowel and resultant apparent wall thickening is likely due 
to mixing artifact. 
3. The common bile duct measures up to 1.2 cm without evidence 
of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.  Pneumobilia and mild 
intrahepatic biliary dilation are again seen, consistent with 
prior sphincterotomy. 
4. Splenomegaly is unchanged. 
5. 1.1 cm right renal hypodensity is unchanged.  Continued 
attention is recommended on future exams. 

___ 2:46 ___ ESOPHAGUS
FINDINGS:  
Esophagus was not dilated and no extrinsic mass was identified.  
The esophageal mucosa appears normal. 
The primary peristaltic wave was broken in the mid esophagus 
with many tertiary contractions.  An 13 mm barium tablet was 
administered with a few seconds of hold up in the lower 
esophagus, reproducing the patient's symptomatology.  The pill 
passed into the stomach uneventfully with termination of the 
patient's symptoms. 
Limited visualization of the stomach is unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Esophageal dysmotility with prominent tertiary waves, 
consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm.
2.  The patient's symptomatology was reproduced momentarily 
while the barium tablet passed through the gastroesophageal 
junction. 

___ 10:41 AM CHEST (PA & LAT)   
FINDINGS:  
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is a right-sided 
PICC line with tip in the distal SVC.  There is volume loss/ 
infiltrate in the left lower lobe that is new compared to prior 
again seen and more conspicuous than on the prior study are 
multiple mildly dilated loops of bowel.  The patient had a 
contrast-enhanced CT 1 day ago and therefore there is contrast 
outlining many of these loops of bowel.  However with unusual is 
that in many areas it appears that both the inside and outside 
of the bowel wall is visualized.  There is no other evidence of 
free air and therefore this is likely an artifact of the manner 
in which the contrast has been distributed   
IMPRESSION:  
Volume loss/ infiltrate in the left lower lobe mildly dilated 
loops of small bowel with unusual appearance to the bowel wall.  
A followup upright film to exclude free air would be helpful 

___ 1:03 ___ ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)   
FINDINGS:  
Again seen is contrast outlining bowel loops.  At this point in 
time most of contrast is in the colon.  There are multiple 
air-fluid levels in the small bowel which is nondilated.  A 
gastric tube is visualized pneumobilia is present no free air is 
identified   
IMPRESSION:  
Ileus versus partial SBO 

___ 3:44 ___ UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT   
FINDINGS:  
There is normal flow with respiratory variation in the bilateral 
subclavian veins. 
The right internal jugular and axillary veins are patent and 
compressible with transducer pressure. 
The right brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins are patent, 
compressible with transducer pressure and show normal color flow 
and augmentation.  A PICC is seen in a right brachial vein.   
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper 
extremity. 

PATHOLOGY

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of diabetes 
type 2 uncontrolled complicated by neuropathy, Crohn's disease 
s/p ileocecectomy and multiple laparotomies for SBO, chronic 
diarrhea and recurrent pseudo-obstructions prompting venting 
G-Jtube, admitted ___ w diarrhea and abdominal distention 
thought to represent partial small bowel obstruction, with long 
hospital course course notable for intermittent intolerance of 
tube feeds, subsequently requiring initiation of TPN after long 
discussions with patient and GI service, now tolerating well, 
having regular bowel movements without signs of obstruction or 
diarrhea, discharged home with TPN; 

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Intermittent Small Bowel Obstructions / Diarrhea / Abdominal 
pain / Crohn's Disease / Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth - 
On presentation, the patient had acutely worsened diffuse 
chronic abdominal pain on presentation. Subsequent workup 
supported multifactorial causes including likely intermittent 
partial small bowel obstructions, osmotic diarrhea from dietary 
indiscretions (eating lots of starburst candies) and Crohn's 
disease.  Initial concern was for SBO. He had a CT with PO and 
IV contrast that showed mild ileus. However, there was some 
thickening of the bowel wall that initially raised concern for 
Crohn's flare (on subsequent revised read, the thickening was 
deemed artifact). Subsequently, he had a colonoscopy that showed 
ulceration at his colonic-colonic anastomosis with biopsies 
showing terminal ileum inflammation. Given that the results were 
suggestive of Crohn's, the patient was started on budesonide 9mg 
PO daily. Furthermore, in working up his diarrhea, which 
improved with no oral intake, he was found to have a stool Osm 
gap of 357-2*(70+24.3) = 168, which suggested an osmotic 
diarrhea. When tube feed was initiated (see below), his diarrhea 
worsened to over 10 times overnight. Eventually, given that he 
had a borderline SIBO breath test in the past, he was started on 
rifaximin empirically for SIBO treatment. When he started TPN 
(see below), his diarrhea improved to 4 BMs per day.

# Acute Protein Calorie Malnutrition - Patient with > 20lb weigh 
loss over last 6 months.  He had intermittent symptoms as above, 
but failed trials of starting on tube feed on 4 separate 
attempts due to abdominal pain, distension and diarrhea.  He was 
tried on several formulations without improvement. Patient 
educated on risks/benefits of TPN.  Ultimately, he was started 
on TPN via R PICC access. He will eventually need consideration 
for a Port-A-Cath if he is to continue TPN long term--given the 
uncertainty about how long he would require TPN, port not placed 
this admission.  He tolerated TPN well with no electrolyte 
abnormalities and signs of refeeding syndrome. He was giving 
thiamine intermittently throughout his hospitalization with 
tubefeed and TPN. 

# Dysphagia | Esophageal Spasm - The patient reported 
significant swallowing issues during his stay and refused to 
take in POs, including pills. He had a barium swallow study that 
showed findings consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm. GI 
consult team wanted to follow up with manometry testing as 
outpatient before starting therapy. Fortunately, his symptoms 
improved during the course of his stay, and he requested 
trialing PO food and was able to tolerate small amount of POs on 
discharge.

# Chronic Back Pain | Chronic Abdominal Pain - Due to NPO 
status, he was given IV hydromorphone in place of his PO regimen 
at home for the most part of his stay. The patient requested on 
multiple occasions to speak with the Pain specialists here. The 
Pain Consult team saw the patient and recommended uptitration of 
gabapentin to 900mg TID for chronic pain and maintaining his 
home narcotics regimen. The team discussed with the patient that 
his abdominal pain can possibly be attributed to his high 
narcotics requirement leading to narcotics bowel syndrome. The 
patient was very reluctant to the idea of decreasing his pain 
medications, stating that without them, he cannot have a normal 
life and wants to have a life. He was discharged on his home 
regimen, but with the understanding that if abdominal symptoms 
should recur or persist, he may need to consider downtitration 
of opiates. He reported needing more hydromorphone despite 
having filled a recent prescription for a 1 month supply only 2 
weeks prior to admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypertension: The patient's BPs had been well controlled 
throughout his admission up until the last part of his stay, 
when he had elevated BPs to 180s at times. His home labetalol 
regimen was uptitrated to 400mg TID from 300mg TID. It's 
possible this is due to switching from IV hydromorphone to PO.

# COPD: No symptoms while hospitalized. He continued home 
inhaler regimen. 

# Diabetes Mellitus: Complicated by neuropathy. Patient endorsed 
neuropathic pain in his feet. He continue home Gabapentin liquid 
as tolerated.

# Coronary Artery Disease: He had no symptoms. He continued ASA 
and labetalol. Lisinopril was DC'ed as outpatient due to labile 
blood pressures.
  
# Anxiety/Depression: The patient's overall mood was stable but 
he became tearful at times when discussing his chronic illness. 
He continue home lorazepam, buproprion, and buspirone.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- TPN: Will need ongoing evaluation of his nutritional 
requirement.
- Access: Patient currently has a PICC for TPN administration. 
If he will be on TPN for a long time, please consider placing a 
Port for longer term access.
- Antibiotics: Will need to continue taking rafaximin 550mg PO 
TID for 7 days, until ___.
- Pain: Patient has been having ongoing issues with abdominal 
pain. His gabapentin was uptitrated to 900mg TID per the 
recommendations of Pain consult team.
- Hypertension: Patient's BP was low earlier during stay but 
became elevated towards the end (160s), likely due to no longer 
receiving IV pain medication. His labetalol was uptitrated to 
400mg TID. Please consider another antihypertensive agent since 
his heart rate is only ___ at discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after having increasing difficulty 
with maintaining nutrition at home and increasing abdominal 
pain. We performed a CT scan that ruled out a small bowel 
obstruction. We performed a colonoscopy that showed inflammation 
at your anastamosis site, for which we are treating you with 
budesonide, an oral steroid. Furthermore, for your difficulty 
swallowing, we found some signs of esophageal dysmotility on a 
barium study. Fortunately, your symptoms improved without any 
intervention.

Despite our best attempts to start nutrition with tube feed, we 
were unsuccessful. Therefore, we eventually decided to start 
total parenteral nutrition, which you will need to continue on 
until you are able to better tolerate eating by mouth. Last, we 
tried to optimize your diarrhea by trialing you on an 
antibiotics to treat bacteria overgrowth in the small bowel.

Your blood pressure was elevated towards the end of your 
hospitalization. We increased your home dose of labetalol, and 
you will need to follow up with Dr. ___ further 
titration.

Please check your finger sticks at home so that we can monitor 
your glucose level and determine whether you need insulin in 
your TPN.

It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the best!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team
 
Followup Instructions:

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of weight loss. He has a history of Crohn's disease, multiple laparotomies, and short gut syndrome, which has led to complications such as intermittent small bowel obstruction and dependence on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He also has a history of chronic abdominal pain, depression, and anxiety. On admission, his physical examination revealed a diffusely tender abdomen with mild rebound tenderness, and his laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein. He was diagnosed with a possible small bowel obstruction and was treated with nebulizer therapy and oral steroids. At discharge, his vital signs were stable, and his physical examination revealed a mild firmness and diffusely tender abdomen. His laboratory results showed improvement in his white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, but his albumin and calcium levels remained low. He was prescribed medications for his chronic pain and was advised to follow up with his primary care physician.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service for 
evaluation and treatment.  On ___, the patient underwent left 
carotid endarterectomy, which went well without complication 
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the 
floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and oxycodone 
for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received oxycodone and tylenol with good 
effect and adequate pain control.  

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. An artertial 
line was initially placed for close blood pressure monitoring. 
He was continued on all home medications including beta-blocker. 
Home ace-inhibitor was restarted POD1.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Foley catheter 
was removed at midnight POD0 and the patient voided. Following 
foley catheter placement, hematuria was noted. It cleared over 
the postoperative course. Urology recommended the patient be 
seen by his outpatient urologist given his history of bladder 
cancer. This was commnunicated to the patient and his wife and 
daughter directly.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection.   

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required. INR was checked POD1 
after coumadin was held POD0. It was restarted on his home 
dosing regimen POD1. Communication with his PCP who manages his 
coumadin as an outpatient was made prior to discharge and 
followup INR check and coumadin dosing was established. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

IMAGES
===============
ANKLE ___

IMPRESSION: 
No signs for acute bony injury or bony destruction. If there is 
high clinical concern for septic joint, MRI imaging is 
recommended. There is swelling along the left ankle greater than 
that of the right side. 
.

KNEE ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large left-sided joint effusion. No acute fracture is seen. 
2. Tricompartmental osteophyte formation, chondrocalcinosis and 
multilateral compartment narrowing, the combination of findings 
can be seen in the setting of CPPD arthropathy. 
  

.
ECHO ___
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45% to 
50% ). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular 
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation 
is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There 
is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. 
Normal regional and global biventricular systolic function. The 
valves are well seen without significant regurgitation making 
endocarditis unlikely.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D 
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar. Overall ejection fraction is similar

___ 08:50AM BLOOD Cyclspr-___SSESSMENT/PLAN:
___ man with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p 
autologous SCT ___, secondary AML s/p allogous SCT in ___ 
(day +34) and CKD Stage III admitted with fever and coagulase 
negative staph isolated from blood cultures ___ which was 
determined to be a contaminant. He underwent knee aspiration and 
was found to have pseudogout.
.
# Bacteremia: Patient with low grade fevers at home and gram 
positive cocci isolated from ___ bottles drawn ___ from 
___'s catheter. He was treated with vancomycin IV on 
admission. ___'s catheter was pulled and culture of the tip 
was negative. He developed acute onset left knee pain on 
hospital day 2, the knee was warm and markedly swollen, left 
ankle swelling was also noted. Concern for septic arthritis was 
raised. Rehumatology was consulted who performed arthrocentisis 
which showed WBC 47K and calcium pyrophosphate crystals. 
According to rheumatology, calcium pyrophosphate chrystals can 
be seen in both pseudo gout and in septic arthritis. Given 
concurrent immunosupresant therapy, and rising peripheral 
leukocytosis in the setting of positive blood cultures, concern 
was raised for septic arthritis. Culture of the fluid was 
negative though he was on vancomycin at the time which may have 
sterilized the culture.  He was taken to the operating room with 
orthopedics and underwent washout of his left knee and ankle. 
Operative cultures showed no growth x 48 hours. Given 
involvement of multiple joints, concern for endocarditis was 
raised, TTE showed no valvular abnormalities or vegitations. ID 
was consulted, blood culture from ___ was speciated as coag 
negative staph. After discussion with ID, it was determined that 
the coag negative staph was a contaminant and vancomycin was 
discontinued. He remained afebrile x 48 hours off of 
antibiotics. Surveillance cultures were drawn and were negative, 
(there were two cultures which were pending at the time of 
discharge). He will need to keep the staples (knee) and sutures 
(left ankle) in place until two week follow up appointment with 
Dr. ___ in Ortho ___. He was given a limited 
prescription for oxycodone for pain on discharge.  
.
# Pseudogout: As above, patient developed swollen, red knee on 
hospital day 2, it was aspirated showing calcium pyrophosphate 
chrystals consistent with pseudogout. He developed bilateral 
ankle swelling and pain also related to pseudogout. After 
infeciton was ruled out, he was started on prednisone 20mg and 
will taper as below. He will need to follow up with rheumatology 
in ___ weeks.
___ start prednisone 15mg PO daily
___ start prednisone 10mg PO daily
___ start prednisone 5mg PO daily
___ discontinue prednisone
.
# Dysuria: patient complained of long standing dysuria, improved 
since starting Phenazopyridine prior to admission. UA was 
negative, urine culture negative. BK virus was negative. He was 
treated with phenazopyridine and his symptoms resolved.
.
# Thrush: patient complained of dysphagia and was found to have 
thrush. He was started on nystatin and will need to continue x 
14 days.

.
# Rash: Hyperpigmented patch overlying axillae ___ with central 
hypopigmentation was noted on exam. Per outpatient records, this 
had been present for weeks and improving. It did not appear to 
be cellulitis. Possibly contact dermatitis, according to the 
patient it was resolving after stopping antiperspirant.

.
# Left Shoulder pain: Patient with chronic pain affecting back 
and shoulders, it has previously been poorly controlled with 
fentanyl and lidocaine. On admission, he reported dramatic 
improvement in pain since starting cyclobenzaprine. Shoulder 
pain episodically flared throughout hospital stay however it was 
not warm, red or swollen and suspicion for septic arthritis 
involving the shoulder was low. Continued 
fentanyl/cyclobenzaprine/lidocaine patch. 
.
# Stage III chronic kidney disease: Creatinine has worsened over 
the weeks prior to admission weeks from 1.1 to a peak of 1.6. 
Bactrim and acyclovir had been held to reduce nephrotoxic 
burden. Creatinine trended up 1.4 to 1.6 after vancomycin at the 
time of discharge, it had trended down to 1.4.
.
# AML/MDS: Patient s/p allogous SCT ___, he was admitted on 
day +___. Cyclosporine levels were elevated and the dose was 
decreased to cyclosporine 100mg QAM, 125mg QPM. Fluconazole was 
changed to 200mg daily. Acyclovir and bactrim were on hold due 
to renal failure. He was treated with pentamidine inhaled x1 on 
___ for PCP ___.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for alcohol detoxification. We treated you 
with medicines to prevent dangerous withdrawal symptoms and side 
effects.

We also had out social worker and addiction specialists work 
with you to come up with a safe plan for discharge to keep you 
sober.  As you know, it is extremely important that you stop 
drinking to prevent the many terrible effects alcohol can have 
on the body.  As we discussed, this will be difficult, but with 
the proper social supports it is something that you have the 
capability to do.  By continuing to drink, you are only 
increasing the chances of death at a young age.
.
We also tested you for HIV and Hepatitis C, both of which were 
negative.  You had some findings in your mouth that may have 
been thrush (a mild infection), so you should finish 5 days of 
nystatin to treat this.  We have also started you on some 
vitamins, which you should continue to take.
.
Please note the following medication changes:
-Please START thiamine
-Please START multivitamin
-Please START folic acid
-Please START nystatin for 2 more days

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is a 46-year-old male who was admitted for alcohol withdrawal. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has experienced withdrawal seizures in the past. He drinks 16 drinks of vodka daily and had 6 drinks today, which led to symptoms such as insomnia, seeing flashes of ""demonic faces,"" and dreams of being levitated by devils. He was treated with benzodiazepines and had no further seizures in the hospital. His roommate, who was also an inpatient for detox, left the hospital against medical advice to be with him in the emergency department.

The patient's past medical history includes alcohol abuse with a history of withdrawal seizures, foot surgery, and hand surgery. His family history is significant for alcoholism, with his grandfather and many other family members affected.

The patient's physical examination was notable for poor dentition, thrush on his tongue, and a trace fine tremor. His laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, likely due to fatty deposition in the liver.

The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse and was advised to start outpatient treatment within one week of discharge. He was also prescribed medications including folic acid, multivitamins, thiamine, and nystatin oral suspension. ||endoftext||"

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female who comes to see 
Dr.
___ for second opinion. She developed illness in ___ 
___ where abnormal CXR led to CT chest which was followed since
every six months revealing in ___ stable bilateral
parenchymal nodules. A persistent soft tissue density in left
posterobasal segment bronchus was seen, along with left thyroid
stable hypodense nodules. This prompted further workup with
bronchoscopy on ___ revealing a left posterior basal segment
nodular endobronchial lesion. This was positive for carcinoid.
LLL BAL was negative. The pateint refused early bronchoscopy in
___ due to ""nerves"". Also noted on bronch was a posterior
tracheal wall invagination or submucosal nodule, and stenosis of
the right middle lobe. 
She underwent further evaluation with PET CT ___ which was
negative for uptake. MR neck was done on ___ to further
identify the subcarinal lesion in trachea, which was not 
biopsied
during bronch due to concern for bleeding. The MR revealed no
upper tracheal mass below the right vocal cords. There appeared
to be slight asymmetry and fullness in the region of the right
palatine tonsil to the right of the uvula and soft palate of
unknown significance. Visual inspection was recommended. An
enhancing left thyroid lesion corresponds to the hypodense 
nodule
on CT chest ___. No further diagnostic workup was done on her
thyroid.

The patient suffers from anxiety which she reports gives her
cough, palpitations and GI complaints. Once she is calm she 
feels
fine without fevers, chills, nightsweats, dyspnea or cough. She
does not want to hear the word ""cancer"" as she has anxiety over
such. She takes ativan and remembers trialing SSRI in past but
had diarrhea over such. She presents for elective resection of 
this mass.

IMAGING AND STUDIES

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is 
normal left ventricular wall thickness with anormal cavity size. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. However, 
the inferior wall ishypokinetic. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no resting 
leftventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade II 
diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricularcavity size with 
normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal.The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
Theaortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta 
diameter. There is no evidence for anaortic arch coarctation. 
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. There is 
SEVERE aortic valvestenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or less). There 
is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildlythickened. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspidvalve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimatedpulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

CAROTID US ___
Right ICA <40% stenosis. 
Left ICA <40% stenosis. 
Delayed upstroke in the bilateral ICAs, and more subtle delay in 
the CCA is most likely due to known known severe aortic 
stenosis. 
There is significant calcification artifact in the proximal 
right ICA thus the severity of stenosis may be underestimated, 
consider cross-sectional imaging if concerning symptoms are 
present. 

ANKLE 3 VIEWS ___
No acute fractures or dislocations are seen. There are mild 
degenerative 
changes of the anterior tibiotalar joint with spurring.  
Vascular 
calcifications are seen.There are calcaneal spurs.  There are 
mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of the talonavicular 
joint.  There is mild overall demineralization.

echocardiogram done ___, but recalls no plans to intervene. 
Telemetry during admission only pertinent for slightly prolonged 
PR interval and mild bradycardia. Carotid ultrasound revealed 
not clinically significant stenosis of both carotid arteries, 
less than 40% stenosis. Patient is to immediately report to 
___'s emergency room with the help of his 
daughters once landing in ___ as he is adamant about not 
wanting to undergo work up and intervention here in ___ due

TTE ___
Conclusion: The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. 
There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal 
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal. However, the inferior wall is hypokinetic. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. There is Grade 
II diastolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricular cavity size 
with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal 
for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. 
The aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending 
aorta diameter. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. 
There is SEVERE aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2 or 
less). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. 
Old inferior infarct.

# CAD: EKG showing prior inferior MI. Recent stent placed in
___. Currently without angina. Continue metoprolol, 
clopidogrel and statin. Imdur discontinued in light of softer 
pressures and EF of 60%

Defered trending further in absence of concern for ACS. Can 
consider a demand etiology in light of stenotic valve

# Anemia: likely from chronic renal disease. B12
studies and TSH within normal limits.

# ESRD on HD: on ___ dialysis. Dialysis received on ___ 
___. Calcium acetate binder with meals was continued.

Output:","||startoftext||The patient is an 81-year-old male who presented with a syncopal episode after a baseball game. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), and atrial fibrillation (Afib). He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were notable for a temperature of 97.2°F, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 151/48 mmHg. His physical examination revealed a bradycardic rhythm, normal rhythm, and a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium.

Laboratory results showed elevated levels of troponin (0.53 ng/mL) and creatinine (11.0 mg/dL), as well as mild anemia (Hgb 11.3 g/dL). Imaging studies revealed severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0 cm² or less, as well as mild degenerative changes in the ankle joints.

The patient was prescribed medications at discharge, including Eliquis for Afib and metoprolol tartrate for hypertension. He was also advised to undergo evaluation for surgical or transcatheter intervention for severe aortic stenosis, continue hemodialysis three times a week, and consider stopping metoprolol tartrate due to bradycardia.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was marked by a syncopal episode likely due to a vagal episode in the setting of severe aortic stenosis, and he was discharged with recommendations for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||"

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing robot-assisted 
laparoscopic left partial nephrectomy. No concerning 
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative 
note for details. The patient received perioperative antibiotic 
prophylaxis. The patient was transferred to the floor from the 
PACU in stable condition.  On POD0, pain was well controlled on 
PCA, hydrated for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with 
pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, 
the patient ambulated, restarted on home medications, basic 
metabolic panel and complete blood count were checked, pain 
control was transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was 
advanced to a clears/toast and crackers diet.  He did have some 
intermittent nausea but no vomiting on POD#1, which was well 
controlled with IV Zofran. On POD2, JP and urethral catheter
