History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a healthy ___ YOM with recent diagnosis of 
polycythemia ___ s/p phlebotomy Q2 weeks who was in his usual 
state of health watching TV at home when he developed acute 
chest pressure that radiated up to his throat on the day of 
admission. It affected the patient's breathing, making it 
difficult to take a deep breath, but was not associated with 
diaphoresis, numbness/tingling, pre-syncope, or palpitations. He 
tried to walk it off, but the pain persisted so he came to 
___. There he was found to have mild ST elevations in II, 
III, and avF and dynamic TWI in V3-V6 so code STEMI was called. 
He was given plavix 600 mg, ASA 162 mg, morphine 5 mg iv, zofran 
4 mg IV, ntg 0.4 mg x 2, 1 L NS, heparin bolus, and started on

IMAGING:

ECG on admission: Sinus bradycardia. Tiny inferior Q waves could 
represent recent or prior inferior myocardial infarction. Right 
ventricular conduction delay not meeting full criteria for right 
bundle-branch block. J point elevation in the lateral leads. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the findings are 
similar. 

Cardiac catheterization ___ preliminary: 
COMMENTS:      
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 

demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary 
artery 
disease.  The LMCA was a very short vessel with no 
angiographically 
apparent diseas.  The LAD and LCx were both large caliber 
vessels with 
no angiographically apparent disease.  The RCA had minimal 
luminal 
irregularities. 
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided 
filling 
pressures with an LVEDP of 27 mmHg.  There was no aortic 
stenosis noted 
on pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta. 
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a normal ejection fraction 
with no 
wall motion abnormalities.  There was no mitral regurgitation. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery 
disease. 
2. Normal ventricular function. 
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressure. 
4. No aortic stenosis. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
change.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male who presented to ___ for acute 
chest pain at rest, was transferred for code STEMI with mild ST 
elevations in inferior leads and T wave inversions in 
anterolateral leads, and was found to have positive cardiac 
biomarkers and mild luminal irregularities in the coronaries on 
catheterization.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Chest pain/elevated troponin: Unclear etiology of pain, but 
unlikely to be coronary artery disease given that patient denies 
angina symptoms, only cardiovascular risk factor is remote 
tobacco use, and there is no evidence of coronary artery disease 
on catheterization. It is possible that polycythemia ___ could 
have precipitated thrombosis in a distal branch not noted on 
catheterization.  Vasospasm is also a possibility, but there is 
no report of cocaine abuse.  Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy was 
considered unlikely given normal left ventriculogram, and 
unlikely to be myocarditis given patient does not have symptoms 
of congestive heart failure and URI symptoms only started 2 days 
ago with a normal echocardiogram.  Another possibility could be 
pulmonary embolus as patient did have hypoxia on presentation, 
however patient was not tachycardic, Wells score was 0 and 
D-dimer was normal.  Cardiac biomarkers were trended, showing 
elevations in troponin and CK-MB, which were trending down at 
the time of discharge.  Patient was started on aspirin 325 mg 
daily and metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.  Cardiac MR was 
ordered for outpatient workup to further delineate a cause of 
the patient symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.  He was chest 
pain free at the time of discharge.  Close follow-up was 
arranged with a cardiologist, as well as the patient's PCP.  
  
# Pump function: patient appeared euvolemic on exam, with no 
prior history of heart disease.  Echocardiogram revealed no 
abnormalities in heart function.  
.  
# Heart rhythm: Patient was in normal sinus rhythm with 8 beats 
of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight that was 
asymptomatic.  

# Polycythemia ___: patient is currently getting phlebotomy 
every 2 weeks.  He was arranged for outpatient hematology 
follow-up upon discharge.
  
TRANSITION OF CARE
------------------  
Code status: patient is confirmed full code  

Follow-up: patient will require a cardiac MR upon discharge, and 
is scheduled up for follow-up with cardiology.  His cholesterol 
panel returned after discharge and should be followed up by the 
outpatient cardiologist.   He will require follow-up with his 
outpatient hematologist for his polycythemia ___.  He also has 
scheduled follow-up with his PCP.

pMIBI ___
FINDINGS:  
  
Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged at 158ml end-diastolic 
volume (normal to 110ml).   
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a partially reversible 
inferolateral perfusion defect.  Gated images reveal 
hypokinesis, particularly in the inferior territory.  
  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 40%. 
  No prior study for comparison. 
  
IMPRESSION:  1) Partially reversible inferolateral perfusion 
defect.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M w/ ESRD s/p DCD renal transplant 
in ___ on cellcept/tacro, s/p MVC ___ yrs ago w/ chronic 
neurogenic bladder c/b recurrent UTIs, HTN, diabetes, and recent 
prolonged hospitalization for septic shock c/b ischemic colitis, 
presenting with abdominal pain. He underwent aggressive bowel 
regimen with large stool burden and had a colonoscopy concerning 
for ischemic colitis. He was seen by CRS with no recommended 
surgical intervention. Course was complicated by UTI with MDR 
e.coli, and he underwent pMIBI which did not identify any 
reversible perfusion defect per cardiology consultation team. He 
will follow up with CRS, cardiology, and transplant nephrology 
as an outpatient and is discharged to skilled nursing facility.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#. Abdominal Pain 
#. Hx of Ischemic/C.Diff Colitis
Patient with imaging initially significant for improving 
colitis, persistent proctocolitis, and large stool burden. 
Abdominal pain though to be most likely ___ to large stool 
burden, so was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen. CRS was 
consulted without acute surgical need. ID was consulted as he 
was scheduled to followup with them as outpatient, who d/c'd his 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl which he was on from his previous course. 
The patient was scheduled for outpatient flex sig, so GI was 
consulted to perform in house. His prep was successful and he 
underwent a full colonoscopy, which was significant for erosion, 
ulceration and strictures, concerning for ischemic colitis, 
along with ? of diverticuli or fistulas. He underwent a CT with 
rectal contrast with no signs of fistulas. He was again seen by 
CRS with no plan for surgical intervention. He was kept on 
standing bowel regimen. MMF dose was decreased due to initial 
concern for MMF colitis but due to low suspicion on colonoscopy 
findings for MMF toxicity this was increased to 500 bid from 
250.

#. ESRD s/p DCD Renal Transplant 
#. Neurogenic Bladder
Renal U/S fairly unremarkable. Creatinine peaked at 1.7 thought 
to be in the setting of pre-renal ___ from large volume diarrhea 
and improved with fluids. He was kept on MMF 250mg BID, tacro to 
1.5 BID,  Bactrim ppx, and home oxybutynin. His home lisinopril 
was held on discharge.

#. MDR E.coli CAUTI
>100,000 CFU of e.coli in UA noted when had leukocytosis. ID was 
consulted who recommended meropenem until ___. He will continue 
po vanc through ___ for c. diff prophylaxis. He was discharged 
on ___ 500 mg q6h. If necessary can switch to ertapenem 1g 
q24hrs per ID consult for dosing convenience.

#. H/o NSTEMI
During last hospitalization had suspicion for type II NSTEMI 
with ischemic bowel, with plan for outpatient cardiac cath. In 
the setting of potential surgical planning, cardiology was 
consulted, who recommended avoiding surgery unless urgently 
needed and to obtain pMIBI which was read as having partially 
reversible perfusion defect but cardiology consult team 
concluded there was no reversible defect. He was continued on 
ASA, rosuvastatin, metoprolol.

#. Acute on  Chronic Back Pain
Seen by chronic pain who recommended continuing home Vicodin 
7.5mg/325mg while in house.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
#. Afib
Currently appears in sinus rhythm. 
Continued Metoprolol for rate control while AC still held due to 
bleeding risk 

#. HTN
- Continued home amlodipine and held home lisinopril as above 

#. DMII
Continued home glargine 32 and standing Humalog 2 with meals

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

You were here because you were having abdominal pain. You were 
seen by the gastrointestinal (GI) team and the colorectal team, 
who felt that you had a lot of extra stool that was causing the 
pain. You also had a colonoscopy, which showed ulcers and narrow 
areas of your colon. Fortunately, the colorectal surgery team 
did not think you needed surgery. You had a stress test which 
did not show any active areas of decrease blood flow to your 
heart, and the cardiology team concluded that you would not 
benefit from an invasive procedure to look at the vessels of 
your heart. You were also found to have a urinary tract 
infection, for which you are discharged on a course of 
antibiotics through your PICC which will continue through ___. 
You will continue oral vancomycin through ___ to prevent c. diff 
infection.

When you leave, it is important you take your medications as 
prescribed. It is also important you keep your appointments as 
listed below. You will follow-up with cardiology and colorectal 
surgery as an outpatient as well as transplant nephrology.

We wish you the best of luck!

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended ensure supplementation, 
but pt. did not like ensure and made this clear to nutrition, 
ensure was seen unopened on pt.s tray every morning.
.
#Diarrhea: Likely ___ OI, differential is quite wide: crypto, 
giardia, ___, CMV, C. diff. All previous wkup 
was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Urinary retention - POD1 foley removed and patient unable to 
void, straight cath x 1, failed voiding trial again, foley 
replaced POD1 eve and removed again on POD3, voising trial 
pending.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the 
surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without 
erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.
 
She is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

The patient is a ___ year old gentleman with a history of AVR and 
aortic aneurysm repair, L CFA-axillary bypass graft ___ and R 
femoral to axillary bypass PFTE graft ___ admitted with right 
groin wound dehiscence and S. anginosus and MSSA bacteremia with 
course c/b rupture of a mycotic aneurysm at his femoral graft 
site. 

VASCULAR: Right groin wound was packed, and patient was started 
on vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl and admitted to the vascular 
surgery service. Admission blood cultures grew strep anginosus 
and wound swab was polymicrobial including MSSA and e Coli. CT 
angiogram was concerning for infection at the site of bypass 
graft anastamosis with the femoral artery. ID was consulted, who 
recommended transition to Zosyn. Pt was then pre-oped and 
consented for surgery for infected right femoral axillary 
bypass. Coumadin was stopped in preperation of surgery. He was 
on a heparin drip for his mechanical valve. 

CTA: 
  
1. Widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with 
minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the 
bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site. Although, 
no drainable 
fluid collections or abscesses are seen, this would be 
concerning for 
infection in the presence of clinical symptoms. 
  
2. Stable appearance of the ascending thoracic aortic graft and 
widely patent 
left axillary to femoral bypass graft. Normal appearance of the 
abdominal 
aorta and its major visceral branches. 
  
3. Unchanged appearance of an isodense right lower pole renal 
lesion and 
multiple indeterminate left renal lesions since the earlier 
study. These can 
be further evaluated by renal CTA protocol if this has not 
evaluated before. 

He was taken to the OR after developing several small bleeds 
from his operative site concerning for herald bleeds from a 
ruptured aneurysm. In the OR on ___ he was found to have fresh 
clotted blood at his femoral graft site with concern for a 
disrupted femoral anastomosis. He was found to have inflammatory 
changes in his retroperitoneum and a large inflammatory phlegmon 
at his rectus. The distal portion of his axillofemoral graft was 
detached and a saphenous vein graft was placed. 

___ - Exploration of right groin, control of the external iliac 
artery via a retroperitoneal exposure, excision of distal 
portion of the axillary-femoral bypass,
and vein patch repair of the femoral artery with saphenous vein 
patch.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

Due to his massive bleeding and transfusion requirements, he 
developed abdominal compartment syndrome overnight and was taken 
back to the OR on ___ for exploration of retroperitoneal space, 
washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, 
packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the 
abdominal incision which was left open. 

___ - Exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of 
retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the 
retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision 
which was left open.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

___ - Abdominal packing removal, Abdominal washout, Temporary 
abdominal closure.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR

___ - Abdominal closure with mesh.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR. 

On ___ patient had decreased urine output in setting of 
increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, 
which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and 
muscle paralysis. Neo was weaned. Sedation was transitioned to 
Precedex and vent was changed to PSV, with improvement in 
alertnent. 

Patient was noted to have elevated LFTs; RUQ ultrasound showed 
no abnormalities and LFTs trended downward. Systolic blood 
pressure rose to 200s with agitation, which responded to 
Fentanyl and hydralazine. 

On ___ patient was extubated. Patient passed bedside swallow 
eval and was transition to oral nutrition. 

On ___ patient was transferred from the CVICU to the VICU.

In the VICU to floor non incidental, The rest of the Hospital 
course will by systems:

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient narcotics IV with good 
effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, 
the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. 

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored. Pt also has Mechanical 
Valve was on IV heparin with transition tocoumadin on DC

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen 
to encourage bowel movement. Pt did have trouble with nutrion, 
started on dronabinol  2.5 mg PO BID. Pt also had loose stools - 
neg C Diff x 3, d/c'ed IV flagyl per ID

GU: Foley was removed when apprpriate. Intake and output were 
closely monitored. Pt did have acute on chronic renal failure. 
On ___ patient had decreased urine output in setting of 
increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, 
which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and 
muscle paralysis

ID: ID consult, Was originally on IV vanco . PO cipro / PO 
flagyl. ID transitioned to IV Zosyn - to be on a total of 6 
weeks, then PO supression therapy for life. Name of ___ 
to be determined. The patient's temperature was closely watched 
for signs of infection. 

He waa dmitted on ___ with a wound dehiscence and fever. ___ 
blood cultures drawn ___ grew S. anginosus as well as MSSA on 
___ and ___. A wound swab of the right groin site has grown 
MSSA as well as mixed flora. A CT Torso on ___ showed ""a widely 
patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with minimal soft 
tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal 
portion of the bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic 
site."" A TEE was performed showed ""a well-seated bi-leaflet 
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with normal leaflet motion 
and gradients. No discrete vegetations."" 

The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam for 
coverage of S. anginosus and MSSA BSI as well as a polymicrobial 
wound infection. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. 

On day of discharge, pt's BUN/creat =65/2.6, thought to be 
likely due to dehydration. IVF bolus was given with maintenance 
IVF to continue at rehab until creatinine trends down. PO fluids 
also encouraged. Lasix was discontinued and ___ should not be 
restarted until creatinine at baseline. VAC was also 
discontinued and  should continue on wet to dry BID until follow 
up. Foley was reinserted for urinary retention of approx 600 cc 
urine. Please attempt voiding trial in a day or so. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, 
voiding with foley, and pain was well controlled.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ male with history of renal transplant in ___ who 
presents with subacute kidney injury.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury - 
The patient was admitted with a Cr of 5.3. Renal U/S showed 
moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis, which had worsened over the 
past year. FeNa was 5.5%. Urine culture negative on two 
occasions. The patient had good urine output. A Cudet foley 
catheter was placed with good return. Both Urology and 
transplant nephrology were involved in the case. The etiology of 
the renal failure was thought to be multifactorial: ATN ___ 
recent illness with significant nausea/vomiting during which 
time he continued to take Lasix and losartan with obstructive 
component because the patient had stopped taking terazosin. The 
patient's Cr did not improve during ___ hospitalization. His K, 
which was intially 5.2 responded to Kayexelate and his potassium 
was stable throughout the admission. A repeat renal ultrasound 
showed progression of the hydronephrosis despite a foley 
catheter in place with good return. Cystogram showed a dilated 
collecting system but no ureteral stricture. The patient was 
discharged with a foley in place and urology follow-up the 
following week. He was also discharged to have his renal lytes 
rechecked and with close nephrology follow-up. Terazosin was 
restarted. Lasix and losartan were stopped with the patient to 
take lasix only every ___ day. 
.
# Hypertension- The patient had persistent hypertension during 
this admission. Losartan was held given acute kidney injury. The 
patient was continued on his home diltiazem and nadolol. 
Hydralazine 25 mg tid was started with good response. 
.
# S/p renal transplant- The patient's immunosuppressive regimen 
with prednisone 4 mg qday and imuran 50 mg qday was contiued as 
was calcitriol.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin. 
.
# GERD
- continude PPI
.
# BPH- Thought to have contributed to acute kidney injury. 
Terazosin 3 mg bid was started to be uptitrated as an 
outpatient. The patient was discharged with a foley in place and 
urology follow-up. 
.
# ___- patient has had over 4000 lesions removed. Outpatient 
follow-up with dermatology
.
# DVT prophylaxis with subQ heparin. The patient remained full 
code throughout this admission. Contact was with the patient's 
wife, ___ ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___ - 
___ was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for acute kidney failure. We 
placed a foley to help decompress your bladder and kidney 
collecting system. We performed 2 ultrasound studies of your 
kidneys, which both showed swelling and dilation of your kidney 
collecting system. We also performed a cystogram, that did not 
show any damage to the connection between your kidney and 
bladder. Your renal failure was likely caused by a combination 
of medications, dehydration from your recent illness, and 
possibly from an enlarged prostate. You will go home with a 
foley catheter from the hospital and will see a urologist next 
___ to have this foley removed. You will see Dr. ___

medication once your kidney function returns to normal. 
We STARTED terazosin 3 mg twice per day for your prostate.
We STARTED hydralazine 25 mg three times per day for high blood 
pressure (this will likely be stopped once you can restart 
Cozaar). 
We STOPPED ciprofloxacin.
. 
It is also very important that you have your renal function labs 
performed on this ___ to be sure there is no 
worsening of your kidney function and to be sure that your 
potassium is still within a normal range. These labs can be

Reports:

Chest x-ray ___
Moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity may 
represent atelectasis and/or consolidation. 

ECG: NSR, normal axis, no ST changes, nl QRS and PR intervals.

TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation 
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ F with history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis 
c/b diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension and 
encephalopathy currently on transplant list, IDDM, HTN and HLD 
who was directly admitted from home for acute renal failure.
  
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr < 1.5. Admitted with 
creatinine of 2.0, FeNa on admission 0.28% indicating pre-renal 
state. No evidence of infection on admission without fevers, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, suprapubic tenderness or dysuria, UA 
with epis and does not indicate UTI. Patient received albumin 
1g/kg (62.5grams) on HD 1 and morning after creatinine improved 
to 1.7. On HD 2 H/H was low so instead of albumin patient was 
volume challenged with 1 unit PRBCs and 25grams of albumin (1 
unit PRBCs=25 grams albumin). Diagnostic paracentesis ruled out 
SBP. Creatinine worsened after initial volume challenge and did 
not respond to second round of 1g/kg albumin. After failed 
improvement diagnosis of hepatorenal synrome was made and 
midodrine/octreotide were started and uptitrated without 
improvement in creatinine.  Cr steadily continued to rise, 
patient became oliguric and was volume overloaded.  The renal 
team was consulted.  Initially, plan was for pt to have HD line 
placed in ___ and start dialysis.  However, given active bleeding 
(see below), she was trasferred to SICU and started on CVVH.
       
# Cirrhosis: Chronic, related to schistosomiasis complicated by 
diuretic refractory ascites, chronic renal failure, portal 
hypertension, thrombocytopenia, prior SBP and encephalopathy. 
MELD 20 on admission with Childs Class C. Without evidence of 
encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation or asterixis on 
admission. Continued Rifaximin 550mg PO BID and Lactulose TID 
for HE prophylaxis. Continued Ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. 
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed and ruled out SBP. No GI 
endoscopy in our system but patient being evaluated for 
transplant, cannot be on transplant list without endoscopy so 
presumably completed somewhere. MELD rose to >30 in setting of 
hepatorenal syndrome and patient was listed for ABO incompatible 
liver. As HRS progressed, MELD score was at 40 on transfer to 
the SICU.

# Pulmonary edema: Pt w/ pulm edema on CXR on ___ and mildly 
symptomatic. Initially, pt subjectively some SOB, but O2 low to 
mid ___ on RA.  After 2 days, developed O2 requirement.  
Overload most likely in the setting of rapidly deteriorating 
renal function.  Less likely cirrhosis induced cardiomyopathy.  
Last TTE ___ with normal EF.  Repeat TTE with still normal EF 
but new moderate PA systolic HTN. Attempted to diurese with 
Lasix 20 iv then 80, put out very small amt of urine, 
incontinent.   In setting of rapidly progressive HRS, pt became 
oliguric and was unable to mobilize fluid.  Plan was made for 
dialysis as above.

# Hard palate bleed:  On ___ at ~6am, pt developed bleed right 
hard palate.  This was likely ___ mild oral trauma in the 
setting of coagulopathy--INR 3.6, platelets 75.  Initially, 
attempted to stop by applying pressure, unsuccessful.  Per 
discussion with ENT and OMFS, attempted to stop the bleed with 
afrin soaked gauze, topical thrombin, silver nitrate, 
aminocaproic acid.  Also transfused with platelets, FFP, and 
RBCs (as hct was 22 down from 25 at last check). Held continuous 
pressure for ~3 hours.  As soon as pressure was released, active 
bleeding was visualized.  Tamponaded bleed for ~10 minutes, but 
again continued to have uncontrollable bleed and was transferred 
to SICU on the transplant surgery service for elective 
intubation and packing.  The lesion was cauterized and the 
bleeding was controlled.  She was initially successfully 
extubated at transferred to the floor. 

# Hyponatremia: Hypervolumic hyponatremia from cirrhosis. Did 
not diurese patient given ___. Albumin and PRBCs given for 
intravascular volume and patient kept on 1.5L fluid restricted 
diet. She remained hyponatremic so fluid restricted further to 
1.2L with improvement in Na.
    
# Acute anemia: Patient with chronic anemia related to cirrhosis 
though with acute drop on HD 2. Unclear etiology without GIB 
during admission. Unknown if patient has varices without 
endoscopy in our system and is not on beta-blocker so presumably 
none on prior endoscopy. Possible hct drop was in setting of 
volume challenge overnight and dilutional effect though WBC and 
platelets unchanged. She was transfused 1 unit PRBCs both for 
anemia and volume challenge. Hct remained stable following 
transfusion.
     
# DM: Insulin Dependent, Type II. Hyperglycemic during admissin. 
Continued Glargine 12 units qHS and HISS
    
# HLD: Chronic, stable, continue zetia 
   
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Continue holding diuretics
- Recommend tracking down endoscopy report, unknown where 
completed

ICU Course ___ to ___, date of death)
Ms ___ was transferred to the surgical ICU the morning of 
___ after developing worsening melena. She had an EGD the day 
prior for the purpose of Dobhoff feeding tube placement, and 
during that EGD a duodenal polyp was noted and biopsied. Of 
note, she had an INR of 2.5 and fibrinogen of 59 prior to the 
procedure so snare removal of the polyp was deferred. The 
evening following the EGD, she had several episodes of melena 
thus prompting transfer to the ICU to facilitate repeat emergent 
EGD. The EGD ___ showed a lot of old blood around the polyp, but 
no active bleed from the stalk. 
The first few days in the SICU she remained HD stable, but 
continued to have melena with an unstable hematocrit. We 
transfused RBC, FFP, platelets and cryo to goal Hct of 30 and 
correct her coagulopathy. We were unable to completely correct 
her, and she began having significant oral bleeding. By ___, 
she was coughing blood, had an increased oxygen requirement. She 
remained encephalopathic and was not protecting her airway 
sufficiently so she was intubated. After intubation she had a 
pressor requirement which remained until time of death. She was 
started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/mica) and a CT 
torso showed severe pneumonia with very little residual aerated 
lung volume. 
On ___ she was begun on CVVH for acidosis and had increased 
pressor requirement with the addition of vasopressin. We 
continued to transfuse RBC/FFP/cryo to maintain blood levels.
On ___ she had increased pressor requirement and markedly 
increased oral bleeding. It was estimated she bleed 600cc 
periorally this day. Transfusions continued and she remained on 
high dose levo/vaso, though her pressor requirement was slightly 
less than the day prior. A family meeting was held. It was 
decided she would not want to be on full life support for more 
than 5 days. As it had been 3 days to this point, we decided to 
make a final decision ___ unless she acutely worsened.
On ___, the day of her death, she acutely worsened during the 
day. She became hypotensive despite increasing her pressor 
doses. Melena and oral bleeding increased and she grew 
increasingly tachycardic. She was not responding hemodynamically 
to significant product transfusion, and her ventilator settings 
were increased with more oxygen needed. Another family meeting 
was held and we discussed that she was decompensating rapidly 
and likely had an unsurvivable condition. The family present was 
receptive and understanding. She was transitioned to comfort 
care at 7pm, though the endotracheal tube was left in to prevent 
aspirating blood which we felt would cause her too much 
discomfort. She was started on a morphine drip. Her heart rate 
and blood pressure gradually declined and asystole occured at 
9:28pm. She was declared at 9:30pm. The family declined an 
autopsy.

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 69-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure. She has a history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and encephalopathy, and is currently on the transplant list. She was recently discharged from another hospital where she was admitted for abdominal distension, and was directly admitted to this hospital for acute renal failure. The patient's past medical history includes schistosomiasis complicated by cirrhosis and ascites, hypertension, IDDM, dyslipidemia, and nephrolithiasis.

The patient's allergies include aspirin. She has a history of bleeding, including a recent episode of hematochezia and melena, and has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome. She has also been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and has required oxygen therapy.

The patient's medications at discharge include midodrine and octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome, and rifaximin and lactulose for prophylaxis against hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient underwent several procedures during her hospital stay, including a diagnostic paracentesis, which ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and an EGD with feeding tube placement and duodenal polyp biopsy. She also underwent a TTE, which showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, including ALT, AST, and LDH, as well as elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Her creatinine level was elevated at 2.0 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was elevated at 28 mg/dL. Her albumin level was low at 3.7 g/dL, and her calcium level was elevated at 9.8 mg/dL.

Overall, the patient's hospital course was complicated by her underlying liver disease and acute renal failure, and she required multiple interventions to manage her symptoms and stabilize her condition. ||endoftext||"

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed male with a history of
focal epilepsy (probable temporal) who recently established care
with Dr. ___ in ___ who presents with increased seizure
frequency. 

History obtained from patient and medical record. He first saw
Dr. ___ in ___ with complaints of amnesia. At that time
he reported discrete ___ minute episodes of confusion (not
remember what day it was, repeating himself) which would resolve
and he would go back to feeling completely normal. He never had
any warning regarding this episodes. These were occurring about 
2
times per month. Provocation was stress and decreased sleep.
Please see Dr. ___ note from ___ regarding
the details.   

Dr. ___ his history was consistent with epilepsy (focal,
probably temporal) and he was started on Keppra 500 mg BID at
that time (___). He also had a 48 hour ambulatory EGG which
showed ""bitemporal independent and  occasional bitemporal
synchronous slowing along with relatively infrequent 
bursts of more generalized but centrally predominant theta
activity. These  findings are relatively nonspecific and may
represent underlying multifocal  subcortical pathological
abnormalities, vascular disease or sequela of 
traumatic head injury. No seizure activity was acquired during
the recording sessions. No interictal epileptic activity was
noted.""

Since he saw Dr. ___ in ___, he reports full compliance with
his Keppra. He has not been sick recently and has had no 
interval
head trauma. He has trouble remembering the details of what
brought him to the hospital today but thinks it was because of
""brain farts"" which are his seizures. Unfortunately his family
cannot be reached as he cannot remember their numbers (but he
says he would not usually remember them). Mr. ___ thinks he
did not have any seizures up until his recent episode which
brought him to the hospital. He reports that he cannot remember
what happened but he thinks he had a seizure at church
(___). He does not remember the interval history but
reports that he feels back to his normal self. 

Review of limited ___ records indicate that his family
brought him to the hospital on ___ with concern for increased
seizure frequency. He reportedly was having staring episodes and
repeating himself for ___ days leading up to presentations. The
episodes were more frequently and lasting longer so they finally
took him to the hospital. At ___, he was having episodes of
staring into space and repeating himself. This was of unclear
duration. He was given Ativan 2 mg IV x1 and Keppra 1 g x1. WBC

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Epilepsy service on ___ in the 
setting of increased seizure frequency. He was placed on 
continuous video EEG. He was initially kept on his home Keppra 
but this was then held from ___ in an effort to capture 
seizures. Mr. ___ did not have any clinical or 
electrographic seizures and there were no epileptiform spikes on 
his EEG. In coordination with the family, his medication was 
restarted 24 hours prior to discharge. Therefore his diagnosis 
remains epilepsy that is likely temporal lobe epilepsy based on 
semiology and family history however the EEG is non-diagnostic. 
As part of his evaluation for new onset epilepsy, an LP was 
performed on ___ which had 0 WBC, 1 RBC. An autoimmune 
encephalitis panel was sent out and is pending at the time of 
discharge. HSV PCR was negative. Otherwise, Mr. ___ remained 
on his home diabetes regimen with stable blood sugar

1. CXR (___)
Lungs are well expanded, with linear opacities at the lung 
bases, most likely representing atelectasis. However, 
curvilinear opacity could also represent scarring. Heart is 
normal in size, 
and there is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement. Soft tissue 
and bony structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSIONS: Atelectasis 
versus scarring at the left lung base. No acute 
abnormalities. 
2. CT Head w/o Contrast (___)
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, mass 
effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major 
vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are normal 
in caliber and configuration. Visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are well aerated. Osseous structures are 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Loss of Consciousness:
Most likely this was due to hypovolemia given pt's history of 
diarrhea, decreased PO intake and orthostatic symptoms. BP was 
also low on admission. Other concern on admission was for 
cardiogenic syncope.  EKG showed ST-T wave changes with T wave 
inversions in V1-V4 which were unchanged from prior ECGs.  
Troponins and CK were cycled and showed a Troponin of 0.08 which 
did not rise and was likely due to her kidney disease.  Pt had 
no signs of congestive heart failure and an echo was done which 
was normal.  She had no clinical signs of PE.  Has a history of 
seizures and migraines; however no seizure activity was 
observed. TIA/CVA is also unlikely with normal neuro exam. Pt 
also had a history of hypothyroidism and TSH was check and was 
>100.  Free T4 was low at 0.28. Pt has been non-compliant with 
meds in the past but stated that she had not missed any of her 
thyroid medication.  Pt's home pharmacy was called and stated 
that the prescription had last been filled in early ___ but 
had not been filled prior to this.  TSH was checked in the past 
___ and ___ and was elevated at this time as well.  Pt also 
had symptoms of hypothyroidism with weight gain, weakness, 
fatigue, headache and dry skin. Pt was also reported to be 
hypoglycemic on presentation and this could have been a 
contributing factor to syncope with poor oral intake. 
.
On admission, pt was due for dialysis and did undergo HD with 
2.3L removed. On arrival to the floor, BP was low at 80/40.  Pt 
required 2.5L of fluid resuscitation to bring BP to 100s.  She 
was asymptomatic during this time without chest pain, 
lightheadedness or dizziness.  Blood and urine cultures were 
sent and negative.  A urine tox was negative.  Orthostatic BPs 
were checked after fluid resuscitation and were normal.  An 
echocardiogram was done which was normal with an EF of 55%.  Pt 
did well clinically during admission and experienced no other 
symptoms of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.  Her 
anti-hypertensive medications were held in light of her low 
blood pressure.  She was given Levothyroxine at 100mcg/day given 
her low levels of T4 (was previously supposed to be taking 
75mcg/day).
.
The patient experienced no further symptoms of syncope during 
admission.  Telemetry showed no arrhythmias and echocardiogram 
was normal.
.
2. Hypoglycemia:
Pt was hypoglycemic on admission with blood sugar reported to be 
45 at ___. Fingersticks were checked throughout admission and 
blood sugars with in the low-normal range of ___.  LFTs 
were checked for possible causes for hypoglycemia and were with 
AST 45 and ALT 27.
.  
3. Diarrhea: 
Pt stated that diarrhea symptoms had been present prior to 
admission and continued through hospital stay.  Stool cultures 
and ova and parasites were negative.  Likely cause was viral 
gastroenteritis vs. narcotic withdrawal.
. 
4. Substance Abuse: 
Pt was on 120mg methadone daily per ___ clinic.  On date 
of admission, she did not receive this and began to experience 
withdrawal symptoms of anxiety and agitation.  She was given 
120mg of Methadone daily for her hx of narcotic abuse and 
withdrawal symptom prevention. She was given Trazadone 50 qhs as 
per home dose.
. 
5. ESRD:
Nephrology was consulted and pt was dialyzed on date of 
admission as well as on ___ as per home schedule (___). She 
was continued on Calcitriol and calcium carbonate. She tolerated 
dialysis well.
.  
6. Hx of Seizure:
Pt experienced no seizures while admitted. She was continued on 
her home done of Keppra.  
. 
7. Depression
Pt was continued on Fluoxetine.
