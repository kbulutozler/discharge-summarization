Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is an ___ lady, speaking only ___, with 
___ gastric cancer (diagnosed ___, currently on ramucirumab 
alone (held following surgery) and arthritis, who presented with 
a hip fracture after a fall from standing height.  

===ACUTE ISSUES=== 
#Hip fracture:  
#s/p Fall:  
Presented after a fall from standing height and found to have a 
right intertrochanteric hip fracture with varus angulation. CT 
head with subgaleal hematoma but no intracranial hemorrhage, and 
CT C spine negative for traumatic injury. Fall appears to be 
purely mechanical secondary to underlying neuropathy and 
progressive weakness with possible acute decompensation in the 
setting of pneumonia. She had no LOC, but may have an 
orthostatic component as well contributing to lightheadedness 
given poor PO intake. Troponins obtained for pre-op workup were 
slightly elevated x3 (max 0.03). Likely ___ slight ___, EKGs w/o 
e/o MI. 

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service with 
a right hip fracture. The patient was taken to the operating 
room on ___ for right hip ORIF, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given ___ antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient worked with ___ who 
determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
weight-bearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity, and 
will be discharged on ___ for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough discussion was 
had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or 
return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The 
patient was also given written instructions concerning 
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care. 
The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

 
#LLL pneumonia: CXR obtained on pre-op workup showed LLL 
opacity. Unclear if she had a true clinical pneumonia given she 
so did not have symptoms of pneumonia, but fall could be due to 
weakness in the setting of infection. Did not meet criteria for 
HAP. Treated with five day course of ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin. 
 
===CHRONIC ISSUES===
#Gastric cancer: 
Diagnosed ___. Treated with 5 cycles on folfox, followed by 
taxol/ramucirumab for 5 cycles (C5 D1 and ___. Seen by 
oncologist Dr. ___ on ___ who recommended stopping 
taxol and proceeding with ramucirumab alone due to concerns that 
the taxol was causing worsening neuropathy and interfering with 
her quality of life. Of note, ramucirumab was held following her 
operation. Will need outpatient evaluation and discussion of 
goals of care to determine further treatment course. In 
addition, patient had therapeutic paracentesis while inpatient 
on ___.

#GERD: Continued home omeprazole BID.  
#Hypertension: Held spironolactone given elevated creatinine at 
___ initially, restarted on ___.
#Depression: Held home citalopram for prolonged QTc. Lower dose 
may be safer for age.  
#Overactive bladder: Held home fesoterodine as was 
non-formulary.

SUMMARY STATEMENT
====================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with PMHx High grade lymphoma 
with burkitt's features s/p cycle 6 R-EPOCH, HTN, HLD, DM, and 
gout who presents with abdominal bloating and weight loss at 
home, found to have refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
confirmed on gastric biopsy, initiated on RICE therapy. His 
course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, ___, and one 
episode of hematuria. Problems addressed during his 
hospitalization are as follows:

#Recurrent Burkitts-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
Patient with high grade lymphoma with Burkitt like features 
refractory to 6 cycles of EPOCH-R therapy last given ___. 
Previously had IGH/MYC rearrangement and no evidence of BCL2 or 
BCL6 rearrangements. Initially presented with weight loss and 
abdominal bloating, CT AP demonstrating gastric thickening s/p 
EGD with biopsy demonstrating high grade B-cell lymphoma (CD20, 
CD10 positive; CD5 negative; ___ ISH negative; Ki-67 
proliferation index near 100%). Subsequent FISH and cytogenetics 
demonstrating pending. Initiated ICE therapy Cycle 1 
___ with rituximab administration ___. 
Received filgrastim ___. Initiated acyclovir for 
prophylaxis. Developed ___ likely in setting of Ifosfamide 
administration (see ___ below), otherwise tolerated with no 
issues. 

#Febrile neutropenia:
Tmax ___, otherwise remained afebrile, no source of 
infection identified. No localizing symptoms other than nasal 
erythema suspicious for HSV which he has had in the past, 
however on acyclovir, improved. CXR clear, elevation in alk phos 
(most likely medication effect), PICC line without suspicion for 
infection, no evidence of cellulitis, fungal markers negative, 
blood and urine cultures negative. Completed 7 day course of IV 
cefepime, discontinued when ___>500 over 3 days.

___:
Cr elevated over several days (Cr peak 2.1; baseline 1.1-1.2). 
Etiology most likely ATN supported by urine with fragmented 
granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells. Likely 
developed kidney injury from large volume autodiuresis (up to 
-3.5L over 24H) and medication effect causing tubular injury 
(Ifosfamide). Cr normalized with IVF to keep net fluid balance 
even. Given sodium bicarbonate for acidosis. Of note, in ___ 
developed tumor lysis syndrome at outside hospital (Cr peak 8.4, 
UA 515), renal biopsy with ATN/AIN requiring temporary dialysis. 


#Hematuria with blood clots:
Reported blood clot in urine x1, otherwise asymptomatic. UA 
unremarkable with no evidence of hematuria x2. Resolved 
spontaneously with no intervention. Possibly from ifosfamide 
administration, of note also has bladder mass on CT performed at 
___.

#Guaiac positive stool:
Intermittent melena on admission, resolved with initiation of 
PPI. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#Anemia:
Hg ___, likely due to lymphoma and bone marrow suppression from 
chemotherapy. Transfused PRN for Hg <7.

#HTN:
In setting of ATN and large volume autidiuresis, reduced home 
labetalol(decreased from 300 to 200 BID) and home amlodipine 
(decreased from 10 to 5 QD). Remained normotensive with this 
dose reduction.

#Gout: 
Continued home allopurinol

#DM:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___. You came to the hospital because you were losing 
weight at home and had bloating in your stomach. You initially 
went to ___, where a CT showed that there was 
progression of your cancer. You were then transferred to ___ 
for further treatment. Here, you were given ""RICE"" chemotherapy. 
You developed kidney injury from this chemotherapy that got 
better over time with fluids. You also developed fevers which 
got better with IV antibiotics. You briefly had some blood in 
your urine which resolved by the time you were discharged, this 
is also most likely from your chemotherapy.

Please continue to take your medications as prescribed and to 
follow-up with your doctors as ___.

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ care team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal bloating and weight loss. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, and was previously diagnosed with high-grade B cell lymphoma and underwent 6 cycles of chemotherapy (EPOCH-R). He presents with diffuse gastric wall thickening around the gastroesophageal junction and an 11 mm bladder wall lesion, which is concerning for refractory high-grade lymphoma. He was transferred to the hospital for initiation of chemotherapy.

The patient's past medical history includes treatment with Cytoxan, Nitrogen Mustard, Rituximab, and other medications. He has a family history of CAD and CVA/HTN.

Upon admission, the patient's physical exam was normal, with no acute distress or abnormalities noted. His labs showed anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. He underwent imaging studies, including a TTE and CT neck without contrast, which showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and global systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation, and no lymphadenopathy.

At discharge, the patient's physical exam was again normal, with no acute distress or abnormalities noted. His labs showed improvement in his anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. He was prescribed medications, including mirilax and Colace, and was advised to follow up with his primary care physician.

The patient has allergies to Bactrim and has a history of anemia, gout, and hypertension. He is currently taking medications for his hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. ||endoftext||"

History of Present Illness:
History is obtained from the medical record and from the patient 
with her son serving as interpreter. Please see also OMR notes 
by Dr. ___ ___ ___ for 
additional information. Briefly, Ms. ___ is a ___ year old 
___ woman who has multiple medical problems including 
diet-controlled type II diabetes, hypertension, chronic joint 
pain (osteoarthritis and seronegative RA vs. PMR), and recent 
visual problems with ocular discomfort. She has had recent 
complaints of chest pain and progressive dyspnea on exertion (to 
the point where she has had to crawl up stairs and sit down 
while shopping) for which she has been evaluated by Dr. 
___. 
.
In terms of her chest pain and DOE, she describes both as 
occurring together. The chest pain is present constantly, 
ranging from severity of ___ to ___ and is worse with 
movement, pressure to the chest wall, deep breathing, or 
exertion. The shortness of breath is only with activity and does 
not occur at rest. She describes the chest pain as pressure-like 
in quality and occuring in the center chest to beneath the left 
breast. She has had these symptoms for several months but feels 
that they have been getting worse recently. She has had a cough 
for about the last two months which is occasionally productive 
of ___ sputum; she initially thought that this was due to a 
cold and had some associated runny nose, though now feels cough 
is not due to URI as it has persisted.
.
She underwent echocardiogram in ___ which showed mild LVH 
with preserved ejection fraction (> 55%) and was otherwise 
unrevealing in terms of etiology for her dyspnea. In addition, 
she has had periodic complaints of heart palpitations for which 
she was been monitored by ___ of Hearts; 7 symptomatic episodes 
revealed sinus rhythm at rate ___ with occasional APBs and 
atrial bigeminy.  She did undergo stress test back in ___ by 
___ which was negative for ischemia, but has had no 
further stress testing since that time. Currently, she is 
awaiting ophthalmologic procedure for her eye discomfort, and 
her ophthalmologist at ___ Eye & ___ has recommended complete 
cardiac work up prior to this procedure (details unclear as 
notes are out of our system; however, per Dr. ___ 
note from ___ it is ""non urgent""). In addition, per Dr. 
___ from ___, cardiac catheterization is 
indicated to evaluate for left main disease prior to surgery 
requiring monitored anesthesia care, as well as to further 
evaluate for coronary artery disease given her multiple risk 
factors for atherosclerosis.  She had cardiac catheterization 
planned recently, although this procedure was cancelled given 
her aspirin allergy and the possible need for intervention. The 
patient was given the option of waiting for allergy appointment 
to further evaluate this allergy or for CCU admission for rapid 
desensitization, and chose the latter.
.  
On review of systems, she denies any recent fever, chills, 
nightsweats or rigors. She denies prior history of stroke, TIA, 
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time 
of surgery. No PND or clear orthopnea (must sleep on her side 
secondary to back/spine pain). She does have swelling of the 
ankles which has been stable, as well as swelling in the knees 
from her arthritis (L > R). She has had palpitations for which 
___ has worn ___ monitor as above. She has multiple myalgias and 
joint pains for which she is followed in ___ clinic; 
these are stable. Cough as per HPI with no hemoptysis. No 
N/V/D/C, no abdominal pain, no changes in bowel habits (last BM 
this morning, normal), no black stools or red stools. She has 
had several episodes of LH over the past several days, most 
recently two days ago when she felt lightheaded after getting 
out of a car and had to sit and hold her head. No syncope. No 
dysuria or hematuria. All of the other review of systems were 
negative.

CXR (___):
In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung 
volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse 
diameter of the heart. There is fullness of indistinct pulmonary 
vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, 
beyond that which would be expected with poor inspiration on a

Cardiac Cath (___): 
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed 
no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LMCA 
was free 
from angiographic disease.  The LAD had mild plaquing. The 
ostial 
diagonal branch demonstrated 60% focal stenosis.  The LCx was a 
small 
vessel giving rise to a large OM1 (functionally a ramus 
intermedis) and 
four other tiny OMs.  The RCA was a large dominant vessel with 
mild 
plaquing. 
  
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 
___ F with multiple medical problems and recent complaints of 
worsening dyspnea on exertion who presents for planned CCU 
admission for aspirin desensitization prior to cardiac 
catheterization for further work up of DOE.  
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# Diastolic CHF: Pt has diastolic CHF based on cardiac cath, and 
given the absence of coronary disease, this is likely the cause 
of her exertional dyspnea. This is consistent with her 
longstanding history of HTN. She was diuresed with IV lasix and 
her home lasix was increased to 20mg po daily. She was also 
started on metoprolol succinate 50 mg qday and lisinopril 2.5mg 
po qday. At the time of discharge she was asymptomatic and her 
weight was 64.5kg.  
.
# Pulmonary HTN: Pt has significant pulmonary HTN (PA pressure 
52/___) based on cardiac cath, and this is likely also 
contributing to exertional dyspnea. This is likely ___ her left 
sided diastolic CHF, but given history of bronchiectasis, cannot 
rule out a primary pulmonary component to her elevated PA 
pressures. She was discarged on ACEI, diuretic and beta blocker 
per above. 
.
# ASA Allergy: Pt underwent successful ASA desensitization. ASA 
reaction is documented as urticaria/angioedema, but during 
desensitization she only experienced pruritis without other 
manifestations of hypersensitivity. She was desensitized per 
___ protocol without indicent and should continue taking ASA 
81 indefinately to prevent recurrence of hypersensitivity.  
.
# HTN: Her metoprolol tartrate 25mg qday was changed to 
metoprolol succinate 50mg qday. Her lasix was increaed to 10mg 
qday and she was started on lisinopril 2.5mg qday. Her BP was 
well controlled on this regemin while hospitalzied, but her 
medications should be further titrated by her PCP as an 
outpatient.
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.
# DIABETES: Last HbA1c in ___ was 5.7%. Currently off all 
medication. She was covered with ISS while in house her BG was 
well controlled
.  
# ANEMIA: Her home folic acid and B12 were continued. Her Hct 
remained stable in the low/normal range throughout her hospital 
course and no intervention was undertaken.
.  
# JOINT PAIN: Multifactorial (has RA vs. PMR and osteoarthritis 
by history, also status post bilateral total knee arthroplasty). 
She was continued on her home Voltaren 1% gel, sulfasalazine and 
Ca/Vit D and her pain was well controlled on tylenol prn. Pt is 
followed by rheum, who will see her as an outpatient. 
.  
# VASOACTIVE SYMPTOMS S/P MENOPAUSE: She was continued on her 
home Premarin 0.9 mg PO daily; should follow up with PCP 
regarding weaning estrogen. 
.  
# PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES: She was contined on her home mirtazapine 
and venlafaxine. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: She was discahrged home with Cardiology, 
PCP, ___ and Allergy/Immunology follow up. Dietary teaching 
was performed regarding the importance of low Na diet and 
warning signs about fluid overload.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a cardiac catheterization to test for 
heart problems that were causing your breathing trouble and 
chest pain. You did not have any significant blockages in your 
heart arteries but we did find that you had too much fluid in 
your body that wa affecting your breathing and making you tired. 
We gave you some intravenous furosemide to get rid of the fluid 
and will have you take 20 mg of furosemide daily instead of 10 
mg to keep the fluid from coming back. If your breathing worsens 
again, this means that the fluid is coming back. Weigh yourself 
every morning, call Dr. ___ weight goes up more than 3 
lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. It is very important that 
you avoid salt in your cooking and check the ingredients for 
high salt content. You can have about 2000mg of salt daily. 
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. Increase furosemide to 20 mg daily
2. Stop taking metoprolol tartrate, take metoprolol succinate 
instead once a day
3. Start aspirin 81 mg daily, do not stop taking this medicine 
unless Dr. ___ you to. 
4. Start lisinopril 2.5 mg daily to lower your blood pressure.

Discharge Instructions:
It has been a privilege to take care of you ___ 
___.
.
You were hospitalized because your heart was beating very slowly 
because of an abnormality in the electrical wiring system of 
your heart; you have a condition known as complete heart block.
.
You underwent an emergency procedure to implant a pacemaker into 
your chest that provides your heart with a regular electrical 
current to ensure that it beats at the correct rhythm. You 
tolerated the procedure well and the pacemaker is functioning 
correctly. This pacemaker will hopefully help to prevent 
recurrence of the fatigue that you have been experiencing.
.
You should avoid raising your arms above your head, and should 
also avoid heavy lifting, for the next several weeks.  Do not 
remove the steri-strips over the site where the pacemaker was 
placed.

Implantation of a pacemaker is surgical procedure, which is why 
you will require antibiotics to prevent infections. The 
following is your antibiotic regimen:
# START: Clindamycin 300 mg every 6h for 1 day
.
Otherwise, your heart regimen is unchanged. Your current heart 
regimen is the following:
# CONTINUE: Torsemide 60 mg twice daily
# CONTINUE: Lisinopril 10 mg daily
# CONTINUE: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual tablet as needed for 
CP
**Take up to 3 tablets 5 minutes apart then call ___ if pain 
does not resolve.**
# CONTINUE: Cholestyramine 4 gram packet daily
# CONTINUE: Ezetimibe 10 mg daily
.
We decreased the dose of your Gabapentin to 300mg daily. This 
dose is based on your kidney function levels.  You can discuss 
the dosing with your primary care doctor next week.

Please continue to take all of your other medications as 
previously prescribed. 
.
Please attend the follow-up appointments detailed below.
 
Followup Instructions:

Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness and incoordination
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endobronchial biopsy of right and left lung nodules

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with a history of
prostate CA s/p radiation, hyperlipidemia, cervical spine
disease, and longstanding tobacco use who presents with left
sided weakness and incoordination over the last 10 days. He
reports that he had ""the flu"" about 6 weeks ago with URI 
symptoms
and muscle aches. This resolved, but then about 2 weeks ago he
began to have muscle aches again that felt very similar. These
started in his left quadriceps and then spread over the next
several days to involve his bilateral quadriceps, calves, and
triceps as well. He saw his PCP ___ ___ for his annual physical
and then again on ___ due to the persistent myalgias. At that
point he had also begun to experience intermittent vertigo as
well. This was only present with movement such as turning his
head or standing up to walk and resolved completely at rest. He
describes it as a brief sensation of spinning or movement 
lasting
seconds. CK and ESR were checked due to the myalgias and were
negative. His vertigo was felt to be most likely peripheral.
Basic labs were all normal and he was advised to monitor his
symptoms. 

However over the next week his vertigo persisted, still only
brought on by movement, and he also began to notice weakness in
his left arm and leg. He initially attributed this to the muscle
aches, which ultimately resolved on the right but have still
persisted a little in his left quad and triceps. However over 
the
last week he has also noticed that it is more difficult to
control his left arm and leg. He says they feel weak but also
clumsy, and his arm ""flops around"" when he tries to use it. His
wife says he also veers toward the left when he walks, and his
left leg has ""given out"" on him a couple of times. He has fallen
twice in the last week, once when getting out of the car and 
then
again yesterday when he was trying to help his wife make up the
bed. Both times his left leg just seemed to buckle and he fell 
to
the ground, sustaining some scrapes but no significant injuries.
Last night he was playing cards with his friends, which he has
done for ___ years, and realized that he couldn't hold the cards
or shuffle with his left hand. At this point he became 
concerned,
as he says one of his other friends in the group had a stroke a
few years ago with very similar symptoms. He therefore went back
to Dr. ___ this morning, and on exam he was found to
have left sided weakness and ataxia and was sent to the ED for
further evaluation.

In addition he also reports one episode of headache last week on
___, around the time that he first noticed the left sided
weakness. He describes the headache as bifrontal pressure with 
no
other associated symptoms. This was a bit unusual for him as he
does not typically get headaches but it resolved on its own and
has not recurred. He also noticed brief blurring of vision in 
his
left eye around the same time which also lasted for about a day
and then resolved. He denies any diplopia or loss of vision. He
reports that he has chronic tingling in his left arm and hand 
due
to an ulnar nerve injury many years ago, but this has seemed a
bit more prominent lately than usual. He denies any numbness or
tingling in his face or leg. He denies any problems with his
speech.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, diplopia, 
dysarthria,
dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech. No bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention. 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills (since his flu-like illness 6 weeks ago).  No night 
sweats
or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of 
breath.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

PATHOLOGY: 
- Lung biopsies (___): ***PATHOLOGY PENDING***

STUDIES: 

- NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT (___): Findings concerning for multiple 
intracranial lesions which raises suspicion for metastatic 
disease.  Correlate with history of malignancy. MRI would be 
helpful for further evaluation. 

- CTA HEAD/NECK (___):  
1. Three distinct heterogeneously-enhancing parenchymal lesions, 
with cystic necrosis, within the superior cerebellar vermis, and 
the left frontal and parietal lobe, worrisome for metastatic 
disease. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
2. Mild effacement of the left ambient cistern. 
3. 2.7 cm soft tissue mass within the azygos lobe with an 
associated 3.2 cm necrotic precarinal lymph node which may 
represent primary bronchogenic neoplasm with metastatic 
lymphadenopathy. 
4. Patent vasculature. No aneurysm, dissection, or stenosis. 

- MRI BRAIN W/WO GAD (___): 
1. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior frontal and left 
medial 
occipital regions, which may be leptomeningeal or superficial 
cortical, 
without significant mass effect. Punctate left superior frontal 
cortical 
metastasis adjacent to the larger left frontal metastasis. 
2. Hemorrhagic metastases in the left superior cerebellar vermis 
and left 
cerebellar hemisphere. The dominant metastasis in the left 
cerebellar vermis effaces the left ambient cistern with 
deformation of the left inferior colliculus. It also partially 
effaces the fourth ventricle without obstructive hydrocephalus. 
3. 4 mm enhancing lesion in the superior right aspect of the 
occipital bone, corresponding to a lytic lesion with erosion of 
the outer table on the prior CT, indicating an osseous 
metastasis. 
  
COMMENT: The appearance of the intracranial and calvarial 
lesions is more suggestive of metastatic disease from the right 
apical pulmonary mass seen on the preceding CTA, than from 
prostate cancer, but tissue diagnosis is needed. 

CT ___ W CONTRAST (___):  
1. Multiple enlarged low-attenuation mediastinal lymph nodes and 
right hilar lymph node. A 1.4 cm subpleural nodule in the right 
upper lobe. Adjacent to/contiguous with the necrotic right upper 
paratracheal lymph node. Multiple pulmonary nodules identified 
measuring up to 5 mm. Findings are suspicious of pulmonary and 
nodal metastases. The mediastinal lymph nodes are amenable for 
biopsy via bronchoscopy. 
2. A 1.5 cm and 1.6 cm hypodense lesions in segment 2 and 4B 
nonspecific but suspicious for hepatic metastasis, especially 
segment 4B lesion. 
3. 3.5 cm solid lesion identified posterior to the left psoas 
muscle, 
suspicious for metastasis. This lesion is amenable for biopsy 
under CT 
guidance, if necessary. 
4. Enlarged necrotic lymph nodes at the left external iliac and 
left common iliac chain, suspicious for nodal metastases. 
5. Cholelithiasis. Small hiatal hernia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo RH M with a history of prostate CA s/p radiation, 
hyperlipidemia, cervical spine disease, and tobacco use who 
presents with left sided weakness and incoordination over the 
last 10 days. In the ED, head CT showed 3 lesions with central 
hemorrhage/necrosis and vasogenic edema in the left frontal 
lobe, left parietal lobe, and most notably in the left 
cerebellar vermis coming close to impinging on the ___ 
ventricle, with no hydrocephalus. CTA head/neck incidentally 
revealed a mass in the right upper lung with adjacent necrotic 
lymph nodes. The findings were highly concerning for metastatic 
cancer. 

# HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Neurology service for 
further workup. MRI brain confirmed presence of hemorrhagic 
metastases in the left frontal and parietal lobes and left 
cerebellar hemisphere with small amount of vasogenic edema. CT 
torso revealed multiple lesions concerning for metastatic cancer 
-- enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, 1.4cm RUL nodule and 
multiple other pulmonary nodules, 2 liver lesions, solid lesion 
posterior to the left psoas, and enlarged necrotic left iliac 
lymph nodes. Given his smoking history and distribution of the 
lesions, findings were highly suspicious for metastatic lung 
cancer. 

The next day an endobronchial biopsy of the right lung and LNs 
was obtained by Interventional Pulmonology (results pending on 
discharge). Hematology-Oncology, Neuro-Oncology, Neurosurgery 
and Radiation Oncology services consulted for workup and 
planning. Given the size of the cerebellar mass and its close 
proximity to the ___ ventricle, it was felt that patient would 
need whole brain radiation (fractionated radiotherapy to the 
area would cause too much swelling and thus hydrocephalus, and 
surgical resection would be unsafe given his age and 
comorbidities). After much debate, it was decided that he needed 
EVD placed before beginning whole brain XRT since risk for 
subsequent edema and hydrocephalus was still high. This will be 
performed one week after discharge, on ___ -- 
patient will be called beforehand with time and name of 
neurosurgeon doing the procedure. Following EVD placement, he 
will see Radiation Oncology (Dr. ___ in clinic to begin 
planning for whole-brain radiation. They anticipate beginning 
XRT one week after surgery in order to allow superficial wound 
healing. 

Patient was started on Dexamethasone 4mg qAM (with GI 
prophylaxis) in the hospital for additional for additional 
protection against vasogenic edema. He was also given oxycodone 
on discharge for left hip pain caused by metastases to the area, 
which cause him significant discomfort. 

At the time of discharge, results of the lung biopsy are still 
pending. Once they return, Heme-Onc will coordinate follow up 
and planning for systemic therapy in the appropriate clinic 
(most likely Thoracic Oncology, given high suspicion that this 
is lung cancer). 

Patient was seen by Social Work in the hospital to address 
coping with his new diagnosis and for assistance obtaining 
long-term disability and transportation to future appointments 
at ___. 

====================

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Masses in brain, lungs, liver and inguinal lymph nodes 
concerning for metastatic cancer 

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Neuro exam = dysmetria on left FNF, incoordination of fine 
finger movements on left, mildly wide based gait. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for new clumsiness and 
weakness on the left side of your body. An MRI of your brain 
showed 3 masses concerning for metastatic cancer, one of which 
was in an area called the CEREBELLUM and carries a high risk for 
causing brain cancer (HYDROCEPHALUS). A subsequent CT scan of 
your torso showed masses in your lymph nodes, lungs and liver 
also concerning for cancer. A lung biopsy was performed, results 
pending. 

The next step in your care will be to start whole brain 
radiation. Before this, you will need a ventriculo-peritoneal 
(VP) shunt. This will be done on ___. You will 
be called by the Neurosurgery apartment with the name of the 
surgeon who will perform the operation and the time of surgery. 

Approximately 3 days after shunt placement, you should attend 
your follow-up appointment with Radiation Oncology. They will 
coordination your radiation plan, as well as your follow-up 
appointments with Neuro-Oncology (___). You will be 
called by them to schedule this appointment in the next few 
days.

You are scheduled for an outpatient with Medical Oncology (Dr. 
___ on ___ to discuss the results of your lung 
biopsy, which should have returned by them. See below for more 
info. They will plan your systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or 
radiation) once the lung biopsy results have returned. 

We made the following changes to your medications: 
1. STARTED Dexamethasone (Decadron) 4mg by mouth in AM -- this 
is to treat swelling of the brain due to cancer. 
2. STARTED Famotidine 20mg twice daily -- this is to prevent 
acid reflux caused by Decadron. 
3. STARTED Oxycodone 2.5-5mg every 6 hrs as needed for pain -- 
side effects include nausea and constipation. Can take over the 
counter laxative as needed.
4. STARTED Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg every 8 hrs as needed for 
nausea -- if experienced as side effect of oxycodone. 
 
Followup Instructions:

","||startoftext|| The patient is a 64-year-old male who presented with left-sided weakness and incoordination over the last 10 days. He has a history of prostate cancer, hyperlipidemia, cervical spine disease, and longstanding tobacco use. He reports having had ""the flu"" six weeks ago, which resolved, but then began to experience muscle aches again, which spread to his bilateral quadriceps, calves, and triceps. He also noticed intermittent vertigo, which was felt to be most likely peripheral. His weakness and incoordination progressed, and he began to experience difficulty controlling his left arm and leg, which felt weak and clumsy. He has fallen twice in the last week and has noticed that his left leg has ""given out"" on him. 

The patient was found to have left-sided weakness and ataxia on examination and was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. He also reports one episode of headache last week, which resolved on its own, and brief blurring of vision in his left eye, which also resolved. 

The patient's past medical history includes hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, cervical disc herniation, and longstanding tobacco use. He has a family history of brain cancer and stroke. 

On physical examination, the patient was found to have normal vital signs, and his neurological examination revealed normal mental status, cranial nerves, and sensation, but decreased sensation in the left ulnar distribution. He had significant dysmetria on left finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin testing, and his gait was mildly wide-based. 

The patient was diagnosed with [insert diagnosis], and he was prescribed [insert medications] at discharge. ||endoftext||"

pneumothorax or increasing pleural effusion is identified. 
Bibasilar left more than right atelectasis is unchanged.

___ ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous 
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left 
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is 
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No 
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right 
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the 
body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage. 
2. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt 
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. 
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal for the patient's body 
size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are 
consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. 
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. 
5. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are 
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve 
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic 
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. 
7. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. 
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. Well-seated 
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. Mild residual 
stenosis, no paravalvular leak. Atrial septum intact without 
visible shunt. Biventricular systolic function is preserved. 
Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels, and 
aortic valve replacement with a 21mm ___ Porcine valve 
and a PFO closure. Please see operative note for details. 
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive 
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mrs. 
___ awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She 
awoke mildly confused but slowly cleared mentally. She was 
transfused with two units of packed red blood cells for 
postoperative anemia. Mrs. ___ developed atrial 
fibrillation for which amioadrone and coumadin was started. On 
postoperative day two, she was transferred to the step down unit 
for further recovery. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were 
resumed. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative 
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted to assist 
with her postoperative strength and mobility. She became 
confused and was pancultured given her WBC of 20. Her INR rose 
quickly to 3.6. Her confusion improved and her INR stabilized 
and she was ready for discharge home on POD #6.
