Her neurological examination was grossly intact, and her cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm with a III/VI diastolic murmur at the aortic position.","This patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with dyspnea on exertion due to dyspnea, which led to being admitted into the hospital due to progressive aortic insufficiency. Relevant pieces of her past medical history include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, previous heart failure, coronary interventions including PCI and CABG, previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, peripheral vascular disease, peripheral vascular interventions including angioplasty and bypass grafting, chronic kidney disease stage IV, heart failure stage IV, current use of beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, antiplatelet agents including aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel, current use of anticoagulation therapy including heparin and low molecular weight heparin, current use of beta agonist therapy including albuterol, current use of bronchodilator therapy, current use of inhalers including salmeterol and tiotropium, current respiratory symptoms worsening over months due to COPD exacerbations, gastroenterological problems including GERD symptoms worsening since pregnancy, depression symptoms worsening since pregnancy, symptoms suggesting possible liver dysfunction since last menstrual period. Other notable conditions are sleep apnea diagnosed since first trimester but treatment began third trimester due to concerns regarding safety from folic acid supplementation, vitamin deficiencies, especially vitamin K deficiency given lack of folate supplementation, psoriasis since childhood, psoriatic arthritis since childhood, possible liver mass as indicated by elevated liver enzymes previously reported before starting anticoagulant therapy; however this finding does not appear clinically significant given absence of jaundice symptoms; therefore it may represent incidental finding that warrants ongoing surveillance rather than significant clinical concern, and possible polypoid mass as indicated by rectosigmoidoscopy performed before discontinuing warfarin treatment; however this finding may represent incidental mass given location within rectosigmoid region rather significant clinical concern.

Patient Profile:
This 49-year-old female presented due to complex regional pain syndrome, right lower extremity pain, despite previous inadequate management. Relevant past medical history includes refractory reflux sympathetic dystrophy requiring numerous surgical interventions including two spinal cord stimulators; neurological conditions; mental health disorders; musculoskeletal issues; and several previous obstetric surgeries. Upon admission, her primary complaint remains right lower extremity pain. Physical exam revealed severe hyperesthesia and pain limited to the right lower limb. During the hospital stay, she required surgical intervention for IPG wire placement/revision due to suspected inadequate positioning of previous wire due to significant scar tissue accumulation under existing wire. Following the surgical procedure, management involved managing severe pain through various analgesics including PCA and eventually transitioning to oral opioids, NSAIDs, and anti-inflammatory agents. Upon discharge, clear-headed and alert without neurological deficits, and instructed to avoid heavy exertion, avoid getting the wound site wet, manage potential side effects of oral opioids carefully while adhering to a regular bowel routine using laxatives and anti-diarrheals."

On admission, her physical exam revealed subtle anisocoria, left facial droop, and left drift. She was diagnosed with a right temporoparietal brain mass and underwent a right craniotomy for resection. During her hospital stay, she developed hypertension, elevated INR, and low platelets, which were managed with medications. She also experienced anxiety and paranoia, which were treated with steroids and Xanax. At the time of discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating without difficulty, and had stable vital signs.

She was discharged to an extended care facility.","The patient is a 56-year-old female who came into the hospital due to clumsiness and falls, presenting with symptoms such as clumsy left hand, inability to type due to paralysis, and complaints of headache. Relevant historical features includes a previous diagnosis of benign ovarian mass resection, etoh-induced cirrhosis, and asthma. Physical examination revealed subtle anisocoria, weakness in motor functions, decreased sensation on the left side, and significant motor function deficits including inability to lift hands above shoulders due to drift. During her hospitalization, the patient required several surgeries due to significant intracranial masses affecting motor function including massive right temporo-parietal tumors treated via right craniectomy followed by stabilization via posterior fossa drain removal.



She underwent IV dexamethasone and Keppra followed by MRI and has since stabilized and recovered sufficiently enough to receive extended care.



Her current conditions were assessed under clear consciousness, and level of consciousness assessed as clear.



She has a variety of medications including acetaminophen for mild constipation, alprazolam for anxiety.



Her care team provided extensive guidance regarding activities after recovery.

He has a history of extensive peripheral vascular disease, including a left common femoral to posterior tibial artery bypass graft, and has undergone several debridements of ulcers on his feet, followed by a below-knee amputation on his right side. He has also had balloon angioplasty of his left common femoral to posterior tibial artery vein graft.

The patient's past medical history includes coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, and anemia.

The patient underwent a diagnostic left lower extremity angiogram and was found to have patent left femoral to posterior tibial bypass with mildly elevated velocities at the distal anastomosis, suggesting the possibility of moderate stenosis.

At discharge, the patient's medications included amiodarone, nitroglycerin, Levothyroxine, Gabapentin, Fluticasone, B Complex-Vitamin C-Folic Acid, Carvedilol, Citalopram, Oxycodone-Acetaminophen, Lactulose, Lisinopril, Lorazepam, omeprazole, Sevelamer HCl, Simvastatin, Aspirin, Docusate Sodium, Acetaminophen, insulin, and Coumadin.

He was also advised to elevate his legs above the level of his heart, avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting, and drink plenty of fluids.","The patient, Mr., is 74-year-old man presenting for reevaluation of his left lower extremity ischemia. His past medical histories reveal significant cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and chronic renal impairment (CRI). The Chief Complaint relates to continued ischemia despite previous interventions. On Physical Examination, vital signs revealed fever-free status but the presence of somnolence during initial hospitalization post-surgery resolved within few moments after intervention. During hospital stay, patient underwent diagnostic lumenoscopy (LLA angiography) procedures for re-evaluation of arterial obstruction causing limb ischemia, diagnostic lumenoscopy procedures revealed mildly elevated velocity values indicating potential stenosis at graft sites. Upon discharge, there were minor laboratory abnormalities such as mildly elevated serum creatinine levels but overall stable vital signs during assessment.
