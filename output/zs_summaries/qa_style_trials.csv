During her hospital stay, she underwent removal of her peritoneal dialysis catheter and placement of a tunneled hemodialysis line. She experienced chest pain and was treated with sublingual nitroglycerine and full-strength aspirin. Her troponins were found to be higher than her baseline, but her EKG was unchanged. She was started on losartan and prn isosorbide for blood pressure control. 

At discharge, the patient was prescribed several medications, including carvedilol, losartan, and prn isosorbide for blood pressure control, as well as medications for her other medical conditions. She was advised to follow up with her cardiologist and Dr. ___ as an outpatient.","This patient, a 71-year-old female, presented with complaints related to chronic kidney disease requiring peritoneal dialysis, likely exacerbated by repeated episodes of peritoneal dialysis catheter-related infections despite recent antibiotic therapy. Relevant to their past medical history includes chronic kidney disease (stage V) secondary to hypertension and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myeloma-related anaemia, obesity, GERD, among others. Upon admission, their vital signs showed a slight hypotension without acute distress, while their general appearance indicated frailty without immediate distress. Their physical exam revealed minor tenderness over the previous PD catheter insertion site without current distressing symptoms; notable cardiovascular assessment revealed a mild systolic heart murmur without other abnormalities; respiratory system showed clear lungs; neurologic assessment indicated absence of neurological deficits; laboratory results reflected stable electrolyte balance except for mildly elevated urea levels indicative of renal function decline; serum calcium levels also slightly below normal range; however, other tests like troponins remained stable despite initial elevation during postoperative period indicating possible post-procedure angina without overt concern. The patient underwent successful removal of their peritoneal dialysis catheter followed by successful dialysis session through a newly inserted tunneled vascular access catheter; there were transient episodes of angina during hospital stay necessitating cardiology consultation and adjustment of antihypertensives to manage blood pressure elevation leading to anginal episodes. Following successful stabilization, cardiology recommended continued management without immediate intervention to continue managing symptoms. Finally, the patient underwent successful removal of previous PD catheter, followed by insertion of new vascular access for future dialysis sessions.


Upon successful completion of the procedure without complications, the patient was provided with comprehensive care plan outlining necessary adjustments to management regimen, close monitoring, and necessary lifestyle modifications aimed at optimizing overall health status.
