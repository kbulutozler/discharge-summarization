###SUMMARY: 
This 52-year-old male patient presented with chronic worsening joint pain and excessive fatigue over the past two weeks.
His medical history includes acute myeloid leukemia (AML), status post allogeneic stem cell transplant complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the joints.
He was previously managed on tacrolimus and plaquenil but stopped them due to side effects.
During the admission, his prednisone was increased to 20mg daily, and oxycontin was restarted at 10mg BID.
Additionally, keflex was prescribed for a minor toe infection, and colace and senna were initiated for constipation.
The patient's pain, fatigue, and nausea improved during the hospital stay, and he was discharged home with follow-up instructions.
Notably, he experienced an episode of hypotension possibly related to high-dose narcotics.
Long-term management of his GVHD requires discussion with his primary care physician.



###SUMMARY: 
This 91-year-old woman presented with a three-day history of right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and fever, raising concerns about cholangitis.
Her past medical history includes dementia, anxiety, type II diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease with a stented left anterior descending artery, and a papillary neoplasm of the ampulla of Vater.
On examination, she was found to have tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of dehydration, which responded to fluid resuscitation.
Laboratory tests revealed abnormal liver enzymes, indicating transaminitis.
Imaging studies demonstrated common bile duct dilation and gallbladder sludge, suggesting cholangitis.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography pancreatography (ERCP) was performed, revealing multiple stents and allowing for their successful removal, extraction of sludge and stones, and replacement with two new stents.
Antibiotics were administered to treat both cholangitis and suspected pneumonia.
During her hospital stay, she experienced episodes of atrial flutter and required adjustments to her medication regimen.
At discharge, she was considered stable enough to return home with ongoing care services.</BEGIN_SUMMARY>


###SUMMARY: 
This 53-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department after experiencing a brief loss of consciousness followed by a fall.
Her medical history includes end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, polysubstance abuse currently treated with methadone, hypertension, migraine headaches, spinal stenosis, hepatitis C, seizure disorders, depression, and hypothyroidism.
Upon evaluation, she was found to be hypothyroid with a low free thyroxine level and hypoglycemic with a glucose level of 45.
Additionally, she complained of diarrhea and blurred vision.
Laboratory results revealed mildly elevated troponin levels, which were attributed to her kidney disease rather than a myocardial infarction.
Imaging studies, including electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, computed tomography scans of the head, and chest X-rays, were largely unrevealing.
During her hospital course, she underwent dialysis, received fluids and electrolytes, and was started on levothyroxine for her hypothyroidism.
At discharge, her medications included fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler, calcium carbonate, fluoxetine, folic acid, levetiracetam, aspirin, trazodone, and levothyroxine.
Follow-up appointments were scheduled with her primary care physician and nephrologist.

###SUMMARY: 
This 51-year-old female presented with right flank pain and 
was found to have multiple obstructing stones causing hydronephrosis 
and acute kidney injury.
She underwent cystoscopy and ureteral 
stent placement.
Her past medical history includes HIV/AIDS, 
seizure disorder, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
oral candidiasis, fibroids, tonsillitis, anemia, and transient ischemic attack. 

Her social history is unremarkable.
The patient's physical exam revealed 
minimal flank tenderness.
Laboratory results showed mild anemia 
with normal electrolyte levels.
Imaging studies demonstrated 
right-sided hydronephrosis caused by multiple obstructing stones. 

She was discharged home with prescriptions for oxycodone, 
nausea medication, and potassium citrate to help pass the remaining 
stone.
Follow-up appointments were scheduled with urology and 
her primary care physician.

###SUMMARY: 
This 69-year-old male patient presented with a right groin wound dehiscence and Streptococcus anginosus/Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia.
He underwent surgical interventions, including exploratory laparotomy, control of the external iliac artery, excision of the distal portion of the axillary-femoral bypass, and vein patch repair of the femoral artery.
He developed complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome, requiring additional surgeries.
The patient was discharged to extended care with instructions for wound management, antibiotic suppression therapy, and follow-up appointments.
Key diagnoses include infected right femoral axillary bypass, retroperitoneal and intra-abdominal bleeding, abdominal compartment syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, atrial valve replacement (AVR) mechanical valve, acute renal failure on chronic renal failure, and failure to thrive.
