###SUMMARY: 
In summary, the patient is a 69-year-old male presenting with obstructive jaundice and weight loss due to suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
His significant past medical histories include myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, spinal stenosis, GERD, tonsillectomy as a childhood event, thrombectomies, and aortic stenting.
His admission symptoms included an obstructive jaundice and weight loss, prompting an emergency exploration and then a planned elective Whipple procedure that was subsequently canceled due to discovery of metastases to the liver.
Following aborting the planned Whipple procedure, an exploratory laparotomy and subsequent diagnostic procedures confirmed an adenocarcinoma of the uncinate process.
He had then undergone an Emergency Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), where a biliary stent was placed below an obstruction caused by a tumor.
Upon recovery, he recovered remarkably with minimal complications and returned home on the same conditions with post-operative pain managed appropriately.  


###SUMMARY: 
The patient is 58-year-old female who came to the hospital because of dyspnea on exertion due to suspected aortic insufficiency.
Relevant pieces of their past medical history include conditions such as aortic insufficiency, aortic aneurysm, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, liver mass, psoriasis, vitamin D deficiency, meniscus repair, polypotomy of vocal cords, sacral nerve/bladder stimulator, and meniscal repair.
Their symptoms included dyspnea on exertion, which worsened over time due to suspected progressive aortic insufficiency.
On physical examination, patients had warm skin with multiple purpuras and bruises on arms and legs but overall appeared comfortable awake and alert with minor complaints of sternum pain and faint breath sounds in the chest.
During admission, patients underwent a successful valve sparing aortic root replacement procedure using a 28-mm Valsalva graft under general anesthesia due to progressive valvular heart disease leading to significant dyspnea and fatigue which affected the quality of life significantly.
Upon discharge patients would take aspirin, metformin, ranitidine, clonaczapam for anxiety management; beta blockers metoprolol tartrate would start to manage heart rate variability; ranitidine would help prevent stomach ulcers and ranizidine could help prevent stomach ulcers as well.
At home patients should take acetaminophen regularly for pain management, avoid heavy lifts, maintain proper posture and proper positioning, keep wounds clean and redressed properly without applying creams oils lotions powders etc.
They should avoid lying flat which may increase swelling.
Patients can resume walking but should avoid heavy exercise for six months due to swelling risk.
They can resume light exercise gradually within six months depending upon how quickly swelling decreases.  


###SUMMARY: 
A 27-year-old female patient was hospitalized due to severe thrombocytopenia resulting from Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), requiring emergency admission due to the impossibility of performing surgery due to very low platelet counts (<5).
