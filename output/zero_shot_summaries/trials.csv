"The patient is a 52-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with worsening joint pain. He has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has undergone a myeloablative double cord blood transplant. He has been experiencing chronic joint pain since his transplant, which has worsened over the past two weeks. The patient has been taking oxycodone for pain control, but has recently decreased his dosage due to nausea and vomiting. He has also been experiencing fever, fatigue, and swelling in his joints.

The patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of AML, sarcoidosis, and chronic GVHD. He has undergone several treatments for his AML, including induction therapy, consolidation therapy, and relapse treatment. He has also received Rituxan for his chronic GVHD.

The patient's physical examination revealed a middle-aged, Cushingoid, overweight man with bilateral 2+ pitting edema to his knees. His joints were tender to palpation, and he had ecchymoses on his abdomen. His laboratory results showed an elevated CRP level, indicating an inflammatory process.

The patient's diagnosis is chronic GVHD with joint pain, likely due to a combination of GVHD and changes in his narcotics regimen. His treatment plan includes increasing his prednisone dosage and discontinuing his plaquinil medication.","This 52-year-old male patient presented with chronic worsening joint pain and excessive fatigue over the past two weeks. His medical history includes acute myeloid leukemia (AML), status post allogeneic stem cell transplant complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the joints. He was previously managed on tacrolimus and plaquenil but stopped them due to side effects. During the admission, his prednisone was increased to 20mg daily, and oxycontin was restarted at 10mg BID. Additionally, keflex was prescribed for a minor toe infection, and colace and senna were initiated for constipation. The patient's pain, fatigue, and nausea improved during the hospital stay, and he was discharged home with follow-up instructions. Notably, he experienced an episode of hypotension possibly related to high-dose narcotics. Long-term management of his GVHD requires discussion with his primary care physician.

"The patient is a 91-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of RUQ pain and fevers. She has a history of dementia, hypertension, CAD, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a papillary neoplasm of the ampulla of Vater. She was previously treated for cholangitis with biliary stents and presented to the hospital with 3 days of fever, RUQ pain, and jaundice. She was found to have elevated liver enzymes and underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed debris and stones in the bile duct. She was treated with antibiotics and had a successful outcome.

The patient's past medical history includes dementia, anxiety, DM2, HLD, HTN, atrial fibrillation, papillary neoplasm of the ampulla of Vater, CAD, and cholangitis. She has no known allergies or adverse reactions.

The patient's diagnosis was acute cholangitis, transaminitis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and pneumonia. She underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed debris and stones in the bile duct, and was treated with antibiotics.

The patient's medications at discharge included cefpodoxime and metronidazole for a planned seven-day course to cover both cholangitis and possible pneumonia.","This 91-year-old woman presented with a three-day history of right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and fever, raising concerns about cholangitis. Her past medical history includes dementia, anxiety, type II diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease with a stented left anterior descending artery, and a papillary neoplasm of the ampulla of Vater. On examination, she was found to have tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of dehydration, which responded to fluid resuscitation. Laboratory tests revealed abnormal liver enzymes, indicating transaminitis. Imaging studies demonstrated common bile duct dilation and gallbladder sludge, suggesting cholangitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography pancreatography (ERCP) was performed, revealing multiple stents and allowing for their successful removal, extraction of sludge and stones, and replacement with two new stents. Antibiotics were administered to treat both cholangitis and suspected pneumonia. During her hospital stay, she experienced episodes of atrial flutter and required adjustments to her medication regimen. At discharge, she was considered stable enough to return home with ongoing care services.</BEGIN_SUMMARY>"
"The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a brief loss of consciousness and subsequent fall. She has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to hypertensive nephropathy, and has undergone a renal transplant. She also has a history of substance abuse, depression, and hypothyroidism. On physical examination, her vital signs were stable, and she had no signs of acute distress. Laboratory results showed mild anemia, elevated creatinine, and hypocalcemia. The patient was diagnosed with a syncopal episode and was treated with IV fluids and dialysis. She was also prescribed medications for her hypertension and hypothyroidism.","This 53-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department after experiencing a brief loss of consciousness followed by a fall. Her medical history includes end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, polysubstance abuse currently treated with methadone, hypertension, migraine headaches, spinal stenosis, hepatitis C, seizure disorders, depression, and hypothyroidism. Upon evaluation, she was found to be hypothyroid with a low free thyroxine level and hypoglycemic with a glucose level of 45. Additionally, she complained of diarrhea and blurred vision. Laboratory results revealed mildly elevated troponin levels, which were attributed to her kidney disease rather than a myocardial infarction. Imaging studies, including electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, computed tomography scans of the head, and chest X-rays, were largely unrevealing. During her hospital course, she underwent dialysis, received fluids and electrolytes, and was started on levothyroxine for her hypothyroidism. At discharge, her medications included fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler, calcium carbonate, fluoxetine, folic acid, levetiracetam, aspirin, trazodone, and levothyroxine. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with her primary care physician and nephrologist.
