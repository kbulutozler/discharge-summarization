CT Abdomen and Pelvis (IV Contrast):
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. Atelectasis within the lingula is additionally 
noted. 
An amorphous area low attenuation is identified within segment 
IVb of the 
liver. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, 
spleen, 
pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear within normal 
limits. The 
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally. A 
3-cm low- 
attenuation lesion at the lower pole of the right kidney is 
consistent with a simple cyst. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
of the infrarenal abdominal aorta is evident.   
There is thickening of the cecum and significant pericecal 
stranding of 
mesenteric fat. Surgical clips at the site of appendectomy are 
noted. No 
evidence of abscess or loculated fluid. A small amount of free 
fluid in this area, which also tracks down into the pelvis is 
seen. Although the distal ileum is not well distended with oral 
contrast, there is a suggestion of bowel wall thickening/edema 
and stranding of the surrounding mesenteric fat. No organized 
fluid collection is evident, however. There is no evidence of 
bowel obstruction as contrast has passed through to the rectum. 
There is no free air within the abdomen. Although the colon is 
not distended, there is a suggestion of diffuse colonic wall 
thickening. 
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, 
intrapelvic 
loops of small bowel are unremarkable. A Foley balloon is 
present within a 
decompressed bladder. A small amount of free fluid is evident 
within the 
pelvis. Small, bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are 
evident. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Inflammatory process appears to be centered in the ileocecal 
area at the site of recent appendectomy. No organized or 
drainable intra-abdominal fluid collection. Assessment is 
somewhat limited by lack of distal ileal distention with oral 
contrast. A small amount of free fluid and scattered subjacent 
lymph nodes are additionally evident.  
2. Equivocal diffuse colonic wall thickening. This finding 
raises the 
possibility of colitis and and infectious process such as C. 
difficile should be considered.   
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal 
akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the 
basal half of the inferior wall. There is minimal hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %). The estimated cardiac 
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w ischemia. Left pleural effusion. 
.
ECG ___: normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in 
leads III, AVF
.
PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
final blood cultures from ___ (no growth to date)
stool cultures, O&P from ___. SEPSIS:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an outside hospital with 
hypotension, on Levophed with an elevated WBC count of 22.6 on 
admission.  The source of infection was not clear on admission 
and differential included infection from recurrent abscesses at 
appendectomy site or C. Diff colitis.  Other etiology considered 
was reaction to CT contrast.  Was started on Vanocmycin, Zosyn 
and Flagyl in the MICU.  He remained hemodynamically stable and 
afebrile and Levophed was stopped on the day of transfer for 
MAP>65, SvO2 72, CVP 6 and good urine output.  CT showed 
inflammation prior appendectomy site without fluid collection.  
Surgery was consulted and did not recommend surgery.  
Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended 48 hours of IV 
antibiotics for presumed GI infection, then 3 weeks of PO 
antibiotics.  Cultures were obtained on ___ from ___ 
___ and showed no growth to date of blood or urine 
cultures.  Blood and urine cultures collected at ___ 
showed no growth to date.  C. Diff X 3 were negative.  The 
patient continued to do well and was trasnferred to the general 
medical floor on ___.  He was continued on IV antibiotics 
and then changed to PO antibiotics on ___.  He was put on 
Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID and Metronidazole 500mg PO TID and 
was discharged with 16 more days of antibiotics.  He will 
___ with his PCP ___ 1 week.  Another possible etiology for 
his symptoms that was considered was anaphylaxis from PO 
contrast from the CT scan, although this was less likely given 
that he has had PO contrast in the past without problems.  We 
recommended that he see an allergist as an outpatient to assess 
the possibility of an allergic reaction to PO contrast.

who presents with cough and shortness of breath
.  
#  Cough- Patient was recently admitted with similar symptoms at 
___ and was discharged with a course of augmentin and 
doxycycline for CAP, which she completed.  However, prior to 
admission, she developed cough associated with shortness of 
breath so she presented to ___.   In the ED, she was febrile 
with possible early pneumonia on CXR, so she received a dose of 
ceftriaxone.  Given that her WBC was normal, and cough was 
non-productive, the patient was not initially treated for HCAP.  
In addition, she has presented like this in the past and was 
treated for a COPD exacerbation.  On admission, she was started 
on azithromycin, prednisone 60mg daily and nebulizers.  Her 
symptoms improved and oxygen requirement was decreasing.  
However, she developed a fever on ___ so she was started on 
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, given recent hospital 
discharge.  She was weaned off oxygen and worked well with 
physical therapy.  Urine legionella was negative.  Blood and 
urine cultures were negative.  Sputum culture was contaminated 
with normal respiratory flora.  The patient completed an 8 day 
course of antibiotics- vancomycin 1gm q48hours, Cefepime 1g q24 
hours via ___ line.  She is being discharged on a prednisone 
taper starting at 30mg daily.  On discharge, cough, shortness of 
breath and oxygen requirement had resolved.  She was able to 
ambulate with no shortness of breath.  The patient was afebrile 
from ___ until discharge, had a normal WBC count and looked 
well.  
.  
#  Fever- Likely secondary to pneumonia.  She lacked other 
symptoms of influenza (myalgias, etc).  Patient's cultures were 
negative.  UA was negative for UTI.  
.
#  COPD- Patient improved with azithromycin, nebulizers and 
steroids.  She was weaned off oxygen and is being discharged on 
a prednisone taper, starting at 30mg daily for 14 additional 
days of therapy
.  
#  Atrial fibrillation- Continued home amiodarone and 
metoprolol.  Heart rate was regular and was well-controlled.  
Her INR trended up to 4.3 so she was cut down from 2mg 3x/week 
to 0.5 or 1.0mg daily (pending INR) given that she is on 
antibiotics and amiodarone.  As mentioned, her INR peaked at 4.3 
but then trended down.  We resumed her at 2mg daily on ___ 
when INR was 1.7.  Subsequent trend was 1.7 -> 1.5 -> 1.6.  She 
received 2mg of coumadin on ___.  We have 
instructed her to resume her prior regimen on discharge meaning 
she will take 2mg on ___ and 1mg on ___.  We also asked the 
patient to have an INR check on ___ and to please fax the 
results to her PCP for instruction on management of coumadin 
dosing.  
.  
#  Diastolic CHF- The patient has a known history of chronic 
diastolic heart failure.  On admission, there were no signs of 
fluid overload on exam.  Her oxygen requirement was attributed 
to pneumonia and COPD exerbation.  Given her elevated creatinine 
on admission, her lasix and lisinopril were initially held.  Her 
creatinine improved so we resumed her lisinopril at 20mg daily.  
By discharge, we resumed home dose of lisinopril.  Once 
creatinine stabilized, home dose of lasix was resumed and 
patient's creatinine remained stable.  She was discharged on 
home dose of lasix 20mg daily and has ___ with Dr. ___ 
on ___.
.
#  CAD- The patient did not present with chest pain.  Her EKGs 
were consistent with prior.  She was continued on her home 
statin and beta-blocker.  
.
#  Hypertension- As mentioned above, her lisinopril was 
initially held given ___ but was resumed at home dose by 
discharge.  She was continued on the remainder of her home 
medications- imdur 30mg daily, metoprolol 50mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg daily.  BP's were remained stable. 
.
#  Numbness- On the last day of admission, patient revealed to 
us that she had been experiencing numbness in her fingertips 
(all of them).  Exam did not demonstrate any sensory or motor 
deficit as patient has ___ strength in all 4 extremities with 
intact sensation bilaterally.  She is not a diabetic.  Other 
possible etiologies include b12 deficiency, radiculopathy, or 
vasculitis.  Given that her symptoms are in both hands with only 
the DIP joint affected, a cervical radiculopathy is unlikely.  
She has no other systemic symptoms suggestive of vasculitis 
(skin changes, fever, chills) and her labwork is benign.  No 
indication for imaging as remainder of neurological exam is 
intact, including gait.  This also could be due to a medication 
as she received IV antibiotics.  B12 level checked and pending 
at the time of discharge, but, given description of symptoms, 
will likely not be the etiology behind this numbness.  We ask 
that the patient's PCP ___ on this issue when she sees the 
patient on ___.
.

colace, pain management with tylenol

Blood Cultures routine and mycolytic NGTD at time of D/C

CXR:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no focal pneumonia 
or 
interstitial prominence to suggest PCP. 

U/S liver: 
1. Thickened gallbladder wall with no gallstones. Thick-walled 
bile ducts 
with no biliary dilatation. The appearance of these structures 
is consistent 
with HIV choliangiopathy. 
2. Focal fat seen within the liver.  
3. Mild splenomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ AIDS off HAART for 15 months presents w/ malaise, 
anemia.
.
#HIV: Pt. has had poor reactions to ARV Tx in the past (stopped 
taking because of nausea w/ ritonavir), pt. restarted on ARV w/ 
attention to this. Pt. did well w/ no N/V after taking ritonavir 
at HS. Blood cultures were drawn for bacteria, mycobacteria and 
fungi and were no growth to date on day of D/C. Continued 
dapsone ppx, but considered switching to atovaquone because of 
hemolytic anemia, Hct remained stable so we kept pt. on dapsone.

.
#Abdominal pain: Pt. has Hx of bowel wall ulcer, this seems 
probable as his tenderness is extremely localized, has not been 
progressive. Likely he does not have acute bacterial issue as he 
is non septic and this has been present for a long time. He has 
been scoped before w/ conflicting path results (negative CMV Cx 
but a few inclusions),consider CMV colitis, Consider HSV 
colitis, Consider parasitic ___. Dr. ___ 
performed the endoscopy felt that the ulcer looked like it was 
from CMV and so pt. was empirically started on IV gancyclovir 
and then transitioned to PO valgancyclovir after 2 days. The 
abdominal pain seemed to improve slightly day to day. Pt. had 
elevated alk phos, GGT, Tbili so liver U/S was performed and wet 
read was consistent w/ HIV cholangiopathy.
.
#Anemia: Appears to be hemolytic as haptoglobin was decreased to 
<20 and retic count is elevated. Elevated retic count (not 
appropriately elevated given low Hbg) suggests that there is a 
lack of production. He recieved 2 units of PRBCs and his Hct 
increased to above 25 and remained stable after transfusion, on 
day of d/c was 24.9. Likely that he is no longer hemolyzing, but 
unknown whether his marrow is responding at time of d/c. There 
was significant concern that the lack of marrow response 
represented a marrow infiltrative process so a BMB was obtained. 
Results of BMB were pending at D/C.
.
#Fever: Likely OI as pt. has no other focal signs of infection. 
Could be drug fever as pt. recently started on gancyclovir and 
ARV's, the fevers did not appear until the night after the 
gancyclovir was started and continued to wax and wane and he had 
a temperature to 100.8 the night before d/c. CXR, UA, Ucx, Blood 
Cx X3 sets routine Negative so far. Pt. to f/u w/ Dr. ___ 
results of BMB and mycolytic blood cultures.
.
#Fatigue: likely ___ anemia, but may also be due to chronic OI 
and/or HIV wasting syndrome as pt. appeared quite cachectic. 
Nutrition was consulted and recommended ensure supplementation, 
but pt. did not like ensure and made this clear to nutrition, 
ensure was seen unopened on pt.s tray every morning.
.
#Diarrhea: Likely ___ OI, differential is quite wide: crypto, 
giardia, ___, CMV, C. diff. All previous wkup 
was negative in ___.  Likely etiology is an OI which will be 
treated by increasing his CD4 count. Repeat stool studies were 
negative for o/p, ___, crypto, giardia, cyclospora.
.
#Hyponatremia: Possibly secondary to diarrhea with free water 
replacement or SIADH from chronic pain. Most likelly from 
diarrhea. Urine lytes, Cr, Osm inconclusive for SIADH vs. volume 
depletion. FeNa was 1.6. Pt. remained asymptomatic and recieved 
no specific treatment.
.
#Elevated alk phos: Likely bile duct source as GGT also 
elevated. Pt. also complaining of RUQ pain and tenderness, has 
previous history of U/S which showed cholelithiasis. Liver U/S 
did not show stones in duct, wet read was consistent with HIV 
cholangiopathy.

ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with a recent admission 
___ ___ for multifocal pneumonia complicated by chronic 
respiratory failure further complicated recurrent PNA x2 at 
rehab s/p trach/PEG, decannulated on ___. She presented for 
this admission with 2 days of dyspnea and productive cough, and 
was found to be hypoxemic requiring high-flow oxygen. CXR showed 
possible pneumonia and completed course of antibiotics 
(Vanc/ceftazidime, Day 1: ___. Her respiratory failure was 
thought to be secondary to recurrent aspiration related to her 
neuromuscular disease. She was given hypertonic saline nebs, 
guaiafenesin, Duonebs, pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve. She 
required intubation, and was unable to be weaned off the 
ventilator. After numerous goals of care discussions with the 
ICU team, her outpatient pulmonologist, palliative care, and her 
family, decision was made to undergo trach/PEG on ___. She 
tolerated this well, and was able to be weaned off the 
ventilator by ___, when she was transferred to floor. Cuff 
pressures were high, but patient had been tolerating this well. 
She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES
-- NEW: senna PRN and Colace PRN constipation
-- HELD: loperamide (as noted above, consider low dose trial if 
she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools. 
[ ] Continue to discuss goals of care with patient  
[ ] Patient will follow up with the interventional 
pulmonologists for further monitoring of her tracheostomy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has allergies to penicillins and oxybutynin. The patient's chief complaint was hypoxia, dyspnea, productive cough, and congestion, which she experienced for the past two days. She was previously intubated and had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was referred to the emergency department for stoma closure and was found to have tachypnea, rhonchorous lungs, and a stoma site. The patient was given various medications, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and cefepime. She was also given oxygen therapy and had a flutter valve inserted. The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, and normal abdominal examination. The patient's laboratory results showed anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Imaging studies revealed extensive atelectasis in the lower lungs, which could not exclude a superimposed pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who initially presented 
with severe abdominal pain. At that time, no obvious findings on 
CT scan and no obvious leak was appreciated. Given her pain and 
significant CT findings, it was decided that she would benefit 
from a diagnostic laparoscopy. At that time, I was concerned 
that she may actually have a gastric perforation and may have a 
gallbladder issue that could potentially be addressed 
laparoscopically. Thus, we decided to start the case 
laparoscopically with potential conversion to an open procedure 
if a significant
lesion in the stomach was appreciated. The risks and benefits of 
the procedure were described in detail to the patient. Despite 
these risks, she chose to proceed with surgery. She was found to 
have a gastric perforation and therefore converted to 
exploratory laparotomy with ___ patch and placement of a 
Pravena vac. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a IV dialudid 
PCA and then transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone 
once tolerating a diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression and nasojejunal 
tube in place for feeding.  On POD2 tube feeding were started 
through the doboff. On POD3 the NGT was accidently  removed by 
the patient when sneezing. She was kept NPO (except tube feeds). 
On POD5 she underwent upper GI leak test that was unclear and 
therefore was repeated on POD7 and negative for leak. Doboff was 
removed and she was given a regular diet with good tolerability. 
H.Pylori result was positive and therefore she was started on 
quadruple therapy once tolerating a diet. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. H.Pylori quadrupal therapy 
started and prescribed 2 week course. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest 
radiographs: 
  
Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces. No 
evidence of 
pneumonia or CHF. 
.
___ Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.   
A patent foramen ovale is present with right to left shunting of 
agitated saline contrast during Valsalva.  
.
___ Lower Extremity doppler ultrasound
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in right or left lower 
extremity.
.
___ Cardiac Catheterisation
Change for 6 ___ XB3 guide.  The initial plan was to pass the
wire as the primary reperfusion device.  A Pilot 50 Wire was
passed in a prolapsed fashion but this did not restore flow. 
Given that the patient was pain free and the small territory at
risk, it was decided to avoid further attempts at recanalization
(with balloon angioplasty) given risk of dissection, 
perforation.
The patient had intermittent chest pain at the end of the
procedure and was started on IV TNG and administered opiates 
with
resolution of chest pain.  He left the laboratory in stable
condition.
.
___ Foot XRay
Three views show the bony structures and joint spaces to be
essentially within normal limits. No dorsal swelling or evidence 
of erosion
is appreciated. No calcaneal spurs.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M w/ PMH of prostate CA, HTN, presenting with distal 
apical NSTEMI.
.
# APICAL LAD STEMI:  Distal LAD thrombosis with distal apical 
infarct, s/p unsuccessful recanalisation during cardiac 
catheterisation.  No other evidence of coronoary atherosclerosis 
was found. Echocardiogram whowed preserved EF and no ventricular 
wall motion abnormalities. However, he was noted to have a 
patent formane ovale.  Given absence of atherosclerotic disease, 
PFO and known CA prostate, thromboembolic event from a possible 
proximal DVT remains a possible etiology for his STEMI.  Cardiac 
enzymes peaked ___ and trended down prior to discharge. He 
was treated with a heparin drip for 2 days after the procedure, 
as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol.  He was started on 
lisinopril and atorvastatin, but these were held in the setting 
of acute kidney injury.  He will need to continue aspirin 
lifelong and clopidogrel for at least one year given his 
prothrombotic state.  Atorvastation was restarted at the time of 
discharge.
.  
# s/p CATH: unsuccessful attempt at wire recanalisation of 
distal LAD.
.
# THROMBOEMBOLISM: Cardiac cath shows no evidence of coronary 
atherosclerosis.  MI site is unusual and patient has PFO, 
history of prostate cancer, prothrombotic state. LENIs were 
negative, but did not include an evaluation of the iliac 
arteries.  He will continue aspirin and plavix for 
anticoagulation following discharge.  
.
# Fever: Etiology unclear. UA, CXR clear.  Urine cultures and 
blood cultures pending.  However, timing of fever suggests 
possible link with gout flare.  Other etiologies include: 
infection, post-MI, thromboembolism/PE, B-symptoms from cancer. 
His fever curve trended down spontaneously prior to discharge.
.
# Thigh pain - bilateral. Could be from strenous workout pt 
reports. CKs coming down but CK so out of proportion elevated 
compared to MB. We just started statin which can cause myopathy 
but states thigh pain since presentation. Pt without significant 
CAD that we know of.  We held his statin, but restarted it at 
the time of discharge.
.
# ___: Cr of 1.4 on ___ up from baseline of 1.0.  Could be 
secondary to high 
CK. Uric acid was 6.6, urinalysis was clear.  We gave him a 
small fluid bolus. 
.
# Right ankle pain - Most likely gout flair. pt with history of 
gout. A foot Xray was performed which showed no pathology.  His 
pain was controlled with percocet and colchicine.   
.  
# HTN: BP was high on presentation and he was initially on a 
nitro drip, but this was rapidly weaned and he was treated with 
metoprolol instead.  He was also started on lisinopril, but this 
was held given ___. He will need reevaluation
.
# Cardiac Risk factors: patient has hypertension.
Lipid panel was unremarkable.  HbA1C was pending at the time of 
discharge.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ACE inhibitor was held due to creatinine 
elevation.
Please reassess hypertension and creatinine as an outpatient and 
consider restarting an ACE inhibitor if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted with a heart 
attack. We performed a cardiac catheterization which showed a 
small blockage in the blood supply to the apex of your heart, 
but no other abnormalities in the blood flow to your heart.  We 
attempted to open this blockage, but were unable to do so and 
did not attempy further since the reduction of heart function 
was very small.  An echocardiogram was performed and this 
confirmed that your heart was beating normally.  The 
echocardiogram also showed that you have an open flap in your 
heart forming an abnormal connection between the right and left 
sides of your heart (a patent foramen ovale).  This kind of flap 
is found in over 10% of people.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
-STARTED Aspirin
-STARTED Clopidogrel
-STARTED Metoprolol
-STARTED Atorvastatin
-STARTED Oxycodone and Colchicine for pain
-STOPPED your home benzapril
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has a history of prostate cancer, treated with radiation therapy, and no other significant past medical history. He is allergic to Gadolinium-containing agents. 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. An attempt was made to open the lesion, but it was not successful, and the patient was treated medically to avoid a potential procedural complication. 

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and he was prescribed medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. His physical examination was normal, with no signs of cardiac failure or respiratory distress. 

Laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage, but his kidney and liver function tests were normal. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, V4-6, consistent with a STEMI. 

The patient's chest X-ray and echocardiogram showed normal heart and lung structures, with no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.","

Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ with a history of MI (___), CHF (EF 55-60% ___, GI bleed 
s/p ileostomy c/b bowel obstructions, CKD who was transferred to 
___ from OSH for L sided pneumonia and pleural effusion, 
admitted to MICU for medical management of left pleural 
effusion, hypotension (low at baseline), ___ on CKD, and 
electrolyte derangement. 
 
# L Pleural Effusion - Etiology was considered in setting of 
pneumonia (leukocytosis with left shift, cough, though afebrile) 
vs. malignancy vs. CHF exacerbation. Pleural fluid studies were 
consistent with exudative effusion (elevated LDH, fluid/serum 
protein .46), making infectious etiology most likely. Patient 
initially received CTX/Azithro at OSH. Given GI symptoms in 
setting of slight hyponatremia, we sent Legionella antigen, 
which were negative. In the MICU we continued CTX and 
Azithromycin. CT chest showed loculated non hemorrhagic 
effusions. No evidence of occult malignancy. Pleural fluid was 
sent for cytology which was negative. 

# Shock - Patient was initially hypotensive to SBPs ___. 
Distributive is most likely in setting of pulmonary infection. 
Lactate was normal. Pressures become stable with SBPs ___ 
s/p Albumin 25g IV in the ED. Cardiogenic etiology is less 
likely given normal TTE in ___. We continued to treat infection 
as described above.   
 
# Congestive Heart Failure - EF 55-60% on TTE in ___. Patient 
has been taking Lasix 40mg PO TID at home. BNP 28329 (patient 
does have CKD, 797 in ___. She was volume overloaded on exam 
(marked JVD and acute onset ___. Possibly exacerbated in the 
setting of paroxysmal afib. Diuresis was held due to hypotension 
in the MICU; however, on the floor she was digressed with 40 mg 
IV lasix for a total of 9L net negative for LOS. Her lasix was 
switched to 30 mg of Torsemide on discharge for better 
absorption. 

#Pre renal ___: On admission Creatinine elevated to 2.5. On 
___ it was 1.03, though elevated to 3.3 in ___. Likely 
cardiorenal physiology in setting of CHF and RAS (BUN/Cr 30). 
C/b hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and ACD. She 
was diuresed and her Cr improved to normal with discharge of 
0.9. She did have persistently low bicarb that improved with 
supplementation. 

# Atrial fibrillation - CHA2DS2-VASc 5 - Patient managed on 
nadolol at home. She had been started on Eliquis ___, but 
discontinued due to GIB. Patient reports increased palpitations 
over the past several days, no dizziness/lightheadedness. 
Metoprolol tartrate 6.25 IV q6h was started in the ICU and her 
metoprolol was switched to PO and uptitrated for better rate 
control. Free T4 and T3 were WNL. She was discharged on 150 XL 
of metoprolol. 
  
#Severe Malnutrition - Pt weighs 99 lbs BMI 13. Based on her 
height, ideal weight is 160 lbs. Chronically underweight and no 
evidence of underlying psychiatric illness and felt to be ___ to 
ABD pain and hyperthyroidism She's had multiple bowel surgeries 
and malabsorption is possible and fecal fat studies are pending 
at time of discharge. Celiac's ruled out. Vitamin D 27 and she 
was started on 1/weekly supplementation w/50k. B12/Folate WNL. 
She should continue with Carnation or Ensure shakes TID. 

 # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis - Pure AG metabolic acidosis 
most likely due to uremia. Another possible cause was increased 
acetaminophen ingestion in setting of pain (oxoproline). She was 
not compensating appropriately (pCO2 should be ___, likely 
___ hypoventilation in setting of marked effusion and breathing 
limited by pain (thus also some component of respiratory 
acidosis). Patient received bicarbonate in the ED. Acidosis 
began to improve with improvement in her shock state.  

 # Hyperkalemia - Likely in setting of CKD, exacerbated by 
acidosis. Patient was given Insulin/Dextrose and Calcium 
Gluconate in ED for K of 5.9. Patient received an EKG without 
peaked T waves. Her potassium began to trend toward normal.   

 # Hyperphosphatemia - Chronic issue in setting of CKD, patient 
also has hypocalcemia.  

 # Hypocalcemia - Corrected Ca 7.6. Secondary PTH likely given 
CKD. In setting of hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia and worsening renal 
function. 
 
 # Hyperthyroidism - Patient reportedly had thyroid US within 
last 6mo. R>L thyroid enlargement, which she says has been 
increasing since US.  Patient was continued on her home 
methimazole of 20 mg. 
 
 # Anemia - Patient has known CKD. There may be some component 
of nutritional deficiency, poor PO intake, s/p ileostomy. 
Patient did not require transfusion in the unit or on the 
medicine floor.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came to us with shortness of breath and we found that you 
likely had a pneumonia and a loculated pleural effusion. Our 
Thoracic surgeons drained the fluid and added a chest tube which 
drained the remaining fluid. A repeat CT shows no pneumonia or 
signs of malignancy. We had endocrine see you who recommended 
seeing an ophthalmologist for your hyperthyroidism. We removed 
nearly 8 liters of fluid from you for a heart failure 
exacerbation. We are changing your Lasix to Toresemide which is 
better absorbed. We are discharging you on 30 mg daily. Please 
follow up with your cardiologist for labs and adjustment of the 
dose. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you the best!
Your ___ Team.  
 
Followup Instructions:
