IMAGING:
==========
Chest PA/lat ___
1. No pneumonia.
2. Opacity in the left lower lung base is likely due to nipple 
shadow,
however, a focal mass cannot be excluded.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Although likely due to nipple shadows, 
re-imaging with conventional chest radiographs are recommended 
for further evaluation of left lower lung opacity.

Paracentesis ___
Technically successful ultrasound-guided therapeutic 
paracentesis, with
removal of 5 L of straw-colored fluid.

Chest Portable ___
nterval extubation.  Decreased lung volumes with patchy 
bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Crowding of 
the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large 
effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal 
contours are likely stable given differences in patient 
positioning and inspiratory effort.

RUQ US ___:
1.  The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.  
2. The liver has a cirrhotic morphology.  No focal lesions seen. 
 
3.  Large volume ascites. 

CXR ___:
___ to ___.  Increasing retrocardiac opacity, 
suggestive of 
pneumonia or aspiration.  Stable right basal atelectasis.  
Moderate 
cardiomegaly persists.  In the interval, the patient has been 
intubated the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 
approximately 6 cm above the carinal. 

CXR ___:
No acute intrathoracic abnormality. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ EtOH cirrhosis MELD 17 complicated by resistant ascites 
requiring q2wk para, 3 cords of grade I varices ___ who is 
actively drinking presented to the ED with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, s/p endoscopy and banding and management of 
abdominal pain.

#Abdominal Pain: likely from ascites on admission, with 
diagnostic paracentesis completed showing no signs of SBP, 
followed by ___ guided therapeutic paracentesis. Abdominal pain 
controlled initially with oxycodone as needed, and then 
transitioned to tramadol. Her hospital course was then notable 
for a rising bilirubin.
Infectious workup was repeated with blood culture, CXR, and 
peritoneal culture which were all unrevealing. She was 
discharged to complete an antibiotic course for SBP prophylaxis 
in the setting of her variceal bleed as well as for her 
enterococcal UTI. She is discharged with instructions for blood 
work within 1 week  and a follow up with her primary 
hepatologist.

# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive at baseline 90/50's. On 
presentation to ED 80/40's; likely from acute blood loss in 
setting of hematemesis and possible GI bleed versus 
decompensated cirrhosis; patient also has ascites on exam 
concerning for an SBP.  Peritoneal fluid w/ 32 WBCs. Patient was 
transfused 4u on ___ and 1u ___ and maintained on levophed 
initially.  Prior to transfer to medicine floor, she was started 
on 10mg TID midodrine. 

# Upper GI Bleed: patient presented with 6 episodes of 
hematemesis, tarry stools, with a history of 
varices/gastropathy/GAVE. Differential diagnosis includes PUD 
vs. variceal bleeding vs. bleeding from GAVE.  Patient was 
started on SBP prophylaxis with ceftriaxone and started on 
octreotide and PPI gtts. On ___, on admission to ICU, EGD was 
performed; banded 2 grade II/III varices during ICU admission. 
She was treated with Octeride gtt, PPI gtt, SBP with 
ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone was continued for 7 day course. Repeat 
blood counts remained stable and she was asymptomatic with 
orthostatic testing. As her hospital course stabilized, she was 
resumed on furosemide and spironolactone. 

# Urinary Enterococcus: Asymptomatic though in setting of 
hypotension concerning for infection. Patient received empiric 
IV vancomycin (___-), which was continued for a 7 day course 
for complicated UTI (last day ___. 
 
# Cirrhosis: MELD 17 ___ C. ___ be decompensated now 
given worsening BPs. Complicated by ascites, varices, 
encepholpathy, abdominal pain. No history of SBP. On 
lactulose/rifaxmin at home although unclear compliance. Diarrhea 
at baseline. Recent cold, no reversal of sleep/wake. Not 
encepholopathic. Actively drinking; therefore not a transplant 
candidate. Patient was continued on lactulose, rifaximin.  
Patient underwent thepareutic paracentesis in the ICU with 
removal of 3L. The Lasix/sprinolactone in the setting of her 
recent active GI bleeding and hypotension, resumed later on the 
hospital course, along with lactuose and rifaximin.

# Coagulopathy: INR 1.4. Plt 77. Around baseling. Likely 
secondary to liver disease and poor nutrition. 

# Alcohol abuse: About a bottle of wine daily. Last drink day 
prior to admission. Tachycardic and tremulous on exam.  Patient 
was placed on CIWA scale, treatment dose IV thiamine was 
initiated along with IV folate and multivitamin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
-Patient to complete SBP ppx course on ___
-Patient to complete enterococcal UTI course on ___
-Patient discharged on tramadol for her chronic abdominal pain, 
repeated paracentesis did not reveal evidence of SBP
- Patient discharged on sucralfate until she is seen in clinic 
follow up
- Patient ordered for CBC, Chem, LFTs to be collected on 
___ and faxed to the liver transplant clinic
- On CXR, noted left lower lung opacity. Although likely due to 
nipple shadows, re-imaging with conventional chest radiographs 
are recommended for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
On evening of admission, prior fem-fem cutdown site was probed 
by Fellow, who was easily able to palpate the graft. The 
following day, a wound vac was placed on this site. Pt's ray 
incision was packed with iodoform. A LLE ultrasound was obtained 
to evaluate pt's asymmetrical edema and was negative for DVT.   
Pt was seen by her outpt Cardiologist, who recommended a family 
meeting and palliative care consult should pt require a major 
operation. 
On HD 4, a CTA was obtained and demonstrated decreased fluid 
around the graft and an open bypass graft with flow to the foot. 
That night, she tripped on her vac and began to complain of L 
leg pain. 
The following day, pt continued to complain of L leg pain as 
well as SOB. She spiked another fever. Bcx was again sent and a 
CXR demonstrated diffuse interstital edema and small pleural 
effusions. The next day, pt's SOB resolved but her L leg pain 
persisted. Another LLE US found no DVT and a knee x-ray did not 
demonstrate any acute findings. During a vac change, fluid was 
sent and grew E.coli. 
The next day, HD 7, pt's leg pain persisted. Pain meds were 
increased. X-rays from the pelvis down were obtained; they 
showed osteopenia but no fractures or dislocations. A blister 
was noted of the dorsum of her left foot and her antibiotics 
were changed to vancomycin and zosyn (from vanc/cipro/flagyl) to 
better cover streptococcus. The following day the pt's leg pain 
was somewhat improved but the blister on her foot had enlarged. 
A CT scan was obtained and showed edema but no air or abscesses. 

On HD 9, pt's LUE AV graft was unable to be accessed at HD. The 
following day, Interventional Radiology performed a successful 
thrombectomy and venoplasty. On HD 10, a foot XRay was taken, 
which demonstrate a non-displaced ___ metatarsal fracture. 
Podiatry was consulted and recommended no intervention and 
heel-touch only weight bearing status in the left side. The do 
not believe the left foot blister and residual wound is related. 
On HD ___, antibiotic coverage was adjusted to allow for dosing 
only with dialysis, for ease of administration outside the 
hospital. On HD ___ arrangements were made for the patient to be 
discharged to rehab. At the time of discharge, her pain was 
controlled, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding and 
moving her bowels spontaneously. She was sitting up in a chair 
for the large part of the day, but was not yet moving around on 
her own. She should continue physical therapy in rehab to work 
on regaining her mobility.

27,"||startoftext||The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted with a chief complaint of left thigh bleeding. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, COPD, and prior DVT. She was previously treated with Lovenox and was admitted to the hospital with an arterial bleed into her thigh, which required embolization of the left medial femoral circumflex artery. The patient's bleeding resolved with the application of Surgicel and direct pressure, but she experienced recurrent bleeding when she got up to use the bathroom. A CT scan revealed a fluid collection with surrounding stranding, consistent with an abscess. The patient was treated with antibiotics and was advised to remain non-weightbearing. She was also prescribed medications including acetaminophen, furosemide, levothyroxine, and valacyclovir.

The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, hypothyroidism, COPD, and prior DVT. She also has a history of breast cancer, asthma, and ocular herpes. Her social history is significant for a motor vehicle accident in which she believes part of her skull was removed.

The patient's physical examination revealed a firm hematoma in her left upper thigh, as well as a chronic appearing wound with no active bleeding. Her vital signs were stable, and her laboratory results showed a decrease in her hemoglobin level. The patient was advised to remain non-weightbearing and to follow up with her primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment. ||endoftext||","age: 75. gender: F.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

WHY DID I COME TO THE HOSPITAL?
===========================
-You were admitted because you had bleeding from your left 
thigh.

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS ADMITTED?
================================
-While you were admitted, our Vascular Surgeons operated on your 
left thigh and drained the collection there. 
-We gave you IV antibiotics and switched you to oral 
antibiotics.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
=======================================
-Continue to take all of your medications and keep all of your 
appointments as listed below. 
-Importantly, continue taking your antibiotic (Bactrim for your 
left thigh infection). You will need to take this twice a day 
(one in morning, one in evening). 
-Stop taking your atenolol and lisinopril for now. We stopped 
this because your blood pressures were on the lower side. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team 

 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output: The patient has chronic wounds on their legs and is experiencing frequent recurrences of bleeding episodes. They are currently being treated with antibiotics such as acetylclovasil and bactirum, along with supportive measures including bedrest and compression therapy. The patient is prescribed levoxetin and fluvaxacin, and should follow-up regularly with his doctor to monitor progress.

Input: The input includes information about the patient’s medical history, current symptoms, test results, diagnosis, treatments, allergies, and social history. It also contains detailed physical examination findings, lab reports, and imaging scans. Finally, the output provides comprehensive summary of the patient’s condition and treatment options.

Conclusion: Based on the provided clinical data and analysis, the physician concluded that the patient might experience persistent bleeding issues resulting from previous surgeries and complications. He recommended immediate admission and ongoing monitoring, followed by appropriate therapeutic interventions tailored towards individual needs. Ultimately, the goal of this case study is to provide valuable insights and guidance to healthcare professionals working with patients suffering from similar conditions. By providing proper diagnoses, therapies, and recommendations based on specific factors like age, gender, and personal health history, physicians can help optimize outcomes for patients undergoing medical procedures or seeking advice regarding their overall well-being."

area (on Humira since ___, hidradenitis suppuritiva L groin 
& R axilla, cognitive defect, transferred to ___ from ___ 
___ found to have NSTEMI on hep gtt with troponin 0.3 
downtrending to.22 with outside EKG <1mm lateral ST 
depressions, on CTA found to have 2.7cm upper left lobe nodule 
with significant hilar lymphadenopathy. Upon admission, patient 
was placed on a heparin drip and received PRN nitroglycerin for 
control of chest pain. Patient was taken to the cath lab on 
___ that showed 60% stenosis of his RCA and 30% stenosis of 
LCx. No intervention was performed. He was started on ASA, 
statin a beta-blocker for his CAD. Patient continued to complain 
of chest pain, but given the cath results this was thought to be 
unlikely caused by cardiac disease. He had an incidental finding 
of a RUL lung nodule and significant hilar lymphadenopathy. 
Patient reported recent night sweats with unintentional 30-lb 
weight loss. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with hilar lymph node biopsy as an 
outpatient. Additionally, the patient had on-going rectal pain 
due to his ___ wound. Dermatology and colorectal surgery 
were consulted and recommended wound care. Biopsies and further 
work up were deferred for the outpatient setting. Patient also 
developed loose stools with incontinence concerning for C diff 
given history. He was started and discharged with a prescription 
for PO vancomycin. 

  
 # CORONARIES: unknown
 # PUMP: unknown 
 # RHYTHM: sinus    

# NSTEMI: Patient presented with three days of chest pain, peak 
trop 0.3, EKG with <1mm STD in lateral leads. Patient EKG did 
show evidence of old inferolateral infarct. Patient was started 
on a heparin drip for NSTEMI. Chest pain required nitroglycerin 
and intermittently oxycodone/IV morphine for relief. Patient 
underwent coronary catheterization on ___ which revealed 
RCA 60% stenosis and LCx 30% stenosis. No intervention was 
performed. Patient began ASA, Atorvastatin, metoprolol for CAD 
medical management. Following cath, patient continued to have 
chest pain that was largely unchanged. Multiple EKGs pre and 
post cath did not show new changes or signs of ischemia. While 
the patient had documented CAD on cath, it is possible that some 
of his chest pain was also due to demand ischemia given give 
___ wounds. Pain ___ also be due to hilar 
lymphadenopathy found on CTA. Interventional pulmonology was 
consulted, please see explanation below for lung nodule/hilar 
lymphadenopathy.

# Pulmonary nodule: CT chest reveals discrete nodule  in LUL 
that is >2.0cm in diameter.  OSH started CTX and Doxy for CAP on 
___ but this was discontinued on ___ given no suspicion for 
PNA. Patient with reported history 30 pound weight loss, night 
sweats for ___ months. CTA was uploaded to ___ system for 
image review. Per wet read of radiology, most concerning on the 
CTA was significant hilar lymphadenopathy. History is concerning 
for possible lymphoma vs other malignancy vs infectious 
etiology. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who 
recommended bronchoscopy with biopsy as an outpatient. Patient 
is scheduled for bronchoscopy on ___. 

# Hydradinitis Suppurative Lesions: Patient with lesions in  
axilla, groin, and perianal area are consistent with the 
distribution seen in hidradinitis suppurativa. He has started to 
see improvement in his right axillary lesion but his perianal 
lesions are unchanged.  Dermatology was consulted for re-biopsy 
of anal wound given concern given differing pathology reports 
and unclear diagnosis given refractory nature of his perianal 
lesion. There was no evidence of infection on exam. Colorectal 
surgery was also consulted who discussed patient case with derm. 
___ wounds are painful and of unclear etiology. DDx 
includes verrucous carcinoma vs pyoderma gangrenosum. Since 
patient had multiple previous biopsies by his outpatient 
dermatologist, the decision was made to defer further biopsies 
and discuss with his primary dermatologist as an outpatient. 
Patient was discharged home with wound care ___ services. Humira 
was restarted on discharge, held in-house. 
 
# Coagulopathy: INR elevated on admission to 1.6.  Liver 
synthetic function wnl.  INR remined stable but elevated 
throughout admission. 

# DMII: On metformin at home. Held metformin in the setting of 
potential cath. Last HbA1C 7.2% ___. Patient was given 
Humalog sliding scale while inpatient and discharged to continue 
home dose of metformin on discharge. 

****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES****
[ ] Follow up C diff studies. Discontinue PO vanc if negative. 
If patient, patient should complete 2 week course
[ ] Incidental nodule and hilar LAD on CT requiring 
bronchoscopy/biopsy. Ensure patient follows up with 
interventional pulmonology. Procedure is scheduled for ___ 
[ ] Did not require cath and chest pain is unlikely cardiac, but 
cath did show CAD; therefore, the patient was started on 
atorvastatin 80mg daily, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 BID and 
aspirin 81mg 
[ ] Patient reported attempting to self-taper his alprazolam. He 
was advised to do this under the guidance of a physician. Please 
follow up his benzo use and desire to taper.
[ ] Please ensure close follow up with outpatient dermatology. 
He has had no improvement on Humira thus far and there is strong 
suspicion that this ___ not be PG. Verrucous carcinoma is a 
likely alternative diagnosis. Colorectal surgery recommended 
repeat biopsy, but ___ derm elected to defer repeat biopsy to 
his outpatient provider.

25,"||startoftext||The patient is a 58-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. She had a history of recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer and had undergone multiple surgeries and chemotherapy treatments. She was initially diagnosed with stage IIC ovarian cancer and had received carboplatin and Taxol therapy until she developed a carboplatin allergy. She was then switched to Doxil and later started on Arimidex. She had been stable until she developed abdominal pain, concern for acute appendicitis, and underwent laparoscopic evaluation, which revealed several carcinoma implants along both hemidiaphragms, the right lobe of the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and appendix.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy and end ileostomy. She was found to have small bowel pneumatosis and was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for sepsis. She was also found to have rising CA-125 levels and was initiated on carboplatin therapy. However, she developed a carboplatin allergy and was switched to Doxil.

The patient's past medical history is significant for recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer, osteopenia, and a family history of CAD and ovarian cancer. Her physical exam revealed abdominal tenderness, absent bowel sounds, and a Foley catheter in place draining clear urine.

The patient's discharge medications included vanc/zosyn, and her discharge labs showed elevated WBC count, AST, and ALT levels. Her imaging studies revealed a partially rim-enhancing fluid collection within the anterior midline abdomen, no findings of bowel obstruction or leak, and bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.

In summary, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer who underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomy and end ileostomy due to abdominal pain and concern for acute appendicitis. She was found to have small bowel pneumatosis and was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for sepsis. She was also found to have rising CA-125 levels and was initiated on carboplatin therapy, but developed a carboplatin allergy and was switched to Doxil. ||endoftext||","age: 58. gender: F.

IMAGING:
-___ KUB: 1. No overt radiologic evidence of small-bowel 
obstruction or ileus 2. Nasoenteric tube with the tip likely 
projecting over the region consistent with body of the stomach. 

-___ CXR:1. New moderately large left and small right pleural 
effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis. 2. Satisfactory 
position of peripherally inserted central venous catheter.  

-___ Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis in bilateral 
kidneys.

-___ CXR: Increased density at the left base consistent with 
parenchymal 
consolidation. Bilateral pleural effusions may obscure the 
underlying 
pulmonary opacities. There is no definite change. 

-___ CT ABD &Pelvis: 1. Partially rim-enhancing fluid 
collection within the anterior midline abdomen in close 
proximity to the transverse colon surgical chain sutures. 
Underlying superinfection cannot be excluded and the collection 
is amenable to needle aspiration if needed.  2. No findings of 
bowel obstruction or leak. Persistent but slightly improved 
edematous appearance of the remaining large bowel when compared 
to the outside ___ exam. 3. Nonspecific enhancement 
and fluid in the right paracolic gutter. While this may 
represent post-procedural change, underlying peritoneal disease 
is also possible in this patient with known metastatic disease. 
4. Renal cysts including a hyperdense cyst off the left lower 
pole. 5. Bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion. 


-___ CXR: In comparison with study of ___, the right base 
shows substantial clearing with moderate atelectatic streaking 
and probable small effusion. On the left, however, there is 
still extensive opacification consistent with pleural effusion, 
atelectasis, and possibly supervening pneumonia in the 
appropriate clinical setting. 

-___ CT abd: 1. Slight interval decrease in size to partially 
organized intra-abdominal fluid collection within the midline 
abdomen which is of higher density today and may suggest 
decreasing phlegmon or evolving hematoma. A small amount of air 
within this collection is likely related to recent attempted 
aspiration. No new fluid collections or extraluminal oral 
contrast is present. 2. Persistent edema and wall thickening 
involving the visualized large bowel, most pronounced in the 
region of the splenic flexure. Slight interval worsening of 
small bowel wall thickening and mesenteric induration in the 
left upper quadrant. This may reflect postoperative change, 
serositis, and/or tumor infiltration. No bowel obstruction. 3. 
Interval increase in moderate-size simple left pleural effusion 
resulting in complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe. 4. 
Fatty liver. 

-___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, left PICC line 
is in 
unchanged position. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has 
almost 
completely resolved. The pre-existing left pleural effusion 
shows a slightly different distribution but is overall unchanged 
in extent. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac 
atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. 

-___ CT chest: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. Moderate left and 
trace right pleural effusions with overlying pulmonary 
atelectasis. 3. Bilateral prominent hilar lymph nodes as well as 
numerous, though not frankly enlarged upper mediastinal and 
supraclavicular lymph nodes. Close attention to these areas is 
recommended given the history of known malignancy. 

-___ CT abd: Limited study without intravenous or enteric 
contrast 
demonstrating post-operative changes with no definable 
intra-abdominal fluid collection for drainage. 

-___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of 
the 
pre-existing left pleural effusion is unchanged. A minimal right 
pleural 
effusion is newly visualized. Moderate bilateral basal 
atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. 
Unchanged course of the left PICC line. No pulmonary edema. No 
focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia 

-___ CT chest:1. Despite evidence of aspiration, attributable to 
the over distended esophagus, the large areas of consolidation 
at the lung bases, by virtue of their persistence and relative 
homogeneity, are indistinguishable as either atelectasis alone 
or atelectasis and pneumonia. There is no pneumonia in the upper 
or middle lobes. Persistent bilateral pleural effusion, moderate 
on the left and small on the right. 

-___ CT chest, abd and pelvis: 1. No evidence of PE. Mild 
pulmonary edema and increased bilateral pleural effusions. 
Bilateral lower lobe bronchial mucoid impaction and atelectasis; 
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  2. Small bowel 
ileus, with patent ileostomy.  3. Intact ___ pouch, with 
apparent mild wall thickening. Please correlate for inflammatory 
or infectious colitis. 4. Mild ascites, partially loculated in 
anterior omentum. Irregular enhancement may represent 
inflammation or peritoneal metastasis. 5. Emphysema and 
pulmonary hypertension. 

-___ CXR: 1. Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe 
collapse and/or consolidation, similar or possibly slightly 
worse. 2. Interval resolution right effusion, but new plate-like 
right base atelectasis 
.
Tissue biospy pathology:
1.  Right colectomy (A-H):
A.  Focal perforation.
B.  Extensive acute and organizing serositis.
C.  Focal serosal carcinoma consistent with patient's known 
serous ovarian carcinoma.
2.  Terminal ileum, resection (J-L):
Acute and organizing serositis
.
Pleural fluid ___: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with metastatic papillary serous 
ovarian CA who was transferred from ___ with SBO. She had 
exp laparotomy on ___ where a perforated transverse colon was 
found; a R extended hemicolectomy and end ileostomy was 
performed, with L colon no longer in continuity with GI tract. 
This surgery was reported to be uneventful with minimal blood 
loss but some intra-peritoneal intra-peritoneal spillage. She 
was transferred to ICU for post-op monitoring given severity of 
comorbidities.
.
Given the concern for intraoperative spillage, she was started 
on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Fluconazole for planned five day course 
(day ___ this was broadened to Vancomycin, Meropenem, 
Ciprofloxacin and Fluconazole (day ___ when she was found to 
have developed a concomitant pneumonia. Her pain was treated 
with a Dilaudid PCA and she was kept NPO with TPN post-surgery. 
She was also continued on IV Bblocker and IV PPI post surgery.
.
The patient remained hypoxic after her surgery, with high 
supplemental oxygen need, thought to be due to splinting from 
abdominal pain as well as pneumonia; she was treated with 
antibiotics as above. She initially had acute renal failure with 
poor urine output but this improved with volume resuscitation. 
.
This patient has known metastatic ovarian cancer and was on 
weekly Avastin/Taxol prior to GI perforation. She was given one 
dose of neupagen on ___ after surgery; this was stopped after 
discussing with Gyn/Onc. Gyn/Onc will further direct her 
oncologic treatment, with social work and pastoral care 
following. 
.
Patient was transferred to the floor on ___ after oxygen 
requirement was tapered to 6L. Patient was diuresed with IV 
lasix and TPN was halved. She was advanced from clear liquids to 
regular diet over the following two days with TPN discontinued. 
Patient's ostomy showed normal outputs with appropriate gas. On 
___, the superior pole of the abdominal incision was noted 
to be erythematous with clear drainage. 3 staples were removed, 
cultures sent, and wound was packed. Gram stain showed no 
organisms. Wound was monitored and anitbiotics continued. Given 
the appearance of the wound and persistent elevated EBC count, 
CT abdomen was performed to assess for abdominal fluid 
collection which revealed a small anterior fluid collection in 
the superior abdomen. ___ was consulted but the collection was 
too small to drain. Follow up CT scans were performed to see 
progression of collection with gradual resolution noted on 
imaging. Over the next several days, superior abdominal wound 
opened further with fascial dehiscence noted in wound and 
drainage of purulent fluid. Wound was packed with aquacel and 
drainage decreased over time. 

As wound improved, persistent leukocytosis raised concern for 
cdiff colitis. Patient was started on empiric flagyl and a 
sigmoidoscopy was performed to assess remnant colon for 
pseudomembranes, with none seen. Flagyl was stopped once 3 cdiff 
cultures were negative. On ___, patient was complaining of 
significant muscle cramping, refractory to diazepam. One dose of 
tizanidine was given and patient was overly sedated. She was 
monitored closely with no change in respiratory function, though 
she was drowsy. Once tizanidine wore off, she was active with no 
mental slowing. Tizanidine was not given and diazepam was 
stopped.

On ___, patient reported severe dyspnea and tachycardia and a 
CTA chest was performed to rule out PE. Scan was negative and 
patient's dyspnea was releived with nebulizer treatments and 
supplemental oxygen. A similar episode occured on ___, and a 
repeat CTA chest was performed in light of patient's high risk 
due to cancer, and immbolization. Repeat scan was also negative. 
On ___, interventional pulmonology was consulted for 
therapeutic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in hopes of 
improving patient's dyspnea. 400 cc of seroud fluid was drained, 
with no bacterial growth, and chemistries consistent with 
transudate. Her dyspnea improved significantly after this, 
though she occasionally had episodes of dyspnea and tachycardia, 
presumably from anxiety.

Over the next ___ days, patient's leukocytosis stabilized around 
16 and her oxygen requirement resolved. She worked with physical 
therapy and po intake was encourage. 
Calorie count revealed inadequate calories intake. Her nutrition 
was supplemented with ensure shakes. 

At discharge, pt felt well. She was discharged on hospital 
day#28/post-operative day #26 in stable condition: afebrile, 
able to eat regular food, under adequate pain control with oral 
medications, and ambulating with ___ and urinating without 
difficulty.

Discharge Instructions:
___ were admitted to the hospital after emergency surgery for 
your colon perforation from your ovarian cancer. ___ have 
recovered from this procedure well and ___ are now ready to 
finish your recovery in rehab. 

___ have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed 
with staples. This incision can be left open to air or covered 
with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become 
irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until 
your first post-operative visit at which time they can be 
removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please 
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if ___ develop a 
fever. Please call the office if ___ develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.  ___ may 
shower and let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel; do not rub.

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___ may 
gradually increase your activity as tolerated but avoid heavy 
exercise. 

___ may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take 
more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while 
taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive 
a car while taking narcotic pain medication.

___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a 
new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the 
stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is 
very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large 
intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed 
into the body and the stool becomes formed. ___ must measure 
your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from 
the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If 
___ find that your output has become too much or too little, 
please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse 
practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the 
ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated. If ___ notice 
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink 
such as gatoraide. Please monitor yourself for signs and 
symptoms of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon 
standing), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If ___ 
notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the 
emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ 
may eat a modified regular diet with your new ileostomy.

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care 
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ stoma 
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be 
beefy red or pink. It may ooze small amounts of blood at times 
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around 
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the 
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed 
above. Please care for the ostomy as ___ have been instructed by 
the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ will be able to make an appointment 
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic after surgery. ___ will have 
nurses at rehab for the next few weeks helping to monitor your 
ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring for it on your own.

Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that ___ will have a quick return to your life and usual 
activities. Good luck!

Brief Hospital Course:
====================

Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with DM2, well controlled HLD, 
___ plaque and recent transient left field cut who was 
admitted for further work-up of this event. 

# NEUROLOGY:
He was admitted to the stroke service from ___ to ___ given 
concern that his transient left field cut was related to 
cardioembolic or proximal artery-to-artery embolus. Ultimately 
he was thought to have had a TIA. MRI was negative for stroke. 
TTE showed only preexisting VSD, however TEE showed complex, 
nonmobile atheroma in the aortic arch. Given risk for subsequent 
emboli, discussion was held with the patient, wife, and Dr. 
___ the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation 
vs dual antiplatelet therapy.  The patient chose dual 
antiplatelet therapy and was started on plavix and baby aspirin. 
 His stroke risk factors included hypertension, hyperlipidemia 
(although LDL- 54 well controlled on Crestor), diabetes (A1c 
9.3%).  His home rosuvasation and lantus were continued.  Given 
his recent visual field cut and our imprecise VF impatient 
testing, we advised Mr ___ not to drive until formal VF 
testing is done and there is confirmation that he can respond to 
all parts of his VFs to drive safetly.  A letter to his employer 
was generated, explaining this restriction. 

# ___: 
He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and was 
continued on his home meds: amlodipine, lasix, metoprolol, 
trandolapril, crestor. For his complex atheroma in the aortic 
arch, he was started on asa81 and plavix.

# ENDOCRINE:  
Poorly controlled diabetes, A1c 9.3%. He continued his lantus 
and glipizide.  We discussed the ___ of diet and 
exercise.

====================

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1) Needs formal VF testing prior to returning to driving.
2) Started on plavix & asa 81, but may need to consider systemic 
anticoagulation if further embolic phenomenon
3) Would benefit from ___ visits again in the future. 
4) PACT team is following

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to 
___.  You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left visual 
field cut resulting from a transient ischemic attack (a mini 
stroke), a condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen 
and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is 
the part of your body that controls and directs all the other 
parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived 
of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
1) high cholesterol including cholesterol in your aorta (large 
vessel leaving your heart
2) high blood pressure
3) diabetes mellitus

We are changing your medications as follows:
1) START Plavix 75mg daily
2) DECREASE your Aspirin dose to only 81mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Because of your visual problems last week, it is important for 
you to have a complete visual field test at your 
ophthalmologists office.  You CANNOT drive until you have this 
test completed and the results are approved by your 
ophthalmologist. 

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

## I've taken over the case notes after my previous doctor's resignation.


I'm writing up the medical records, including any relevant lab reports, imaging studies such as CT scans and MRIs, as well as information about past health issues like high blood pressure or diabetes.



Here's what happened during my visit:



When I first saw her, she introduced herself and then asked me how I felt today.


Then, I told her everything that led up to my problem -- specifically, I said that I'd gone out running two weeks earlier and hadn't realized something was wrong because I didn't notice anything unusual until suddenly hitting a car on my way back home.


She listened patiently and asked questions along the way, helping me understand more fully why these things happen.


Afterwards, she took measurements such as vital signs like pulse rate, temperature, etc., and conducted various physical examinations involving touching muscles, bones, joints, skin, eyesight, ears, throat, nose, feet, hands, arms...etc..

And finally, after discussing treatment options with me, she recommended certain medications based on my personal background--namely, lowering my blood pressure through medication called hydralazine and also reducing my triglycerides levels via prescription drugs named niacin and fenofibrate among others.. 


Nowadays, I rarely experience similar episodes anymore thanks to lifestyle modifications made under their guidance!


However, before prescribing specific treatments depending upon individual circumstances, they often ask patients whether there's nothing else they want them to try regarding nutrition plans or exercising schedules besides avoiding strenuous activities altogether...

They advise seeking advice from qualified professionals whenever necessary too! And although my own research indicates that undergoing regular checkups helps keep track of potential side effects associated with new medicines used alongside existing ones,..."
40,"||startoftext||The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has a history of prostate cancer, treated with radiation therapy, and no other significant past medical history. He is allergic to Gadolinium-containing agents. 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. An attempt was made to open the lesion, but it was not successful, and the patient was treated medically to avoid a potential procedural complication. 

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and he was prescribed medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. His physical examination was normal, with no signs of cardiac failure or respiratory distress. 

Laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage, but his kidney and liver function tests were normal. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, V4-6, consistent with a STEMI. 

The patient's chest X-ray and echocardiogram showed normal heart and lung structures, with no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure. ||endoftext||","age: 56. gender: M.

is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.   
A patent foramen ovale is present with right to left shunting of 
agitated saline contrast during Valsalva.  
.
___ Lower Extremity doppler ultrasound
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in right or left lower 
extremity.
.
___ Cardiac Catheterisation
Change for 6 ___ XB3 guide.  The initial plan was to pass the
wire as the primary reperfusion device.  A Pilot 50 Wire was
passed in a prolapsed fashion but this did not restore flow. 
Given that the patient was pain free and the small territory at
risk, it was decided to avoid further attempts at recanalization
(with balloon angioplasty) given risk of dissection, 
perforation.
The patient had intermittent chest pain at the end of the
procedure and was started on IV TNG and administered opiates 
with
resolution of chest pain.  He left the laboratory in stable
condition.
.
___ Foot XRay
Three views show the bony structures and joint spaces to be
essentially within normal limits. No dorsal swelling or evidence 
of erosion
is appreciated. No calcaneal spurs.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M w/ PMH of prostate CA, HTN, presenting with distal 
apical NSTEMI.
.
# APICAL LAD STEMI:  Distal LAD thrombosis with distal apical 
infarct, s/p unsuccessful recanalisation during cardiac 
catheterisation.  No other evidence of coronoary atherosclerosis 
was found. Echocardiogram whowed preserved EF and no ventricular 
wall motion abnormalities. However, he was noted to have a 
patent formane ovale.  Given absence of atherosclerotic disease, 
PFO and known CA prostate, thromboembolic event from a possible 
proximal DVT remains a possible etiology for his STEMI.  Cardiac 
enzymes peaked ___ and trended down prior to discharge. He 
was treated with a heparin drip for 2 days after the procedure, 
as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol.  He was started on 
lisinopril and atorvastatin, but these were held in the setting 
of acute kidney injury.  He will need to continue aspirin 
lifelong and clopidogrel for at least one year given his 
prothrombotic state.  Atorvastation was restarted at the time of 
discharge.
.  
# s/p CATH: unsuccessful attempt at wire recanalisation of 
distal LAD.
.
# THROMBOEMBOLISM: Cardiac cath shows no evidence of coronary 
atherosclerosis.  MI site is unusual and patient has PFO, 
history of prostate cancer, prothrombotic state. LENIs were 
negative, but did not include an evaluation of the iliac 
arteries.  He will continue aspirin and plavix for 
anticoagulation following discharge.  
.
# Fever: Etiology unclear. UA, CXR clear.  Urine cultures and 
blood cultures pending.  However, timing of fever suggests 
possible link with gout flare.  Other etiologies include: 
infection, post-MI, thromboembolism/PE, B-symptoms from cancer. 
His fever curve trended down spontaneously prior to discharge.
.
# Thigh pain - bilateral. Could be from strenous workout pt 
reports. CKs coming down but CK so out of proportion elevated 
compared to MB. We just started statin which can cause myopathy 
but states thigh pain since presentation. Pt without significant 
CAD that we know of.  We held his statin, but restarted it at 
the time of discharge.
.
# ___: Cr of 1.4 on ___ up from baseline of 1.0.  Could be 
secondary to high 
CK. Uric acid was 6.6, urinalysis was clear.  We gave him a 
small fluid bolus. 
.
# Right ankle pain - Most likely gout flair. pt with history of 
gout. A foot Xray was performed which showed no pathology.  His 
pain was controlled with percocet and colchicine.   
.  
# HTN: BP was high on presentation and he was initially on a 
nitro drip, but this was rapidly weaned and he was treated with 
metoprolol instead.  He was also started on lisinopril, but this 
was held given ___. He will need reevaluation
.
# Cardiac Risk factors: patient has hypertension.
Lipid panel was unremarkable.  HbA1C was pending at the time of 
discharge.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ACE inhibitor was held due to creatinine 
elevation.
Please reassess hypertension and creatinine as an outpatient and 
consider restarting an ACE inhibitor if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted with a heart 
attack. We performed a cardiac catheterization which showed a 
small blockage in the blood supply to the apex of your heart, 
but no other abnormalities in the blood flow to your heart.  We 
attempted to open this blockage, but were unable to do so and 
did not attempy further since the reduction of heart function 
was very small.  An echocardiogram was performed and this 
confirmed that your heart was beating normally.  The 
echocardiogram also showed that you have an open flap in your 
heart forming an abnormal connection between the right and left 
sides of your heart (a patent foramen ovale).  This kind of flap 
is found in over 10% of people.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
-STARTED Aspirin
-STARTED Clopidogrel
-STARTED Metoprolol
-STARTED Atorvastatin
-STARTED Oxycodone and Colchicine for pain
-STOPPED your home benzapril

Input file content:

##This case study describes Patient #1234 who presents with chronic inflammatory bowel disease and underwent laparoscopic resection with removal of diseased tissues from his lower abdominal area.

He first presented to the emergency room where he received initial evaluation and treatment before being discharged home.

His medical history includes previous surgeries such as umbilical herniotomies, adhesiolysis procedures, and colostomies performed by surgeons because of complications arising from severe inflammation in his gut tract.

He also suffered from recurrent attacks of diverticulosis due to prolonged periods of infection leading him towards seeking further intervention through endoscopies and other diagnostic tests like computed tomography scans (CT).

Furthermore, his family background revealed mild asthmatic issues back then but now seems noncontributing factors contributing toward this condition's onset.

Based upon these findings, we can conclude that Patient #1234 requires professional assistance especially since there hasn't been much improvement despite trying various treatments available today including conservative methods involving dietary adjustments alongside lifestyle changes like exercise routines designed specifically around reducing stress levels among others measures employed by physicians caring outpatients suffering similar conditions worldwide throughout their lives without incident!

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ and 
underwent a left ___ toe amputation. You have now recovered from 
surgery and are ready to be discharged. Please follow the 
instructions below to continue your recovery:

ACTIVITY: 
 On the side of your amputation (left) you are heel-weight 
bearing for ___ weeks. 
 You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever 
possible. 
 You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.
 No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.
 No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. 

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
 You may shower when you get home
 No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from 
your date of surgery 

WOUND CARE:
 Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If 
they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for 
staple removal. 
 When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place 
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will 
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these 
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm 
water and soap in the shower.

26,"||startoftext||The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital due to hypoxia after undergoing tumor debridement via rigid bronchoscopy. She has a history of renal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed in the past and has since metastasized to her lungs. She has undergone multiple chemotherapy regimens, including gemcitabine and sunitinib, and is currently taking these medications. 

The patient's past medical history includes osteoarthritis of her lower spine, asthma, cluster migraines, and left renal cell carcinoma. She has also had a history of migraines, which were treated with sumatriptan. 

During her hospital stay, the patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with cryotherapy and electrocautery to open her airways and improve her breathing. After the procedure, she developed shortness of breath and likely had a blockage of her airway from a mucous plug or blood clot. She was admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation and respiratory monitoring, and her breathing improved overnight. 

The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with metastases and post-procedure respiratory distress secondary to airway plugging. She was prescribed several medications, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide, levothyroxine, omeprazole, sunitinib, and Tylenol Extra Strength. She was also advised to follow up in clinic in one month with a CT scan of her airways. ||endoftext||","age: 54. gender: F.

regimens. Currently on gemcitibine/sunitinib. Next dose will be 
___.  
.  
Over the past two days has been having pink tinged sputum.  
Today, she had rigid bronchoscopy, with flex bronch. Did 
cryptherapy to left mainstem and bronchus intermedius tumors. 
Also did electrocautery and destruction with foreceps. Moderate 
bleeding controlled with electrocautery. Left mainstem 
completely open. On right side, endobronchial tumor was diffuse, 
could not be opened 100%. Subsequently developed tachypnea. 
Post-procedure, x-ray showed complete collapse of RML/RLL. 
Likely plugged bronchus intermedius with blood clot afterward. 
Now on bipap, with clinical improvement. Plan is to get x-ray on 
bipap to see how it looks. Getting decadron 4 mg Q8H due to 
possibility of airway edema in bronchus intermedius.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. You had a rigid 
bronchoscopy (procedure to look in your lungs) with cryptherapy 
and electrocautery to help open your airways and improve your 
breathing. After the procedure you had shortness of breath and 
likely had a blockage of your airway from a mucous plug or blood 
clot. You were admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation 
(breathing mask) and respiratory monitoring. Your breathing 
improved tremendously overnight and your x-ray showed 
improvement. You also received steroids after the procedure, 
which were subsequently stopped. 

The Interventional Pulmonology team was very involved in your 
care, and felt that your breathing was greatly improved and you 
were safe for discharge, with follow-up in clinic in one month 
with a CT scan of your airways. 

We did not change any of your medications. 

Please follow-up at your appointments below.
 
Followup Instructions:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a PMHx of EtOH cirrhosis, 
diverticulosis, and hypertension p/w progressively worsening 
abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
# ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA: CT scan showed mild colonic edema, 
possibly from infectious colitis vs. portal colopathy. Patient 
did not have any bowel movements for the first 24 hours of 
admission, indicating that CT findings were likely due to portal 
colopathy. Although her stools were loose, she was also taking 
lactulose. Abdominal pain may have been precipitated by 
continued alcohol abuse. Diagnostic para revealed 1 PMN. She was 
initially treated with cipro/flagyl, but patient refused these 
medications, and they were discontinued due to low suspicion of 
infection. She will follow-up with gynecology for possible 
pelvic congestion syndrome, which was noted on CT.  

# CIRRHOSIS: Secondary to alcohol abuse. Complicated by portal 
hypertension and ascites with recent hospitalizations for 
decompensation. No history of SBP, varices, or hepatic 
encephalopathy. Patient continues to drink alcohol despite 
emphasis from outpatient providers to abstain and declined to 
see a social worker during this admission. LFTs are consistent 
with continued alcohol use.   

# ASCITES: CT Abd/Pelvis with moderate ascites. Diagnostic 
paracentesis was negative for SBP. She underwent an 
ultrasound-guided therapeutic para draining 1.25L fluid by ___ on 
___. Her home furosemide and spironolactone were continued.  

# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: No history of hepatic encephalopathy. 
Her home lactulose and rifaximin were continued.   

# ETOH ABUSE: History of withdrawal seizures. She was monitored 
on a CIWA during this admission and required doses of diazepam 
initially. She had no complicated withdrawal sx during this 
admission. Folate and thiamine were continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient was concerned about her reducible umbilical hernia. 
Although she remains very high risk for surgical repair, she 
plans to seek a second opinion as an outpatient. This can be 
addressed at liver clinic followup
- Stool cultures pending on discharge
- Continue to encourage alcohol cessation. Patient declined to 
see a social worker during this admission.
- If she continues to be symptomatic, consider colonoscopy as 
outpatient to evaluate area of colopathy vs. colitis
- F/u with Ob-Gyn to evaluate possibility of pelvic congestion 
syndrome as contributor to her abdominal pain
- Patient should have electrolytes and liver labs checked within 
1 week of discharge, sent to Dr. ___ in the ___, 
Phone: ___ Fax: ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for abdominal pain and diarrhea. We initially 
treated you with antibiotics, but these were stopped as we had a 
low suspicion for infection. We drew cultures, which did not 
grow anything while you were here, and checked your stool for 
infection. You tested negative for C. diff, a common infection 
that could cause diarrhea. You should follow-up with your 
gynecologist to address other potential causes of abdominal 
pain. You also underwent a paracentesis while you were here to 
remove some fluid from your belly. 

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ team
