He was previously on medications such as metformin and lisinopril, but had not seen a primary care physician in a long time. He also uses cannabis regularly. 

The patient's symptoms included nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which improved with vomiting. He also reported constipation, but his last bowel movement was the morning of admission. 

The patient's physical examination was notable for acute distress and upper abdominal tenderness to palpation with hypoactive bowel sounds. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 7.5 with 84% polymorphonuclear cells, hemoglobin of 13.5, and platelet count of 107. 

The patient underwent an endoscopy (EGD) which showed mild erythema in the antrum and moderate erythema and congestion in the stomach body. Biopsies were taken. 

The patient's diagnosis was not acute intra-abdominal process, but rather diffuse anasarca, hepatic steatosis, and borderline enlarged spleen. 

At discharge, the patient was prescribed medications including Famotidine, Acetaminophen, and Haloperidol. ||endoftext||","||startoftext||The patient is a 24-year-old male with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prior use of metformin and lisinopril.

Discharge Instructions:
Instructions: Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure to be a part of your ___ team at ___ 
___.

====================================
Why did you come to the hospital? 
====================================

-You had abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting

====================================
What happened at the hospital? 
====================================

-You underwent upper endoscopy (EGD) test to look at the stomach 
area inside. The area looked normal. Biopsies were taken to look 
at tissue samples under a microscope. The results will take days 
to come back. Your new GI doctor ___ inform you of the results.
-The abdominal pain explanation is still unclear at time of 
discharge. The biopsy results are key to understanding if you 
may have a recurrent H pylori infection or not, as the possible 
cause of your pain.

==================================================
What needs to happen when you leave the hospital? 
==================================================

-For the abdominal pain: You will trial an acid reducing pill 
(pantoprazole) for 6 weeks as prescribed. Eat small regular 
meals and take anti-nausea meds as needed.

-Please set up a follow up appointment with your PCP and GI 
doctor as instructed. 

-You must see your PCP to have ___ referral to a kidney specialist 
(nephrologist) because of your high blood pressure at such a 
young age and that can be damaging your kidneys slowly over 
time.

-You must see your PCP to have ___ referral to a cardiologist, as 
there was evidence of heart disease based on bloodwork and the 
CT scan you had. This is absolutely important for you to get 
this investigated further in the office.

-For your diabetes: You need to take metformin to keep your 
blood sugars controlled

It was a pleasure taking ___ of you during your stay! 

Sincerely, 

Your ___ team

He presents with nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain that has worsened over several months. On examination, he appears alert and cooperates well. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5, hemoglobin of 14.6, and normal liver function tests and lipase levels. A gastroenterological endoscopy (EGD) revealed mild inflammation in the antrum and moderate erythema and congestion in the stomach-body region. The patient denies weight loss, fever, chills, and having experienced diarhea or bleeding stools. Instead, he experiences occasional mild headache.

She required aggressive volume resuscitation and pressor support to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90. Her ostomy output was bloody, and she reported not feeling well and having fevers and chills.

The patient underwent several surgeries, including an extended right colectomy, cholecystectomy, and ileostomy. She also had a right hepatic laceration treated with argon beam coagulation and packing. She was found to have extensive circumferential bowel wall thickening on CT scan, which was highly concerning for ischemic bowel.

The patient's diagnosis was ischemic bowel, and she was also diagnosed with sepsis. She was treated with antibiotics and pressor support, and her white count normalized. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with a tracheostomy, gastrostomy, and ileostomy, and was instructed to follow up with her doctor and to resume her regular medications.

The patient's medications at discharge included insulin, miconazole, lansoprazole, pregabalin, escitalopram, levothyroxine, metoprolol, and heparin.

Pertinent Results:
CT/CTA Head ___. Large left frontal intraxial mass with surrounding edema in 
close 
proximity of anterior carotid arteries and deep cerebral veins; 
however no 
definite evidence of invasion. Both ACA are displaced to the 
right. 
2. Mass effect on bilateral frontal horns of lateral ventricles, 
subfalcine 
herniation, and 10-mm rightward shift of midline structures from 
mass effect. 

CT head ___. Patient is newly status post superior left frontal craniotomy 
and 
resection of previously seen large left frontal lobe mass, with 
expected 
postoperative changes as delineated above. No large intracranial 
hemorrhage 
seen. Thin rim of hyperdense material seen in the resection bed, 
probably 
represent small amount of blood product and post-surgical 
debris. This thin 
rim is contiguous with more rounded hyperdense area which

rightward mass effect and resolved effacement of frontal horns 
after resection 
of previously seen large left frontal mass. 

MRI ___. done. read ___

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
WOUND CARE:
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and 
report any of the following problems to your physician. 
Keep your incision clean and dry.
You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo 24 hours after your 
sutures are removed.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your 
incision.   
DO NOT DRIVE until you are seen at the first follow up 
appointment.
Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your 
physician.

DIET
Usually no special diet is prescribed after a craniotomy. A 
normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you 
should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating 
before your surgery.  Be sure however, to remain well hydrated, 
and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may 
cause constipation. 

MEDICATIONS:
Take all of your medications as ordered.  You do not have to 
take pain medication unless it is needed.  It is important that 
you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough 
to walk.   
Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication. 
Medications that may be prescribed include: 
oNarcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone).  
oAn over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or 
Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as 
Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or 
Fleets enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and 
anesthesia can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for 
anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with 
laboratory blood drawing in one week.  This can be drawn at your 
PCPs office, but please have the results faxed to ___. 
If you have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will 
not require blood work monitoring.
If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or 
Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin, prior to your surgery, you 
should not resume taking this until cleared by your doctor.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and 
Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding. 
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure 
you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, 
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach 
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with 
meals, or a glass of milk. 

ACTIVITY:
The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired 
or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger

activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and 
begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
DO NOT DRIVE until you speak with your physician.
Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your 
physician.
