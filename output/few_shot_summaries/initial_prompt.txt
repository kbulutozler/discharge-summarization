cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20% and NYHA class III CHF (s/p ICD 
placement), DM, HLD, HTN, A.fib (on Coumadin), PVD (chronic 
lower extremity ulcers) who presented with chest pain.

The patient was at ___ and at 02:10 AM was noted to

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ y/o M with extensive vascular history who 
presented with chest pain and anemia. Transferred to MICU due to 
concern of demand ischemia in setting of LGIB.  

#Chest Pain - The patient has an extensive coronary history. His 
present episode of chest pain ocurred in the setting of 
tachycardia to the 160s (reported by EMS) and a hematocrit below 
his baseline. Given pt's EKG and clinical picture, the elevated 
troponin was most likely demand ischemia. He was given packed 
RBCs to increase oxygen supply for increased demand.   A CHF 
exacerbation despite an elevated BNP, but unclear likely given 
clear lungs and no fluid overload on CXR.  Other etiologies 
including PE was considered but his INR was supratherepeutic and 
pt was not hypoxic. Cardiology was consulted and did not believe 
that this was ACS and did not recommend coronary angiography.

# Anemia - The patient has a long history of anemia and has 
known history of gastric erosions, but no ulcers, and 
diverticuli. CT Abdomen this month has no evidence of 
malignancy. Pt is presently on iron supplementation. Guaiac (+) 
stool in ED and on the floor. Pt was transfused several units of 
RBCs (followed by lasix) to maintain a goal of hct>30 for demand 
ischemia. 
 
# A. Fib - CHADS2 score of 4. The patient presented in afib with 
a rate in the 110s, and hemodynamically stable. Pt may have had 
an episode of NSVT with EMS before arriving to ED since he had 
SVT during last admission. No SVT episodes during ICU course. Pt 
was continued on metoprolol with rates maintained below 100, 
until the patient developed the GI bleed.  Metoprolol was held 
given blood pressures in 90/50 and his heart rate was well 
controlled without it.  Given his GI bleed, his coumadin and 
metoprolol were held at the time of discharge.

#. C.diff colitis- The patient was found to have C. diff colitis 
and started on metronidazole on ___.  He will need to 
complete 14 days of metronidazole.
 
# PVD - Patient with PVD leading to ulcerations. Patient with 
stent placed recently and it was of high priority that he 
continued anti-platelet and AC with plavix and warfarin at 
present. With pt's GI bleed, vascular team was amenable to 
discontinuing Plavix. Wound care team followed pt throughout 
course.

# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease - Cr elevated to 2.0 on 
admission. Also with BUN elevation to suggest pre-renal state. 
___ also be due to renal vein congestion in the setting of CHF. 
After receiving blood products, his Cr improved and was 1.4 at 
the time of discharge.

# sCHF/CAD - Worsening EF thought to be due to progressive CAD. 
It was imperative to give blood/fluid slowly and diurese as 
needed. CXR and lungs presently clear with absent JVD on my 
exam. Pt's home torsemide was held.  The statin and ACE 
inhibitor were restarted by the time of discharge.  The patient 
should follow up with his cardiology within ___ weeks after 
discharge to assess the need to restart his torsemide.
 
# Delirium - Had difficulty with sundowning on prior admission. 
Seen by ___ consult and was started on zyprexa PRN agitation at 
night.

# DMII: Pt's home metformin was hekd and BG were monitored four 
times a day.  He was discharge on an Insulin sliding scale.

Transitional issues:
- Reassesment regarding restarting Coumadin, metoprolol and 
torsemide
- F/u with his PCP ___ 1 week of discharge from rehab
- F/u with his cardiology within ___ weeks of discharge from the 
hospital

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for 
chest pain.  We don't believe you had a heart attack, but the 
chest pain was likely related to lower oxygen to your heart.  
You are now chest pain free after receiving blood.  

We also found that you had a bleed within your gastrointestional 
system.  You underwent endoscopy, in otherword we looked with a 
camera at your gastrointestion system, which did not find the 
source of your bleeding.  We have stopped your plavix and 
currently stopping your coumadin after discharge.  We have also 
stopped your torsemide and metoprolol given lower blood 
pressure.  You should follow up with your cardiology and 
determine if you should restart the torsemide, metoprolol, and 
coumadin.  

We also found that you had an infection of your colon caused by 
a bacteria, clostridium difficle.  You will need to take 
antibiotics to treat this infection.

Finally, it is important that you rebuild your strength after 
discharge at the rehab extended care facility.

We are stopping your torsemide and metoprolol given your recent 
GI bleed.  Please talk with your cardiology about restarting 
metoprolol, torsemide and coumadin within ___ weeks of 
discharge.  Also, please see your primary care doctor within 1 
week of discharge from rehab.
 
Followup Instructions:

Output:
<END_REPORT>
<BEGIN_SUMMARY>
The patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with chest pain and anemia. He has a extensive past medical history, including coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. He was recently admitted with hypotension and was found to have a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction to 20%. He was also diagnosed with gastritis and duodenal ulcer.

The patient's diagnosis on admission was demand ischemia, and he was given packed red blood cells to increase oxygen supply. He was also treated for possible gastrointestinal bleeding and sepsis. His medications at discharge included warfarin, metoprolol, and iron supplementation.

The patient underwent an endoscopy and was found to have moderate gastritis and duodenal ulcer. He also had a positive stool test for Clostridium difficile.

The patient's physical examination on admission showed an irregularly irregular heartbeat, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and a II/VI systolic murmur. His lungs were clear to auscultation, and his abdomen was soft and non-tender. His extremities showed poor pulses bilaterally with eschar over an ulcer on the right.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, anemia, and abnormal liver function tests. His chest X-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.

The patient's hospital course was complicated by demand ischemia, anemia, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. He was treated with packed red blood cells, antibiotics, and iron supplementation. He was also continued on warfarin and metoprolol.

Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ with a history of MI (___), CHF (EF 55-60% ___, GI bleed 
s/p ileostomy c/b bowel obstructions, CKD who was transferred to 
___ from OSH for L sided pneumonia and pleural effusion, 
admitted to MICU for medical management of left pleural 
effusion, hypotension (low at baseline), ___ on CKD, and 
electrolyte derangement. 
 
# L Pleural Effusion - Etiology was considered in setting of 
pneumonia (leukocytosis with left shift, cough, though afebrile) 
vs. malignancy vs. CHF exacerbation. Pleural fluid studies were 
consistent with exudative effusion (elevated LDH, fluid/serum 
protein .46), making infectious etiology most likely. Patient 
initially received CTX/Azithro at OSH. Given GI symptoms in 
setting of slight hyponatremia, we sent Legionella antigen, 
which were negative. In the MICU we continued CTX and 
Azithromycin. CT chest showed loculated non hemorrhagic 
effusions. No evidence of occult malignancy. Pleural fluid was 
sent for cytology which was negative. 

# Shock - Patient was initially hypotensive to SBPs ___. 
Distributive is most likely in setting of pulmonary infection. 
Lactate was normal. Pressures become stable with SBPs ___ 
s/p Albumin 25g IV in the ED. Cardiogenic etiology is less 
likely given normal TTE in ___. We continued to treat infection 
as described above.   
 
# Congestive Heart Failure - EF 55-60% on TTE in ___. Patient 
has been taking Lasix 40mg PO TID at home. BNP 28329 (patient 
does have CKD, 797 in ___. She was volume overloaded on exam 
(marked JVD and acute onset ___. Possibly exacerbated in the 
setting of paroxysmal afib. Diuresis was held due to hypotension 
in the MICU; however, on the floor she was digressed with 40 mg 
IV lasix for a total of 9L net negative for LOS. Her lasix was 
switched to 30 mg of Torsemide on discharge for better 
absorption. 

#Pre renal ___: On admission Creatinine elevated to 2.5. On 
___ it was 1.03, though elevated to 3.3 in ___. Likely 
cardiorenal physiology in setting of CHF and RAS (BUN/Cr 30). 
C/b hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and ACD. She 
was diuresed and her Cr improved to normal with discharge of 
0.9. She did have persistently low bicarb that improved with 
supplementation. 

# Atrial fibrillation - CHA2DS2-VASc 5 - Patient managed on 
nadolol at home. She had been started on Eliquis ___, but 
discontinued due to GIB. Patient reports increased palpitations 
over the past several days, no dizziness/lightheadedness. 
Metoprolol tartrate 6.25 IV q6h was started in the ICU and her 
metoprolol was switched to PO and uptitrated for better rate 
control. Free T4 and T3 were WNL. She was discharged on 150 XL 
of metoprolol. 
  
#Severe Malnutrition - Pt weighs 99 lbs BMI 13. Based on her 
height, ideal weight is 160 lbs. Chronically underweight and no 
evidence of underlying psychiatric illness and felt to be ___ to 
ABD pain and hyperthyroidism She's had multiple bowel surgeries 
and malabsorption is possible and fecal fat studies are pending 
at time of discharge. Celiac's ruled out. Vitamin D 27 and she 
was started on 1/weekly supplementation w/50k. B12/Folate WNL. 
She should continue with Carnation or Ensure shakes TID. 

 # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis - Pure AG metabolic acidosis 
most likely due to uremia. Another possible cause was increased 
acetaminophen ingestion in setting of pain (oxoproline). She was 
not compensating appropriately (pCO2 should be ___, likely 
___ hypoventilation in setting of marked effusion and breathing 
limited by pain (thus also some component of respiratory 
acidosis). Patient received bicarbonate in the ED. Acidosis 
began to improve with improvement in her shock state.  

 # Hyperkalemia - Likely in setting of CKD, exacerbated by 
acidosis. Patient was given Insulin/Dextrose and Calcium 
Gluconate in ED for K of 5.9. Patient received an EKG without 
peaked T waves. Her potassium began to trend toward normal.   

 # Hyperphosphatemia - Chronic issue in setting of CKD, patient 
also has hypocalcemia.  

 # Hypocalcemia - Corrected Ca 7.6. Secondary PTH likely given 
CKD. In setting of hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia and worsening renal 
function. 
 
 # Hyperthyroidism - Patient reportedly had thyroid US within 
last 6mo. R>L thyroid enlargement, which she says has been 
increasing since US.  Patient was continued on her home 
methimazole of 20 mg. 
 
 # Anemia - Patient has known CKD. There may be some component 
of nutritional deficiency, poor PO intake, s/p ileostomy. 
Patient did not require transfusion in the unit or on the 
medicine floor.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came to us with shortness of breath and we found that you 
likely had a pneumonia and a loculated pleural effusion. Our 
Thoracic surgeons drained the fluid and added a chest tube which 
drained the remaining fluid. A repeat CT shows no pneumonia or 
signs of malignancy. We had endocrine see you who recommended 
seeing an ophthalmologist for your hyperthyroidism. We removed 
nearly 8 liters of fluid from you for a heart failure 
exacerbation. We are changing your Lasix to Toresemide which is 
better absorbed. We are discharging you on 30 mg daily. Please 
follow up with your cardiologist for labs and adjustment of the 
dose. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you the best!
Your ___ Team.

History of Present Illness:
___ female with hx of severe COPD on home oxygen, morbid 
obesity, hx CAD s/p PCI, chronic pseudotumor cerebri, presents 
from OSH where she originally presented for an ___ guided lumbar 
puncture for therapeutic drainage. The patient had lost the keys 
to her portable oxygen tanks and went to an OSH for a 
therapeutic LP without her oxygen. However in waiting for her 
procedure, she developed some chest pain and was noted to be 
hypoxic to the 50% on RA. Her chest pain resolved within minutes 
and she was placed on 4L oxygen and her O2 sats went up to 87% 
and an ABG was performed and was ___. A CXR was obtained 
and reportedly had evidence of an infiltrate. She was given 
nebulizers, steroids, and moxifloxacin and was transfered to 
___ for ___ guided lumbar puncture.
.
In the ___ ED, initial VS were: 98 85 159/89 18 91% 4L. She 
received labs notable for lactate 2.4, HCT 54, HCO3 32 and blood 
cultures were sent. CXR showed hyperexpansion without clear 
evidence of an infiltrate or pulmonary edema. She received a CT 
head which was consistent with pseudotumor cerebri. She received 
duonebs and vancomycin was added to her antibiotic regimen. 
Oxygen saturations were in the ___ on 4L NC. She reports her 
baseline oxygenation saturation is 82%. She was admitted to the 
MICU for oxygen monitoring while she awaits ___ guided LP. Access 
includes 2 PIV 20G on the right. 
.  
On arrival to the MICU, she temporarily endorsed mild chest 
heaviness, no radiation, no associated SOB, nausea or 
paresthesias. This pain quickly resolved without intervention. 
She has had chronic headaches, worse lately despite recently 
starting acetazolamide, associated with peripheral vision loss 
and visual scotomas. She is taking vicodin as needed for the 
pain. Denies cough, increased sputum production, wheezing or 
fever/chills. No sick contacts. She feels her breathing is at 
baseline.  
.
Prior to transfer on the floor, the patient reports improvement 
in her breathing and endorses continued headache that involves 
the back of her head and is throbbing in quality. When the 
headaches are at their worst they are associated with blurry 
vision and "floaters." She has also noted some crusting and 
dryness of her eyes that she has been treating with blephamide. 
She also endorses increased lethargy, fatigue, and sleepiness 
that she attributes to the narcotic medicine that she has been 
taking to manage her headaches. She has also has reportedly been 
more confused recently, not recounting recent events and has 
been taking less POs. At this time, she denied any fevers, 
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or abdominal 
pain. Of note, her O2 saturations on 2L oxygen are in the high 
___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with severe COPD on 2L home oxygen, chronic 
pseudotumor cerebri, with underlying chronic hypoxia, presents 
from OSH with hypoxia and headaches here for ___ guided lumbar 
puncture for therapeutic drainage.  
.  
#Hypoxia: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have O2 sats 
in the mid-80s on 4L. Her CXR demonstrated evidence of mild CHF 
and she was diuresed with her home dose of lasix and admitted to 
the MICU for oxygen monitoring. Her acetazolamide was held given 
its potential to exacerbate her hypercarbia. She maintained her 
oxygen saturations and was transferred to the floor where her 
oxygen was weaned to 4L while being treated with her home 
regimen of nebulizers and Spiriva for her history of COPD. Given 
that she had not formally seen a pulmonologist for the workup of 
her hypoxia, she was setup with outpatient follow-up with ___ 
Pulmonary at discharge. It was also felt that the patient likely 
has obstructive sleep apnea given her body habitus, or even some 
hypoventilation syndrome. Given the possible complexity of her 
sleep-breathing patterns, Sleep Medicine recommended that the 
patient follow-up with them in clinic as well, to discuss Sleep 
Study and CPAP/BiPAP.   
.
#Pseudotumor cerebri: Upon admission, the patient complained of 
headaches that were consistent with her history of pseudotumor 
cerebri that was subsequently confirmed on a head-CT. Her 
acetazolamide was held given concern for exacerbating her 
hypercarbia. Throughout her admission, her headaches were stable 
without any visual symptoms and appropriately controlled with 
tylenol and oxycodone. Her aspirin and plavix were held 
(patient's husband reported that he had not given these to her 
X2 weeks given her somnolence on pain meds for her headaches). 
She subsequently received an ___ guided therapeutic LP (___) 
and tolerated it well. Her headaches resolved following her LP 
and aspirin and plavix were restarted. Per the patient, she 
often can go months to years after a therapeutic LP without 
symptoms or need for retapping (last LP in ___. 
.
#Bradycardia: Prior to transfer from the MICU, the patient was 
noted to have HRs in the 40-50s which continued while on the 
floor. She was asymptomatic, and her EKG was notable for sinus 
bradycardia with no conduction defects.  Her metoprolol dose was 
adjusted and her HR increased to the ___ with activity.  She was 
discharged on a lower dose of metoprolol.
.
Inactive Issues:
.
#Eye Crusting: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have 
mild crusting of her left eyelid without any evidence of 
conjunctivitis or blepheritis. She was continued on her home 
blephamide cream and her crusting improved over the course of 
her hospitalization
.  
#CAD and history of MI: During her hospitalization, the patient 
acknowledged some chest heaviness without radiation, dyspnea, 
nausea, or paresthesias that resolved within minutes. Her EKG 
was without ST/T changes and her cardiac enzymes were normal. 
She had no subsequent episodes of chest pain throughout her 
hospitalization and was continued on her home regimen of 
lipitor, metoprolol and imdur. According to records obtained 
from ___ where the patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization in ___, the patient has three Cypher (DES) 
stents in her LAD distribution. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient NEEDS to have outpatient pulmonology follow-up. Her 
pulmonary disease is very poorly controlled at this point and 
she is at risk of rapidly worsening from Cor Pulmonale. This 
information was discussed at length with the patient, who has an 
appointment with ___ Pulmonary. 
- Patient should have outpatient sleep study. She has an 
appointment with ___ Sleep Medicine 
- Please follow-up heart rate as metoprolol dose was adjusted as 
inpatient to 12.5mg BID given bradycardia.
- Patient demonstrates significant interest in smoking 
cessation. QuitWorks and Nicotine patches were provided to the 
patient. She should discuss this with her primary care 
physician, as it will help with her ongoing lung disease
