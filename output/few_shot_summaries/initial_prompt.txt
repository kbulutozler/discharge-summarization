ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with a recent admission 
___ ___ for multifocal pneumonia complicated by chronic 
respiratory failure further complicated recurrent PNA x2 at 
rehab s/p trach/PEG, decannulated on ___. She presented for 
this admission with 2 days of dyspnea and productive cough, and 
was found to be hypoxemic requiring high-flow oxygen. CXR showed 
possible pneumonia and completed course of antibiotics 
(Vanc/ceftazidime, Day 1: ___. Her respiratory failure was 
thought to be secondary to recurrent aspiration related to her 
neuromuscular disease. She was given hypertonic saline nebs, 
guaiafenesin, Duonebs, pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve. She 
required intubation, and was unable to be weaned off the 
ventilator. After numerous goals of care discussions with the 
ICU team, her outpatient pulmonologist, palliative care, and her 
family, decision was made to undergo trach/PEG on ___. She 
tolerated this well, and was able to be weaned off the 
ventilator by ___, when she was transferred to floor. Cuff 
pressures were high, but patient had been tolerating this well. 
She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

=========================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES
-- NEW: senna PRN and Colace PRN constipation
-- HELD: loperamide (as noted above, consider low dose trial if 
she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools. 
[ ] Continue to discuss goals of care with patient  
[ ] Patient will follow up with the interventional 
pulmonologists for further monitoring of her tracheostomy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:
Summary: The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has allergies to penicillins and oxybutynin. The patient's chief complaint was hypoxia, dyspnea, productive cough, and congestion, which she experienced for the past two days. She was previously intubated and had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was referred to the emergency department for stoma closure and was found to have tachypnea, rhonchorous lungs, and a stoma site. The patient was given various medications, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and cefepime. She was also given oxygen therapy and had a flutter valve inserted. The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, and normal abdominal examination. The patient's laboratory results showed anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Imaging studies revealed extensive atelectasis in the lower lungs, which could not exclude a superimposed pneumonia. The patient was discharged with a tracheostomy mask and speaking valve, and was advised to use a flutter valve and oxygen therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who initially presented 
with severe abdominal pain. At that time, no obvious findings on 
CT scan and no obvious leak was appreciated. Given her pain and 
significant CT findings, it was decided that she would benefit 
from a diagnostic laparoscopy. At that time, I was concerned 
that she may actually have a gastric perforation and may have a 
gallbladder issue that could potentially be addressed 
laparoscopically. Thus, we decided to start the case 
laparoscopically with potential conversion to an open procedure 
if a significant
lesion in the stomach was appreciated. The risks and benefits of 
the procedure were described in detail to the patient. Despite 
these risks, she chose to proceed with surgery. She was found to 
have a gastric perforation and therefore converted to 
exploratory laparotomy with ___ patch and placement of a 
Pravena vac. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a IV dialudid 
PCA and then transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone 
once tolerating a diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression and nasojejunal 
tube in place for feeding.  On POD2 tube feeding were started 
through the doboff. On POD3 the NGT was accidently  removed by 
the patient when sneezing. She was kept NPO (except tube feeds). 
On POD5 she underwent upper GI leak test that was unclear and 
therefore was repeated on POD7 and negative for leak. Doboff was 
removed and she was given a regular diet with good tolerability. 
H.Pylori result was positive and therefore she was started on 
quadruple therapy once tolerating a diet. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. H.Pylori quadrupal therapy 
started and prescribed 2 week course. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
