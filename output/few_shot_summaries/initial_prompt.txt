History of Present Illness:
___ with PMH CAD, DM with CKD, Afib, HLP presents for the second 
time in a month with the complaint of exertional dyspnea and 
chest discomfort.  

Of note, pt was recently seen here ___ with the complaint of 
shortness of breath after dialysis.  She was diagnosed with 
volume overload, underwent ultrafiltration and diuresis and was 
discharged to rehab.

Since that time, the patient notes that she initially felt 
better but would still get short of breath with minimal 
exertion.  She states that when she gets up to the bathroom from 
her bed, she feels acutely short of breath.  This symptom is 
associated with a burning sensation in her substernal region 
that radiates directly upward towards her throat.  This morning 
she was walking into the ___ clinic when she began to feel 
those symptoms.  As she was recently hospitalized with similar 
symptoms in ___, the Renal doctors ___ with 
___ and removed 3L.  Her symptoms persisted and she 
was then sent to the ___ ED.

In the ED, the patient was still having symptoms.  An EKG showed 
slight <1mm ST depressions in the lateral leads.  She was given 
ASA 325, and a SL nitroglycerin relieved her chest discomfort.  
Labs were notable for a troponin level of 0.08, and a d-dimer 
was positive.  Subsequent CTA was negative for PE or aortic 
dissection.   She was then transferred up to the Cardiology 
Floor.

On the floor, the patient is without chest discomfort, shortness 
of breath, nausea, diaphoresis etc.  

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or 
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the 
other review of systems were negative.  
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Baseline systolic hypertension with an appropriate hemodynamic 
response 
to the Persantine infusion. Nuclear report sent separately. 

Coronary CT ___:
FINDINGS: 
  
Coronary arteries are coming out of conventional origin. 
  
LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY: The proximal portion and the mid 
portion of the 
left main coronary artery are patent with no appreciable 
atherosclerotic 
disease. 
  
LAD: Just at the bifurcation of left main coronary artery into 
LAD and 
circumflex, there is significant atherosclerotic disease 
represented as 
calcified and soft plaque with a significant narrowing/almost 
occluding the 
proximal portion of LAD by soft plaque. The mid and distal 
portions of the 
LAD are free of disease. 
  
LEFT CIRCUMFLEX: Extensive disease involves the entire left 
circumflex 
artery. At the proximal portion, no apparent obstruction of 
circumflex is 
noted. The patient has left dominance. 
  
RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: The right coronary artery is small, 
heavily calcified 
and potentially excluded. 
  
Extensive calcifications of the branches of LAD and circumflex 
are present. 
  
The airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi 
bilaterally. The 
pulmonary arteries are dilated as demonstrated on the recent CT 
of the chest 
consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Cardiomegaly is present 
. Diffuse 
ground-glass opacities within the lungs in conjunction with air 
trapping are 
noted. This appears similar to prior study from ___ and 
might reflect 
expiratory character of the study or mild volume overload. No 
pleural or 
pericardial effusion is noted. Left ventricular enlargement with 
prominence 
of the apical enlargement is seen.

diagonal with diffuse disease.  Lower pole 80% stenosis 
unchanged
from ___.
LCX:  Diffuse noncritical disease.  Small OM1 origin 40%.  OM2
has proximal 70% stenosis also unchanged from ___.
RCA:  Widely patent stent in a small vessel.  Diffuse 40-50%
stenoses.

Assessment & Recommendations
1.Unchanged angiography from ___.
2.Diastolic CHF with elevated LVEDP.
3.Medical management of CAD and CHF.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH of CAD, DM and ESRD presents with complaint of 
exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort.
  
# CORONARIES:
- Pt's story of exertional symptoms and atypical chest pain 
occur with roughly the same amount of exertion, relieved by 
nitroglycerin, and never at rest
- With PMH CAD, this presentation was concerning for stable 
angina
- initially treated with medical therapy with ASA, statin, and 
agressive afterload reduction
- PMIBI results concerning for multiterritorial perfusion 
defects
- Main concern regarding the results of her PMIBI was the 
possibility of left main disease, which would require a high 
risk cath
- This has been verified with the presence of high grade 
proximal LAD and LCx disease (left main equivalent) on Coronary 
CTA
- After a risk/benefit discussion with patient and family the 
decision was made for cardiac catheterization
  - Cath results failed to reveal any significant left main 
disease, or any worsening CAD from prior study in ___
- Pt was not placed on Plavix ___ concern regarding her 
anemia/thrombocytopenia and potential fall risk at home
.  
# PUMP:  
- last echo on ___ with preserved EF, clinically appears 
euvolemic but with evidence of elevated LVEDP to 32 during cath
- communicated to the Nephrology team that pt should be dialyzed 
as aggressively as possible to optimize fluid status, as volume 
overload could contribute to her symptoms of DOE
- dc'ed home lasix as not likely to be of any benefit, pt has 
very little UOP ___ ESRD
.  
#  HTN
- currently SBP 110's-150, will control to goal <140
- Continued home meds amlodipine, clonidine and lisinopril at 
current doses, increased imdur to 60mg daily
- if further titration is needed in the outpatient setting PO 
hydralazine would be a good option
.
# Skin Lesions
- Pt initially presented with eczematous lesion on face that was 
treated symptomatically with sarna lotion with subjective 
improvement per patient
- On ___, pt found to have R hand swelling and multiple areas 
of painless skin sloughing
- Dermatology consult was obtained, placed pt on regimen of 
steroid cream for her face, bactroban for the hand lesion which 
was thought to be skin sloughing from an infiltrated IV
- RUE US negative for DVT
- skin creams were continued as an outpatient regimen
.
# UTI
- pt with complaint of dysuria on admission, previous UCx + for 
VRE on last admission which was not treated
- Initially placed on empiric linezolid while cx data brewing 
___ prior untreated VRE
- ___, Ucx with pan sensitive E coli and other G+ flora, 
continued tx with cipro to complete 10d course.  Repeat culture 
with GNR

IMAGING:
Cardiac Cath: 
Assessment & Recommendations
1. Three vessel CAD. 
2. Probable chronic occlusion of left circumflex and OM1 with
ventricular tachycardia not due to acute ischemia.
3. Successful drug-eluting stent OM1.
4. ASA 81 mg; Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. 
5. Dobutamineat 5 micrograms. 
6. Echocardiogram to assess RV and LV function.

ECHO: ___
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30%) secondary to 
akinesis of the entire inferior wall, inferior septum, and 
dyskinesis of the basal infero-lateral wall. The apex, distal 
anterior and anteroseptal walls contract best. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The number 
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-severe regional and global systolic 
dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild global right ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild dilatation of the 
aortic root.  

CXR: ___
IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with unknown PMH presented s/p cardiac arrest, with 
diffuse coronary disease s/p DES to OM1, transferred to ICU 
intubated.

#. Cardiac Arrest: s/p cardiac arrest likely scarring causing 
ventricular arrhythmia. Not felt to be due to acute ischemia.  
Now rewarmed and extubated. Unclear etiology of VT, will be seen 
by EP regarding need for ICD as well as cardiac MRI to evaluate 
for scar which may have contributed.

#Fever: patient spiking while on warming protocol requiring cool 
water to slow warming process, likely in setting of infection.  
Patient has been cultured when he spikes. Possibly related to 
GPC in respiratory cx, however had witnessed aspiration event. 
Initially on vanc/zosyn/flagyl, however transitioned on day 5 to 
levofloxacin po, to complete total 8-day course

# CAD: Severe 2 vessel disease, 60% in mid and distal LAD; 
Chronic total of mid-distal L cx; ___ occlusion of OM1; L 
dominant; RCA small and totally occluded; Distal ___ likely 
old; OM1 also difficult, likely old. Fixed OM1 w/ DES. Unclear 
if this was STEMI. More likely arrhythmia secondary to severe 
CAD and scarring. Lipid panel okay. A1C 5.8%.
- continue aspirin
- continue ticagrelor 90 BID
- continue atorvastatin 80 daily 
- start metoprolol 25mg  TID
- start low dose lisinopril

# Respiratory Failure: Resolved. S/P cardiac arrest and 
intubated. Had an episode of aspiration.  Will treat for 
aspiration pneumonia with oral course levoflox.

# Acute congestive heart failure: ECHO showing LV systolic

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted this hospitalization following a cardiac 
arrest. You underwent a cooling of your body temperature to help 
decrease any negative effects on the brain following cardiac 
arrest. The likely cause of your arrest is an arrythmia as a 
result of scarring from coronary artery disease. 

In order to assess the perfusion of the heart by the coronary 
arteries you underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed 
multiple blockages in the conroary arteries. We were able to 
place a stent in one of the arteries; the obtuse marginal branch 
of the left circumflex artery that feeds the side portion of the 
heart muscle.

At the time of your cardiac arrest your heart pupming function 
was depressed. A most recent echocardiogram revealed that the 
pumping function has greatly improved since the time of your 
arrest.

You have been started on the following new medications:
Aspirin 81 mg daily: this is taken to decrease clot in the 
coronary arteries

Atorvastatin 80mg daily: this is a cholesterol medication taken 
to decrease worsening of plaque formation.

Lisinopril 5mg daily: this decreases the resistance the heart 
has to pump against and thereby decreased the blood pressure

Metoprolol XL 100mg daily: this medication decresases the 
workload of the heart by decreasing the heart rate and thereby 
the blood pressure

Ticagelor 90mg two times a day: This medication decreases the 
risk of clot formation where the stent was placed. 

KCL 20meq daily: you have required Potaassium daily since your 
admission. You should take this daily and then have labs checked 
on ___ by visiting nursing to assess your response. 

PLEASE CONTINUE:
Metformin 100mg XL twice a day for your diabetes
Sertraline 200mg daily for depression
Levothyroxeine 50mcg daily
 
PLEASE HOLD until seen by your PCP/Cardiologist:
Wellbutrin
Mirtazapine

****Failure to take the Ticagelor and the aspirin could result 
in a lifethreatening heart attack**** 

You have been set up with a Lifevest. The details of this device 
have been discussed with you. If you go into a lifethreatening 
arrythmia again, this device will detect that arrythmia and 
deliver an electric shock to return you to a normal sinus 
rythym. The plan is for you to eventually receieve an internal 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in the future once your heart 
has been given time to recover from your recent cardiac arrest. 
This will be discussed in follow up with the electrophysiology 
team as an outpatient.

You should avoid stressful situations and exercise while you are 
wearing the lifevest. You also CANNOT drive with the lifevest. 
You may participate in your reguilar activities including 
walking as long as this does not cause you physical strain.  
  
You will need a variety of follow up appointments as detailed 
below.

You will need labs in 6 weeks to assess your liver function and 
cholesterol panel since we increased your statin or cholesterol 
medication.  You will also need your electrolytes and your 
kidney function checked on ___ as we have started 
you on a medication called Lisinopril and a potassium 
supplement. 

Today we discussed heart failure and the need to weigh yourself 
every day before breakfast as well as the improtance of 
following a low salt diet. If your weight goes up by more than 3 
lbs in 2 days you should call Dr. ___ cardiologist). 

If you have any questions or concerns related to your symptoms 
or your hospitalization you can call the heartline which has 
been given to you with your discharge paperwork.
