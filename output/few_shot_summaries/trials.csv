"The patient is a 35-year-old female who was admitted with abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as gallstone pancreatitis. She had a history of gestational diabetes, Caesarean section, and GERD. She was also experiencing pruritus, dark urine, yellowing of her eyes, and fatigue. Her laboratory results showed elevated LFTs and lipase levels. She underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and biopsy of the ampulla, which was negative for malignancy. Her LFTs were slow to resolve, but she remained pain-free and was tolerating a low-fat diet. She was discharged with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician and to schedule an outpatient cholecystectomy. Her medications at discharge included diphenhydrAMINE for pruritus and outpatient lab work to monitor her LFTs.","The patient is a 35-year-old female who was admitted with abdominal pain and a history of gallstone pancreatitis. She underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biopsy of the ampulla, which resulted in no malignant cells detected. However, her laboratory values, particularly her liver enzymes, were slow to resolve. She was discharged with plans to have her laboratory values monitored as an outpatient and to schedule an outpatient cholecystectomy.

The patient experienced pruritis, which was partially relieved with diphenhydrAMINE. Her treatment plans include following up with her primary care physician for laboratory values, contacting surgery to schedule a cholecystectomy in the near future, and discontinuing ibuprofen due to its potential to exacerbate gastrointestinal issues.

The patient's medications upon discharge include diphenhydrAMINE for pruritis and routine laboratory work to monitor her progress.

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a renal transplant. He has a neurogenic bladder, hypertension, diabetes, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). He was recently hospitalized for septic shock caused by ischemic colitis and Klebsiella urosepsis. He was treated with antibiotics and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, where he developed worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea. He was transferred to the emergency department, where he was found to have a large stool burden and continued evidence of proctocolitis. He was diagnosed with partially reversible inferolateral perfusion defect and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. He was also found to have a urinary tract infection caused by multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli).

The patient's allergies include antihistamines and glipizide. He has a history of chronic back pain, COPD, DM2, HTN, HLD, and recurrent UTIs. He has also had a colon adenomatous polyp and umbilical hernia repair.

The patient's medications at discharge include cellcept and tacro for his renal transplant, as well as antibiotics for his UTI.","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in the past and takes immunosuppressive medications Cellcept/Tacro. He has a history of chronic neurogenic bladder, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and recurring urinary tract infections. He was recently hospitalized for septic shock caused by ischemic colitis and Klebsiella ureasepsis. During his current admission, he complained of abdominal pain and underwent a colonoscopy that revealed erosions, ulcers, and stricture in the distal sigmoid and rectum, suggestive of ischemic colitis. Imaging studies showed near-complete resolution of previous residuals but persistence of fecal burden and urinary retention. Microbiological analysis revealed Escherichia coli resistant to multiple antibiotics, necessitating treatment with meropenem.

He underwent pMIBI scan which didn't identify any reversible perfusion defects according to cardiology consultation. His creatinine levels remained within range despite receiving immunosuppressives and hydration. He was followed closely by GI, CRS, ID teams, and transplant nephrologists, resulting in ongoing treatments like Vanc, Flagyl, and Home Oxycarbonolin.
