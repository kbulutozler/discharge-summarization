Note: The pattern observed in the summaries is consistent with the format of the discharge reports.
Each summary provides a concise overview of the patient's condition, diagnosis, treatment, and post-discharge instructions.
The summary is written in a formal tone and includes key information such as the patient's age, sex, past medical history, chief complaint, medications, and activity status.
The summary also highlights any active issues, chronic/stable issues, and transitional issues relevant to the patient's care.
The output generated follows this pattern and provides a comprehensive summary of the patient's situation.
However, the exact wording and details may vary depending on the specific input data. 

In terms of generating a similar summary for the last report, one can observe that the patient is a 65-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain.
She has a past medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke in her family.
The patient's physical examination revealed a soft, tender abdomen with focal rebound and guarding.
Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests.
The patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, which revealed a gastric perforation.
She was converted to an exploratory laparotomy and underwent repair of the perforation with a patch and placement of a Pravena vac.
The patient was prescribed medications at discharge, including bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, pantoprazole, and tetracycline.
The patient was discharged home with instructions to avoid lifting weights greater than 20 pounds and to follow up with her surgeon.
The patient's mental status is clear and coherent, and her activity status is ambulatory-independent.
The patient is scheduled to follow up with her physician and has been provided with discharge instructions. 

Therefore, the summary for the last report would be: The patient is a 65-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain.
She has a past medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke in her family.
