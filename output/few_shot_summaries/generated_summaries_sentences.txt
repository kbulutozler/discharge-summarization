###SUMMARY: 
The patient is an 87-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of emphysematous cystitis.
He has a history of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, mechanical falls, and fractures, as well as coronary artery disease.
The patient's current medications include ketoconazole, hydrocortisone, leuprolide, and enoxaparin sodium.
He is also taking aspirin, metoprolol tartrate, and ferrous sulfate.


During his hospital stay, the patient underwent various tests and procedures, including a urinalysis, which revealed the presence of Escherichia coli.
He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and started on antibiotics.
The patient also had a computed tomography (CT) scan of his torso, which showed findings consistent with emphysematous cystitis, as well as gas in the right renal collecting system, retroperitoneum, and adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall.


The patient's condition improved during his hospital stay, and he was eventually discharged to an extended care facility.
His discharge diagnoses included emphysematous cystitis, mechanical fall, metastatic prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation.
The patient was instructed to continue his antibiotic treatment and to follow up with his healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.

Chief Complaint:
Acute STEMI
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left heart catheterization with drug eluting stent placement
 
History of Present Illness:

This is a 57 year old gentleman with PMHx of HTN, HL and remote 
history of cocaine abuse presenting with sudden onset, crushing 
central chest pain radiating down both arms accompanied by 
dyspnea and diaphoresis starting approximately one hour prior to 
arrival in our ER.

Initial ER ECG reveals STEMI pattern involving inferior leads 
with reciprocal depression laterally.
Stat echo performed 
revealing basal inferior wall motion abnormality suggesting 
inferior STEMI.
Cath lab activated and patient underwent urgent 
angioplasty revealing subtotal occlusion of RCA necessitating 
deployment of drug-eluting stent resulting in TIMI 3 flow post-
PCI.

Pt's chest pain completely resolves immediately following PCI. 

However, shortly thereafter develops vasovagal reaction with 
transient drop in sys BP into 80's lasting only briefly 
resolved with administration of IVF boluses and brief Trendelenburg positioning.
 

Post procedure complications none thus far aside from vasovagal 
episode previously mentioned and minor access site ecchymoses.

Plan remains close observation and optimization of post-procedure 
care with anticipated full recovery following uncomplicated 
acute MI with successful revascularization via PCI.
 

Cardiovascular Risk Factors:
HTN
HL
Remote Cocaine Abuse
Current Tobacco Use (1/2 ppd cigarettes smoker)

Hyperhomocysteinemia
 
Social History:
Employed part-time bartender (approximately 2 shifts weekly)

Married
Has 2 children living locally
 
Family History:
Significant cardiovascular history runs deep among paternal side 
of family, father died suddenly aged 47 attributed to acute MI 
never actually proven, maternal grandfather deceased of same 
aged 65.

 

Physical Exam:
General Appearance: Well nourished adult appearing older than 
stated age lying flat on table resting quietly without overt 
distress
Blood Pressure: 126/88 (post-procedurally measured in right arm)

Heart Rate: 78 beats per minute regular
Peripheral Circulation: Cool and clammy although warming slightly 
under warmed blanket applied to trunk.
 

Head & Neck Inspection: Normal alignment without deformity or 
gross asymmetry observed.
Conjunctival pallor present without 
hemorrhages, icterus, nor carotenemia appreciated.
Eyelids open, 
eyes equal tracking movements normally.

External auditory meatus inspection reveals cerumen impaction AD.
Nose without nasal polyps or turbinate hypertrophy upon speculum 
evaluation.
Tongue mid-line when protruded neither deviates nor 
develops fasciculations.
Skin exhibits warmth without excessive 
dryness evident on cursory tactile exploration.
Palmar erythema 
observed along thenar eminences bilaterally indicative probable 
cirrhosis versus alcohol exposure in distant past.
Bilateral hand grasp firm without subtle decrement suggestive intrinsic musculoskeletal pathology, finger flexion preserved indicating spared integrity corticosp


###SUMMARY: 
The patient is a 55-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe three-vessel coronary artery disease.
She has a history of hypertension, ketoacidosis, chronic anemia, Sjögren's syndrome, hypothyroidism, depression, ulcerative colitis, and diabetes mellitus.
The patient's chief complaint was chest pain, and she had undergone a cardiac catheterization that revealed anterior ischemia.
After the CABG procedure, she was admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit for post-operative care.
The patient's post-operative course was uncomplicated, and she was extubated, alert, and oriented on post-operative day 1.
She was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery and rehabilitation.
The patient's insulin pump was resumed on post-operative day 4, and she was discharged home on post-operative day 5 with instructions for wound care, diet, and follow-up appointments.



###SUMMARY: 
The patient is a 51-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital for a living non-related renal transplant.
He has a history of Crohn's disease, status post total colectomy with ileoanal pull-through, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to medication toxicity and chronic dehydration.
He has been on hemodialysis since 2003.
The patient underwent a successful transplant surgery with a cousin as the living donor.
Post-operatively, he received immunosuppression therapy, including antilymphocyte globulin (ATG), Cellcept, and Solu-Medrol.
He also started taking tacrolimus (Prograf).
The patient's urine output decreased briefly, but responded well to intravenous fluids and albumin administration.
His creatinine levels decreased significantly post-transplant, indicating good graft function.
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition, with instructions to follow up with lab draws and visits to the Transplant office.
