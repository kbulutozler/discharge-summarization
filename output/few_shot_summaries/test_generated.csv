ACTIVE ISSUES  
=================
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with a recent admission 
___ ___ for multifocal pneumonia complicated by chronic 
respiratory failure further complicated recurrent PNA x2 at 
rehab s/p trach/PEG, decannulated on ___. She presented for 
this admission with 2 days of dyspnea and productive cough, and 
was found to be hypoxemic requiring high-flow oxygen. CXR showed 
possible pneumonia and completed course of antibiotics 
(Vanc/ceftazidime, Day 1: ___. Her respiratory failure was 
thought to be secondary to recurrent aspiration related to her 
neuromuscular disease. She was given hypertonic saline nebs, 
guaiafenesin, Duonebs, pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve. She 
required intubation, and was unable to be weaned off the 
ventilator. After numerous goals of care discussions with the 
ICU team, her outpatient pulmonologist, palliative care, and her 
family, decision was made to undergo trach/PEG on ___. She 
tolerated this well, and was able to be weaned off the 
ventilator by ___, when she was transferred to floor. Cuff 
pressures were high, but patient had been tolerating this well. 
She was remained stable on the floor on trach mask 40% and was 
able to use her speaking valve with good effect. IP deferred 
trach upsize given tolerance of speaking valve and stable 
respiratory status.  

# ASPIRATION: Patient agreed to PEG as solution for recurrent 
aspiration events, however, during MICU course patient reported 
desire to eat. After discussion of risks of aspiration, which 
patient accepted, decision was made allow for PO intake. She was 
able to tolerate thin liquids and ground dysphagia diet on the 
floor. Due to good PO intake, continuous tube feeds were 
discontinued. Nutrition recommended bolus feeds of Jevity 1.2 of 
5 cans/day to meet nutritional needs.  

# BACTERURIA
# CHRONIC URINARY INCONTINENCE s/p Botox: Urinalysis with 
moderate leukocytes and few bacteria. Antibiotics as above. 

# ___ DISEASE: Complicated significant dysautonomia and 
orthostasis. Continued home carbidopa-levodopa, midodrine, and 
fludrocortisone. Speech and swallow consulted as above.

# Orthostastic hypotension: The patient had intermittent 
asymptomatic hypotension while ___ the hospital.  This was 
attributed to her chronic orthostatic hypotension, and it 
resolved with minimal intervention.  Continued home midodrine 
and fludricortisone.

# Diarrhea with risk of constipation: The patient developed 
diarrhea ___ the hospital, likely related to her new tube feeds.  
Adjustments were made to the tube feeding formula to try to 
decrease her diarrhea.  Should it persist, despite her risk of 
constipation, consideration should be given to starting low-dose 
infrequent loperamide.

=========================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=========================
# Insomnia: Ramelteon while inpatient as melatonin 
non-formulary.
# Urge Incontinence: Held mirabegron 25 mg oral as 
non-formulary, resumed on discharge   
# GERD: Changed home ranitidine to liquid 
# Depression: Continued home fluoxetine  
# History of C. diff: Continued probiotic  
# Other: Continued multivitamin.

=========================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES
-- NEW: senna PRN and Colace PRN constipation
-- HELD: loperamide (as noted above, consider low dose trial if 
she has continued diarrhea, exercising caution given her 
increased risk of constipation due to her ___ Disease), 
magnesium oxide (not requiring significant repletion throughout 
hospitalization)
-- MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PLACED DOWN G-TUBE
[ ] NUTRITION: patient accepts risk of aspiration with PO 
intake. She has tolerated diet of thin liquids/ground dysphagia 
diet well. Recommended for Osmolite 1.5 x 4cans/day, can 
downtitrate # of cans/day pending PO intake. Can consider adding 
banana flakes to reduce loose stools. 
[ ] Continue to discuss goals of care with patient  
[ ] Patient will follow up with the interventional 
pulmonologists for further monitoring of her tracheostomy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted for 
difficulty breathing. During your hospitalization, your 
breathing worsened and you had to be intubated (have a breathing 
tube placed down your throat) and stay ___ the medical intensive 
care unit (MICU). They were unable to wean you off the 
ventilator so you underwent a procedure to have a tracheostomy 
and PEG tube placed. You tolerated the procedure well and you 
were able to remain stable on a trach mask at 40% O2. 

There was a discussion held with you about the risk of eating. 
You stated that your quality of life was significantly impaired 
by not being able to eat and you accepted the risk of eating, 
including aspiration, infection, worsening respiratory status. 
You were able to tolerate a thin liquid and dysphagia diet 
during your hospitalization. You were on tube feeds but this was 
stopped when you were able to tolerate oral intake. You should 
continue bolus feeds with cans of Jevity 1.2 at 5 cans/day. You 
can decrease this as you tolerate more oral intake.

Please follow up with your physicians as below. 

Wishing you well,

Your ___ Care Team

Note: The pattern observed in the summaries is consistent with the format of the discharge reports. Each summary provides a concise overview of the patient's condition, diagnosis, treatment, and post-discharge instructions. The summary is written in a formal tone and includes key information such as the patient's age, sex, past medical history, chief complaint, medications, and activity status. The summary also highlights any active issues, chronic/stable issues, and transitional issues relevant to the patient's care. The output generated follows this pattern and provides a comprehensive summary of the patient's situation. However, the exact wording and details may vary depending on the specific input data. 
In terms of generating a similar summary for the last report, one can observe that the patient is a 65-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain. She has a past medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke in her family. The patient's physical examination revealed a soft, tender abdomen with focal rebound and guarding. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests. The patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, which revealed a gastric perforation. She was converted to an exploratory laparotomy and underwent repair of the perforation with a patch and placement of a Pravena vac. The patient was prescribed medications at discharge, including bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, pantoprazole, and tetracycline. The patient was discharged home with instructions to avoid lifting weights greater than 20 pounds and to follow up with her surgeon. The patient's mental status is clear and coherent, and her activity status is ambulatory-independent. The patient is scheduled to follow up with her physician and has been provided with discharge instructions. 
Therefore, the summary for the last report would be: The patient is a 65-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who initially presented 
with severe abdominal pain. At that time, no obvious findings on 
CT scan and no obvious leak was appreciated. Given her pain and 
significant CT findings, it was decided that she would benefit 
from a diagnostic laparoscopy. At that time, I was concerned 
that she may actually have a gastric perforation and may have a 
gallbladder issue that could potentially be addressed 
laparoscopically. Thus, we decided to start the case 
laparoscopically with potential conversion to an open procedure 
if a significant
lesion in the stomach was appreciated. The risks and benefits of 
the procedure were described in detail to the patient. Despite 
these risks, she chose to proceed with surgery. She was found to 
have a gastric perforation and therefore converted to 
exploratory laparotomy with ___ patch and placement of a 
Pravena vac. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a IV dialudid 
PCA and then transitioned to oral acetaminophen and oxycodone 
once tolerating a diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression and nasojejunal 
tube in place for feeding.  On POD2 tube feeding were started 
through the doboff. On POD3 the NGT was accidently  removed by 
the patient when sneezing. She was kept NPO (except tube feeds). 
On POD5 she underwent upper GI leak test that was unclear and 
therefore was repeated on POD7 and negative for leak. Doboff was 
removed and she was given a regular diet with good tolerability. 
H.Pylori result was positive and therefore she was started on 
quadruple therapy once tolerating a diet. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. H.Pylori quadrupal therapy 
started and prescribed 2 week course. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest 
radiographs: 
  
Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces. No 
evidence of 
pneumonia or CHF. 
.
___ Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.   
A patent foramen ovale is present with right to left shunting of 
agitated saline contrast during Valsalva.  
.
___ Lower Extremity doppler ultrasound
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in right or left lower 
extremity.
.
___ Cardiac Catheterisation
Change for 6 ___ XB3 guide.  The initial plan was to pass the
wire as the primary reperfusion device.  A Pilot 50 Wire was
passed in a prolapsed fashion but this did not restore flow. 
Given that the patient was pain free and the small territory at
risk, it was decided to avoid further attempts at recanalization
(with balloon angioplasty) given risk of dissection, 
perforation.
The patient had intermittent chest pain at the end of the
procedure and was started on IV TNG and administered opiates 
with
resolution of chest pain.  He left the laboratory in stable
condition.
.
___ Foot XRay
Three views show the bony structures and joint spaces to be
essentially within normal limits. No dorsal swelling or evidence 
of erosion
is appreciated. No calcaneal spurs.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M w/ PMH of prostate CA, HTN, presenting with distal 
apical NSTEMI.
.
# APICAL LAD STEMI:  Distal LAD thrombosis with distal apical 
infarct, s/p unsuccessful recanalisation during cardiac 
catheterisation.  No other evidence of coronoary atherosclerosis 
was found. Echocardiogram whowed preserved EF and no ventricular 
wall motion abnormalities. However, he was noted to have a 
patent formane ovale.  Given absence of atherosclerotic disease, 
PFO and known CA prostate, thromboembolic event from a possible 
proximal DVT remains a possible etiology for his STEMI.  Cardiac 
enzymes peaked ___ and trended down prior to discharge. He 
was treated with a heparin drip for 2 days after the procedure, 
as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol.  He was started on 
lisinopril and atorvastatin, but these were held in the setting 
of acute kidney injury.  He will need to continue aspirin 
lifelong and clopidogrel for at least one year given his 
prothrombotic state.  Atorvastation was restarted at the time of 
discharge.
.  
# s/p CATH: unsuccessful attempt at wire recanalisation of 
distal LAD.
.
# THROMBOEMBOLISM: Cardiac cath shows no evidence of coronary 
atherosclerosis.  MI site is unusual and patient has PFO, 
history of prostate cancer, prothrombotic state. LENIs were 
negative, but did not include an evaluation of the iliac 
arteries.  He will continue aspirin and plavix for 
anticoagulation following discharge.  
.
# Fever: Etiology unclear. UA, CXR clear.  Urine cultures and 
blood cultures pending.  However, timing of fever suggests 
possible link with gout flare.  Other etiologies include: 
infection, post-MI, thromboembolism/PE, B-symptoms from cancer. 
His fever curve trended down spontaneously prior to discharge.
.
# Thigh pain - bilateral. Could be from strenous workout pt 
reports. CKs coming down but CK so out of proportion elevated 
compared to MB. We just started statin which can cause myopathy 
but states thigh pain since presentation. Pt without significant 
CAD that we know of.  We held his statin, but restarted it at 
the time of discharge.
.
# ___: Cr of 1.4 on ___ up from baseline of 1.0.  Could be 
secondary to high 
CK. Uric acid was 6.6, urinalysis was clear.  We gave him a 
small fluid bolus. 
.
# Right ankle pain - Most likely gout flair. pt with history of 
gout. A foot Xray was performed which showed no pathology.  His 
pain was controlled with percocet and colchicine.   
.  
# HTN: BP was high on presentation and he was initially on a 
nitro drip, but this was rapidly weaned and he was treated with 
metoprolol instead.  He was also started on lisinopril, but this 
was held given ___. He will need reevaluation
.
# Cardiac Risk factors: patient has hypertension.
Lipid panel was unremarkable.  HbA1C was pending at the time of 
discharge.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ACE inhibitor was held due to creatinine 
elevation.
Please reassess hypertension and creatinine as an outpatient and 
consider restarting an ACE inhibitor if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted with a heart 
attack. We performed a cardiac catheterization which showed a 
small blockage in the blood supply to the apex of your heart, 
but no other abnormalities in the blood flow to your heart.  We 
attempted to open this blockage, but were unable to do so and 
did not attempy further since the reduction of heart function 
was very small.  An echocardiogram was performed and this 
confirmed that your heart was beating normally.  The 
echocardiogram also showed that you have an open flap in your 
heart forming an abnormal connection between the right and left 
sides of your heart (a patent foramen ovale).  This kind of flap 
is found in over 10% of people.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
-STARTED Aspirin
-STARTED Clopidogrel
-STARTED Metoprolol
-STARTED Atorvastatin
-STARTED Oxycodone and Colchicine for pain
-STOPPED your home benzapril
 
Followup Instructions:
___
 

Output:","The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has a history of prostate cancer, treated with radiation therapy, and no other significant past medical history. He is allergic to Gadolinium-containing agents. 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. An attempt was made to open the lesion, but it was not successful, and the patient was treated medically to avoid a potential procedural complication. 

At discharge, the patient's vital signs were stable, and he was prescribed medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. His physical examination was normal, with no signs of cardiac failure or respiratory distress. 

Laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage, but his kidney and liver function tests were normal. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, V4-6, consistent with a STEMI. 

The patient's chest X-ray and echocardiogram showed normal heart and lung structures, with no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure."," The patient is a 56-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a distal apical NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a total occlusion of the very distal LAD. He was treated medically to avoid a potential procedural complication. Post-procedure, the patient had some mild chest discomfort, which was similar to his presenting pain. He was started on a nitro drip with improvement of his pain, although he continues to complain of intermittent chest pain. The patient was admitted to the CCU in stable condition. He was diagnosed with a patent foramen ovale and had a history of prostate cancer. He was also diagnosed with a gout flare. The patient was prescribed medications at discharge, including aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, oxycodone, and colchicine. The patient will need to continue aspirin lifelong and clopidogrel for at least one year given his prothrombotic state. The patient will need reevaluation of his hypertension and creatinine as an outpatient and consider restarting an ACE inhibitor if indicated. The patient will also need to follow up with his physician for further monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ with a history of MI (___), CHF (EF 55-60% ___, GI bleed 
s/p ileostomy c/b bowel obstructions, CKD who was transferred to 
___ from OSH for L sided pneumonia and pleural effusion, 
admitted to MICU for medical management of left pleural 
effusion, hypotension (low at baseline), ___ on CKD, and 
electrolyte derangement. 
 
# L Pleural Effusion - Etiology was considered in setting of 
pneumonia (leukocytosis with left shift, cough, though afebrile) 
vs. malignancy vs. CHF exacerbation. Pleural fluid studies were 
consistent with exudative effusion (elevated LDH, fluid/serum 
protein .46), making infectious etiology most likely. Patient 
initially received CTX/Azithro at OSH. Given GI symptoms in 
setting of slight hyponatremia, we sent Legionella antigen, 
which were negative. In the MICU we continued CTX and 
Azithromycin. CT chest showed loculated non hemorrhagic 
effusions. No evidence of occult malignancy. Pleural fluid was 
sent for cytology which was negative. 

# Shock - Patient was initially hypotensive to SBPs ___. 
Distributive is most likely in setting of pulmonary infection. 
Lactate was normal. Pressures become stable with SBPs ___ 
s/p Albumin 25g IV in the ED. Cardiogenic etiology is less 
likely given normal TTE in ___. We continued to treat infection 
as described above.   
 
# Congestive Heart Failure - EF 55-60% on TTE in ___. Patient 
has been taking Lasix 40mg PO TID at home. BNP 28329 (patient 
does have CKD, 797 in ___. She was volume overloaded on exam 
(marked JVD and acute onset ___. Possibly exacerbated in the 
setting of paroxysmal afib. Diuresis was held due to hypotension 
in the MICU; however, on the floor she was digressed with 40 mg 
IV lasix for a total of 9L net negative for LOS. Her lasix was 
switched to 30 mg of Torsemide on discharge for better 
absorption. 

#Pre renal ___: On admission Creatinine elevated to 2.5. On 
___ it was 1.03, though elevated to 3.3 in ___. Likely 
cardiorenal physiology in setting of CHF and RAS (BUN/Cr 30). 
C/b hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and ACD. She 
was diuresed and her Cr improved to normal with discharge of
