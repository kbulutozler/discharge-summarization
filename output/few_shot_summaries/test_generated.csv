Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented to ___ and Delivery on ___ with loss of 
fluids and breech presentation. Decision made at that time to 
proceed with primary low transverse cesarean delivery. 

Postpartum, her course was complicated by preeclampsia, severe 
by blood pressures. Her serum labs were normal and P:C was 0.28 
on ___. On the evening of ___, she had a sustained severe 
blood pressure requiring one dose of fast-acting nifedipine. She 
was started on nifedipine 30mg daily that day, and after 3 days, 
was transitioned to labetalol 200mg q8h and uptitrated to 
labetalol 400mg po q8h starting ___. She remained asymptomatic 
and well throughout this time.

In addition, she had an episode of non-sustained tachycardia 
over the course of ___, for which complete workup, including 
EKG, repeat labs, and CTA were all reassuring. Etiology was 
thought to most likely be reflex tachycardia from nifedipine 
administration or insufficient oral intake.

Her postpartum course was otherwise uncomplicated. Her pain was 
treated with oral pain medications. She was continued on her 
home levothyroxine. She ambulated and her foley was discontinued 
and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was advanced without 
incident. 

By postpartum day 6, her blood pressures were stabilized in the 
normal to mild-range on an oral antihypertensive regimen. In 
addition, she was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating 
independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. 
She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was then 
discharged home in stable condition with postpartum outpatient 
follow-up scheduled.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with a history of multiple
percutaneous interventions for bilateral lower extremity
peripheral arterial disease, s/p left BKA in ___, now
presenting with non-healing ulcers of the right foot. Patient
underwent diagnostic angiogram in ___ to evaluate

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  During your hospitalization, you had surgery to 
remove unhealthy tissue on your lower extremity.  You tolerated 
the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the 
hospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a 
speedy and uneventful recovery.

LOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS

ACTIVITY 
ÂYou should keep your amputation site elevated and straight 
whenever possible.  This will prevent swelling of the stump and 
maintain flexibility in your joint.  
ÂIt is very important that you put no weight or pressure on 
your stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal 
properly. 
ÂYou may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if 
applicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and 
learn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  

MEDICATION
ÂBefore you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!  

ÂYou will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on 
discharge which  can be very constipating.  If you take 
narcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   
If constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest 
an additional over the counter laxative. 

ÂYou should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for 
pain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic 
pain medication.  You should require less pain medication each 
day.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  
Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter 
and prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you 
are taking in a day.

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
ÂYou may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or 
pools until you have permission from your surgeon and the 
incision is fully healed.
ÂAfter your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub 
the area. 

WOUND CARE:
ÂPlease keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that 
there is no pressure on the stump.    If there is no drainage, 
you may leave the incision open to air.  
ÂYour staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks.  At 
your followup appointment, we will see if the incision has 
healed enough to remove the staples. 
ÂBefore you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to 
replace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be 
fully healed. 

CALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___
ÂOpening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision 

ÂRedness, swelling or warmth in your stump.
ÂFever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening 
incisional/stump pain  

NO OTHER PROVIDER, EXCEPT YOUR VASCULAR SURGEON, SHOULD 
DETERMINE IF YOUR STAPLES ARE READY TO BE REMOVED FROM YOUR 
STUMP! 
  
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE 
VASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.   THE 
STAPLES WILL BE REMOVED IN THE OFFICE AT YOUR FOLLOWUP 
APPOINTMENT WHEN IT IS DETERMINED BY THE VASCULAR SURGEON THAT 
THE WOUND HAS SUFFICIENTLY HEALED.

 
Followup Instructions:

2. Cholelithiasis. 

MRCP (MR ABD ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Appearance consistent with hepatic edema, likely hepatitis. 
2. Abnormal gallbladder with marked gallbladder wall edema and 
gallstones, 
but the gallbladder is somewhat decompressed, suggesting this is 
secondary to hepatitis rather than cholecystitis. 
3. No common bile duct stones. 
4. Minimally complex cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney. 
foolow up in 6 months initially with ultrasound is recommended, 
though this may need MRI follow up. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented to the Emergency Department on ___ with acute onset periumbilical pain.  An abdominal 
ultrasound was suggestive of a 
'moderately distended gallbladder with mural edema and dependent 
stones; early acute cholecystitis should be considered' and 
cholelithiasis; LFTs were also elevated upon admission (T. bili. 
2.9)  While in the ED, intravenous fluids, pain/ nausea 
medication and intravenous antibiotics were administered.  He 
was subsequently admitted to the Acute Care Surgical service for 
ongoing management.  

Upon admission, the patient underwent an MRCP for evaluation of 
possible choledocholithiasis given elevated LFTs.  The MRCP was 
notable for 'appearance consistent with hepatic edema, likely 
hepatitis, abnormal gallbladder with marked gallbladder wall 
edema and gallstones' without evidence of common bile duct 
stones.  Additionally, a minimally complex cyst in the lower 
pole of the left kidney was noted with follow recommended in 6 
months. 

On HD2, an ERCP was attempted, but unsuccesssful due to 
Roux-en-Y anatomy.  Post-procedure, the patient's abdominal pain 
improved and LFTs trended downward suggesting passage of stones. 
 He was subsequently taken to the operating room on HD3 where he 
underwent a laparascopic cholecytectomy; see operative note for 
details.  Post-operatively, the patient remained afebrile with 
stable vital signs; intravenous antibiotics were not resumed.  
His diet was advanced to regular and well tolerated.  
Additionally, he was voiding adequately and ambulating 
independently.  He was subsequently discharged to home on POD1 
and will follow-up in ___ clinic in 2 weeks. Of note, while in 
the PACU, a pilonidal cyst without erythema was noted, which per 
patient, is chronic.  The patient was instructed to continue 
current management of dry dressings prn with regular inspection 
of site.  Warning signs were reviewed with patient with 
perceived good understanding. He will follow-up with his primary 
care provider for ongoing management.

EEG 
___: This telemetry captured no pushbutton 
activations. Routine 
sampling showed a normal background in wakefulness and in sleep. 
There 
were frequent bursts of left temporal theta slowing, many with 
sharp 
features, but without clear epileptiform discharges. There were 
no 
electrographic seizures. 

___: This telemetry caputed a single pushbutton activation 
that 
was not associated with a change in the EEG recording. Routine 
sampling 
showed rhythmic and sharply contoured activity at times 
particularly 
in the left temporal region, however no clearly epileptiform 
discharges 
were noted in this recording. Note is made of an irregular heart 

rhythm. 

___: This telemetry captured a single pushbutton activation 
that 
was not associated with a change in the EEG recording. Routine 
sampling 
showed focal left hemispheric slowing, which could be sharply 
contoured, 
however there were no clearly epileptiform discharges. No 
electrographic 
seizures were noted. Note is made of an irregular heart rhythm 

___: This telemetry captured four pushbutton activation for 
brief 
body twitches, which were not associated with a change in EEG 
recording. 
Routine sampling showed left hemispheric focal slowing with 
rhythmic 
left temporal slowing at times but no epileptiform features were 
seen. 
No electrographic seizures were recorded. Note is made of an 
irregular 
heart rate. 

___: No pushbutton activations were captured during this 
recording. Routine sampling showed mild intermittent left 
hemispheric 
focal slowing most prominent over the posterior quadrant with a 
few 
broad left temporal sharp waves. No electrographic seizures were 

captured. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ yo RHW with a history of a R temporal 
lobectomy and refractory epilepsy who presents as an LTM 
admission for characterization of events after ambulatory EEG 
revealed epileptiform activity over the left temporal lobe. 
She has been having events which she describes as dizzy spells 
with
some leg weakness. These were clustering in ___ and she has 
not had any events in the past several weeks. Given the concern 
that these represented a new seizure type, the patient was 
admitted for longterm continuous video EEG monitoring.

The patient was slowly tapered off of Lamictal. She had a few 
pushbuttons for body twitching that had no EEG correlate, 
however she did not have any of the typical dizzy spells. She 
also did not have any crying spells, which had been a prior 
seizure semiology for her. Her EEG showed rhythmic slowing with 
sharp features in the L hemisphere, but no frank epileptiform 
discharges or seizures. 
The patient was therefore restarted on her Lamictal at a reduced 
dose of 300mg BID. She was also started on Vimpat and titrated 
up to 100 mg BID by discharge. She will remain on his dose until 
follow up with Dr. ___ on ___. 

The patient was monitored on cardiac telemetry and remained in 
atrial fibrillation with no pauses, rapid rates, or other 
arrhythmias. She was continued on atenolol, digoxin and ASA.

2. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt 
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. 
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal for the patient's body 
size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are 
consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.

leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic 
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. 
7. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. 
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. Well-seated 
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. Mild residual

eval for pleural effusions 
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after aortic valve 
replacement, CABG and patent foramen ovale closure.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to ___.

Patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of 
the NG tube and Swan-Ganz catheter. The moderate cardiomegaly is 
stable. The bibasal opacities are consistent with post-surgical 
atelectasis, improved. Small amount of pleural effusion is 
demonstrated, bilateral. There is no evidence of failure. There 
is no pneumothorax.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for 
surgical management of her aortic valve and coronary artery 
disease. She was taken directly to the operating room where she 
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels, and 
aortic valve replacement with a 21mm ___ Porcine valve 
and a PFO closure. Please see operative note for details. 
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive 
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mrs. 
___ awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She 
awoke mildly confused but slowly cleared mentally. She was 
transfused with two units of packed red blood cells for 
postoperative anemia. Mrs. ___ developed atrial 
fibrillation for which amioadrone and coumadin was started. On 
postoperative day two, she was transferred to the step down unit 
for further recovery. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were 
resumed. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative 
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted to assist 
with her postoperative strength and mobility. She became 
confused and was pancultured given her WBC of 20. Her INR rose 
quickly to 3.6. Her confusion improved and her INR stabilized 
and she was ready for discharge home on POD #6.
