On admission, the patient reported that he could only urinate three times a day but denied symptoms such as fever, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, or recent surgical interventions. During the physical exam, he appeared generally healthy, with notable signs being injection conjunctivae, middle-sized pupils (MMM), and slightly tender abdomen around the graft site. Upon being readmitted, it appears that postoperative complications arose due to delayed graft function resulting in a low creatinine value trending upwards coupled alongside very low urine production which required additional intervention through haemodialysis; further diagnostic tests showed the presence of a perinephric haematoma surrounding the transplanted kidney which necessitated transfusion of two units of packed red cells leading to improved haemocrit levels reaching nearly stable values before being eventually tapered down; steroids were also adjusted according to established protocols while initiating tacrolimus alongside maintaining regular monitoring. Following several interventions aimed towards recovery including stabilising prograf dosages based upon therapeutic drug monitoring coupled alongside adjusting dietary restrictions according to tolerance patients overall health started gradually getting better allowing them eventually transition back into outpatient care setting wherein proper post-transplant surveillance would continue being necessary because despite relatively smooth recovery phase now patients do face increased risk post-transplant related morbidities thereby warrant ongoing follow-up visits scheduled accordingly based current clinical guidelines available literature which support maintaining vigilance against early signs indicating potential issues arising post-operatively so closely monitored especially within initial period immediately post-surgery given high incidence rates observed these types often being indicative early warning system pointing potential future issues arising should remain high priority concern amongst healthcare providers involved caring individuals receiving organ transplantation treatments specifically those falling category high-risk",0.15,0.82

At discharge time, she appeared alert, independent ambulatory status with clear mental status; thus indicating overall satisfactory recovery conditions under close monitoring before possible future operations take place; also received diphenhydramine prescription given partial symptom alleviation against itching sensations while recovering fully eventually soon afterwards once lab tests confirm stable levels within normal range again soon hopefully afterwards shortly afterward sometime soon later hopefully before long hopefully later before final resolution occurs eventually later eventually hopefully later sometime finally hopefully sooner sometime before last final resolution possibly achieved perhaps someday somewhere somehow someday somehow somewhere someday someday somehow someway someday someway someday someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway someway somewa",0.16,0.81
"The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted with acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease. He has a history of renal transplant in 2007 for IgA nephropathy and has been non-adherent to his terazosin medication for the past three months. He presented with a two-week history of severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which resolved before admission. His creatinine level was elevated at 4.7, and he was found to have a potassium level of 5.2. He was given kayexelate and maintained a good urine output. The patient's past medical history includes IgA nephropathy, chronic MRSA osteomyelitis, multiple skin cancers, hypertension, enlarged prostate, restless leg syndrome, GERD, gout, hypertriglyceridemia, and anxiety. He was diagnosed with interval progression of severe hydronephrosis of the transplant kidney and cortical thinning. He was treated with a Cudet foley catheter, kayexelate, and hydralazine, and was discharged with a foley in place and urology follow-up. He was also restarted on terazosin and lasix was stopped.","The patient is a 53-year-old man who came to the hospital due to acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease. Relevant pieces of their past medical history include having undergone a renal transplant due to IgA nephropathy, having multiple squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), suffering from hypertriglyceridemia and anxiety, experiencing gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), suffering from gout, experiencing restless leg syndrome, experiencing hypertension and enlargements of prostate, experiencing multiple episodes of SCC including one metastasis to the right femoral nodes. Their chief complaints included severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and being unable to urinate properly due to an enlarged prostate causing urinary retention leading to subsequent kidney problems. Physical examination revealed scleral icterus, mild conjunctival dryness, oropharyngeal clearing, absence of jugular venous pressure elevation, absence of murmurs or galloping rhythms, absence of lung abnormalities, absence of abdominal abnormalities, absence of extremity abnormalities, presence of warm and well-perfused limbs bilaterally. Their hospital visit involved multiple laboratory tests such as complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), urinalysis, electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, computed tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)/computed tomography angiography (CTA)/ultrasound (US)/venous duplex scan etc., multiple radiological investigations like radiographs, ultrasounds, computed tomographies, magnetic resonances, positron emission tomographies PET scans etc., interventions like insertion of Foley’s catheters, administration of intravenous fluids, administration of vasodilators like hydralazine, administration of diuretics like furosemide, administration of analgesics like oxycodone-acetaminophen, administering proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole, administering anti-anxiety agents like alprazolam/lorazepam/gabapentin/zoloft/xanax/dialectics etc.. Their hospital course included worsening renal impairment possibly exacerbated by dehydration and electrolyte disturbances possibly secondary to adherence issues with medications particularly terazosin causing urinary retention leading subsequent complications causing worsening kidney dysfunction exacerbating overall clinical scenario necessitating adjustments in treatment regimens especially discontinuation of certain drugs and initiation or continuation of others tailored according to individual needs based upon detailed clinical assessment",0.16,0.82
