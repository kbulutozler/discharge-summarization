He also developed a left basilic vein thrombosis and had episodes of intermittent hyponatremia, which were treated with salt tablets.

The patient's past medical history includes diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, cataract surgery, and a non-traumatic retinal detachment. He has allergies to penicillins and Vicodin.

The patient's diagnosis is a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and he underwent a cerebral angiogram to rule out an aneurysm. He was treated with dilantin and later switched to Keppra due to side effects.

The patient underwent a brief hospital course, during which he was monitored for any complications. He was started on a course of dilantin, but due to side effects, he was switched to Keppra. He also developed a left basilic vein thrombosis and had episodes of intermittent hyponatremia, which were treated with salt tablets.

The patient's medications at discharge include nimodipine, docusate sodium, senna, oxycodone-acetaminophen, levetiracetam, and simvastatin.","Age and gender of the patient are 75 years and Male respectively, presenting to the emergency room due to severe headache, likely resulting from sudden onset subarachnoid hemorrhage. Their past medical history includes diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and previous surgeries including cataracts removal and repair of right non-traumatic retinal detachment. Their chief complaints included severe headache and subsequent nausea/vomiting; upon physical examination, they were found awake and alert, oriented to person, place, and date, with normal language function and cranial nerve II being fully functional. During their stay, the patient underwent cerebral angiography showing no signs of aneurysms.    They required switching between Dilantin due to its side effects causing a skin rash, eventually switching to Kepra due to Dilantin side effects, with further complications arising such as intermittent hyponatremia requiring treatment and another episode of left basilic vein thrombosis, however remaining stable otherwise.     Patient should carefully monitor vital signs especially when experiencing increased frequency of bowel movement side effect using docusate or sennas concurrently prescribed alongside oxycodone-acetaminophen combination for managing chronic post-surgical headaches and manage daily activities cautiously while under treatment regimen consisting primarily levetiracetam alongside other necessary supplements such as multivitamin supplement simvastatin, glyburide alongside monitoring electrolyte balance using sodium chloride pills taken thrice daily.     They will receive necessary follow-up appointments and should immediately contact healthcare provider upon observing significant deviations like worsened neurological functions like dizziness etc., alongside being vigilant against infections.     They will be kept under close observation post-discharge given overall health assessment classified ‘good’ based primarily on current medical records available indicating relatively smooth recovery progress observed over duration spent within healthcare facility premises – thus emphasizing importance adherence maintained strict adherence toward prescribed post-hospital treatments regimens assigned specifically tailored suit best suit specific needs unique requirements presenting patients cases highlighting potential risks encountered complications associated future health-related concerns ongoing careful monitoring required ensuring complete safety return back original optimal functioning state desired restored promptly – hence making overall clinical disposition categorized ‘good’.",0.18,0.62
