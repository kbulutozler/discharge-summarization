History of Present Illness:
___ yo G5P2 morbid obesity, OSA, asthma, hypertension, chronic 
lymphedema, and history of prior ectopic pregnancy with recent 
hospitalization for LLE cellulitis and pneumonia (completed OPAT 
vanc/cef 10 days ago) who presented to the ED for increased 
dyspnea, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, and GU bleeding.

Patient reports she began having her perior around ___ and 
has had intmittent passing of clots (liver like material). She 
notes on some days her pad was soaked with dark blood and other 
days she had minimal bleeding. She is only changing 1 pad/day. 
She notes intense abdominal cramping with clot passage. She has 
had no lower GI bleeding that she knows of and notes 
constipation and brown stool. She has been taking iron. she 
denies BRBPR or streaks of blood on stool. She has has had pea 
sized hemoptysis x 2 days.
Has been on 4L NC at home since prior discharge, felt more SOB, 
DOE, weak/light headed with changing position which prompted her 
to come to ED. 

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.4 88 169/81 20 100% 15L. 
Labs were notable for WBC 9.6 H/H ___ MCV 68 which is her 
baseline, bicarb 33 at baseline, HCG ___, Ddimer 1838. CXR 
showed worsening RML adn RLL infiltrate, left pleural effusion, 
and concern for Wegeners. ___ limited study that was 
negative, VQ scan with abnormalities cannot exclude PE. Pelvic 
ultrasound limited, no abd free fluid. OBGYN was consulted in ED 
and felt this was not an ectopic pregnancy. She continued to 
require noninvasive respiratory support. She received duonebs, 
lasix 80 mg, vanc/cefepme/azithro. Her abd pain improved and she 
was transferred to the FICU.

Urine Legionella Ag (___): Negative
C Diff (___): Negative

REPORTS:
========

EKG (___): Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse low voltage. Wandering 
baseline and baseline artifact. Compared to the previous tracing 
of ___ no apparent diagnostic interim change.

CXR (___): 
1. Worsening rounded opacities in the right lung worrisome for 
multifocal
pneumonia possibly from septic emboli. Wegener's should also be 
considered. 
2. Moderate cardiomegaly and likely a background of mild 
pulmonary edema.

VQ SCAN (___):
This examination is markedly limited due to patient body habitus 
and inability to position.  Several round matched perfusion and 
ventilation defects are present in the right lung and a few 
matched defects are present in the left lung.  These defects 
correspond to areas of opacity seen on the abnormal chest 
radiograph.
 
IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited exam.  Several bilateral matched 
ventilation/perfusion/radiograph abnormalities.  Pulmonary 
embolism cannot be excluded but the shape of the defects is not 
suggestive of pulmonary embolism.

___ DOPPLER STUDY (___):
1.  Severely limited study by body habitus.  No definite 
thrombus is
visualized.  The calf veins cannot be visualized.
2.  Subcutaneous edema in both calves.

PELVIC ULTRASOUND (___):
1. Extremely limited exam due to patient body habitus.  No 
evidence of free fluid.  The adnexa were not visualized on this 
exam.
These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ 
in person at 6 p.m. on the day of the exam, and an MRI was 
recommended for further evaluation.
2. Fibroid uterus.

D+C PATHOLOGY (___):
1. Endometrium, curettage:
- Highly atypical trophoblastic proliferation morphologically 
consistent with choriocarcinoma.
- No chorionic villi or fetal parts identified.

BAL CYTOLOGY (___):
Positive for malignant cells.

LIVER/GALLBLADDER U/S (___):
Sludge filled gallbladder without wall thickening or 
pericholecystic fluid to suggest acute cholecystitis, though it 
can not be completely excluded. No intra or extrahepatic biliary 
duct dilation. 
Mildly echogenic liver is likely from mild fatty deposition, 
however other diffuse liver disease cannot be excluded.. 

REPEAT CXR (___):
Combination of masses and consolidation most severe throughout 
the right lung and in the left lower lung unchanged for several 
days. Heart is enlarged, probably severely, not appreciably 
changed.  Pleural effusions cannot be excluded but are not 
large. No pneumothorax. 

NECK U/S (___):
Limited exam shows no mass anterior to the trachea.

RENAL ___:
1. No evidence of perinephric abscess or hydronephrosis 
involving the right kidney. 
2. The left kidney is not visualized. 

VEIN MAPPING (___):
IMPRESSION: 
Patent bilateral subclavian, cephalic and basilic veins with 
measurements as above. Patent bilateral radial and brachial 
arteries. No evidence of
calcifications. 

TTE ___ IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic 
function. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. No definite valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified.

___ CT HEAD IMPRESSION:  A small enhancing lesion measuring 8 
x 5 mm, in the left cerebellomedullary region -?  Related to 
adjacent left vertebral artery or an enhancing mass lesion. 
Dedicated MRI if not contra-indicated may be considered for 
further characterization. 
Another focus of punctate enhancement best visualized on series 
7, image 54 and series 4, image 26- ?  End-on appearance of 
vessel or a tiny lesion. 

___ CT ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION:  
1. Exam is severely limited by body habitus.  No gross findings 
to suggest distant metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis. 
2. Ill-characterized 5.4 cm hypodense lesion in the left adnexa 
with dense rim.  There is lack of clear fat planes with the 
uterus and this may represent either a primary uterine lesion or 
possibly invasion of an adnexal lesion into the uterus.  No 
prior imaging for comparison and this may represent the primary 
lesion. Consider pelvic ultrasound for further evaluation.  
Though the study will be limited by body habitus, this lesion is 
in location which should 
be amenable to transvaginal visualization. 
3. Rectus diastases with suggestion of a fat containing anterior 
abdominal wall hernia though this is not imaged. 
4. Large fat containing low ventral hernia. 

CT CHEST ___: IMPRESSION: Very limited examination.  Soft 
tissue density pulmonary nodules in all lobes of the lungs, with 
maximum diameters of approximately 16 mm.  No pleural effusions. 
 No airway lesions.  No lymphadenopathy. 

MRI HEAD w contrast ___:
1. Motion limited exam without evidence for intracranial 
metastatic disease.
2. 6 mm fusiform dilatation of the distal left vertebral artery, 
which
corresponds to the abnormality on the preceding head CT.
3. Numerous foci of chronic blood products in bilateral cerebral 
hemispheres
and right cerebellar hemisphere. A lesion in the right temporal 
lobe
demonstrates high signal on T1 weighted images, compatible with 
a cavernous
malformation.  The others are compatible with indeterminate 
chronic micro
hemorrhages, possibly hypertensive, or multiple cavernous 
malformations.
4. Multiple foci of high T2 signal in the supratentorial white 
matter are
nonspecific but compatible with sequela of chronic ischemic 
disease, given the
history of hypertension and renal impairment.
 
___ Trans vaginal ultrasound: 
1.  4.9 x 5.4 x 4.7 cm lesion left of the uterus, also seen on 
the ___ CT, demonstrates ultrasound characteristics most compatible 
with an
exophytic fibroid.  The appearance of bulk fat seen on the CT, 
which is not
appreciated on this examination, can be explained by severe beam 
hardening
artifact, which can substantially distort density measurements.
2.  The ovaries are not visualized

chronic lymphedema, and history of prior ectopic pregnancy with 
recent hospitalization for LLE cellulitis and pneumonia who 
presented to the ED for increased dyspnea, hemoptysis, abdominal 
pain found to have metastatic choriocarcinoma. She was started 
on EMACO chemotherapy, but her hospital course lasted >6 months 
and was comoplicated by VAP/bacteremia, fungemia, and acute 
renal failure requiring HD. She ultimately recovered and 
completed 8 cycles of EMA/CO (with methotrexate removed because 
of toxicity). Her B-hcg, which was initially >100,000, fell to 
<5. At time of discharge, she has multiple nodules seen on 
imaging, which may or may not represent metastatic foci of 
disease. Some of these nodules were not confirmed on more 
sensitive imaging. Others were not felt to be amenable to biopsy 
given her body habitus. She is being discharged to rehab with 
plans to return for her ninth cycle of E(M)ACO.

 
ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Choriocarcinoma: Patient initially presented with abdominal 
pain, SOB, and intermittent irregular vaginal bleeding during 
the prior 3 weeks, with increasing O2 requirements and 
hemoptysis. In the ED, she was noted to have an hCG > 160,000. 
Due to body habitus, vaginal US was inconclusive and could not 
r/o IUP; her habitus also prevented CT and MRI scanning. Repeat 
CXRs revealed interval growth of nodular masses new in ___, compared to films from ___ of this year. In the setting 
of hemoptysis, vaginal bleeding, and HCG ___, there was 
strong suspicion of choriocarcinoma with lung metastasis. She 
was intubated for operative vaginal US and D+C; pathologic 
specimens from that procedure revealed choriocarcinoma. Oncology 
was consulted, and treatment begun with EMA/CO regimen 
(etoposide, MTX, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
leucovorin calcium). Given ___ as below, MTX was held in initial 
cycle. During hospitalization, patient developed multiple 
different infections including candidemia, vent-associated 
pneumonia, and bacteremia, and chemotherapy was given between 
these different infections, and continued once infections had 
resolved. Her chemotherapy course often had to be interrupted in 
the setting of complications (see below). In early ___ EMACO 
treatment began again.
          Methotrexate given on ___ caused significant 
toxicity causing mucositis and herpetic lesions in gluteal area 
and lower back, leukopenia requiring broad antibiotic coverage. 
New PICC line placed ___. Patient improved and 
antibiotics were slowly peeled off. It was decided no more 
Methotrexate would be given with the EMACO treatment. Her HCG 
levels were trended weekly, and improved from >160,000 to 
undetectable on ___. She then completed two further cycles 
of EMA/CO (with methotrexate removed due to toxicity). Staging 
imaging could not be performed initially due to pt's obesity, 
but she finally had CTs of chest, abd/pelvis, and head in late 
___, showing bilateral pulmonary nodules, two possible 
brain lesions, and an adnexal vs uterine mass. Significance of 
these findings unclear, since it would be unlikley for her to 
have such widely metastatic residual disease with an 
undetectable hCG.  Further evaluation was as follows: The brain 
mass was not confirmed on repeat MRI with contrast. A 
trans-vaginal ultrasound was performed which showed that mass 
seen on CT of the abd/pelvis was arising within the uterus and 
had imaging characteristics consistent with a fibroid. ___ was 
consulted regarding the lung nodules and felt that the 
likelihood of a diagnostic biopsy was low and the risk of 
procedural complications was high. Therefore no biopsy of the 
lung nodules was attempted. She is being discharged to rehab 
with plans to return to the hospital for her ___ cycle of 
E(M)ACO.

#Vaginal Bleeding: The patient was transferred back to the FICU 
on ___ after having profuse vaginal bleeding soaking through 
multiple towels prior to transfer. The patient had recently 
received chemo and it was thought that this bleeding was likely 
___ hemorrhagic conversion of her tumors. ___ was consulted but 
were unable to intervene as they were limited by the patient's 
size. They also would be unable to perform an adequate 
intervention without knowing the precise location of the bleed. 
OB was paged and packed the vagina with gauze after clearing out 
clot from the vagina. The patient transiently was placed on 
pressors for hypotension during this episode. During her stay in 
the FICU, the patient remained HD stable. Radiation oncology was 
consulted but after discussions with their Physics and 
Engineering staff it was not technically or safely possible to 
treat the patient with radiotherapy given her weight. She 
required intermittent RBC transfusions for slowly downtrending 
H/H possibly due to slow vaginal bleeding vs. marrow suppression 
from chemotherapy. She had no further episodes of large vaginal 
bleeding during FICU course, and was transferred back to the 
oncology service. . 
 
# Respiratory Failure: After the D+C, patient was kept intubated 
out of concern for increasing hemoptysis with treatment. She 
self extubated on ___, but became hypoxic and had to be 
re-intubated. She continued on CMV ventilation and was 
eventually weaned to pressure support on ___. However, she was 
very difficult to get off of the ventilator likely due to a 
combination of her obese body habitus and metastatic lung 
disease burden. Given the need for prolonged ventilator support, 
ENT surgery took patient for tracheostomy placement on ___. 
After this time, numerous attempts were made to wean her 
sedation and to wean her ventilatory support requirements, but 
due to her increased agitation as well as her acidemia from 
renal failure, she was difficult to wean from the ventilator. On 
___, she was found to have a ventilator-associated pneumonia 
with fevers, leukocytosis, and positive sputum cultures with 
pseudomonas and two strains of E. coli. She was tx for an 8-day 
course of meropenem. With her renal failure, she was extremely 
volume overloaded from initial aggressive fluid resuscitation so 
was placed on CRRH and eventually HD on ___. When her 
infections were treated, her blood pressures improved, and we 
were able to remove large amounts of fluid with HD. After 
removal of fluid, treatment of VAP, and with continued 
chemotherapy to treat lung mets, the patient was able to be 
weaned off of the ventilator onto trach collar on ___, and her 
respiratory status has been stable. Per ENT, the patient needed 
a long 100-120 mm uncuffed long trach in order to undergo a 
successful capping trial to be considered for decannulation. 
This device was ordered on ___. Since then, the patient has had 
recent episodes of mucous plugging, requiring Mucomyst and 
saline nebs but was satting fine. Eventually patient was 
tolerating breathing through trach on RA, and after successful 
capping trial, had tracheostomy tube removed ___.

# Ventilator-associated pneumonia/Pseudomonal bacteremia: Due to 
continued leukocytosis and fever, cultures were obtained and 
sputum cx from ___ was positive for pseudomonas and two 
strains of E. coli thought to be secondary to a vent-associated 
pneumonia. Pseudomonas had intermediate sensitivity to ___, 
however E. coli sensitive, so treated for an 8-day course or 
meropenem with resolution of fevers for 4 days. On ___, patient 
spiked a low grade temp, and she was recultured. Blood cultures 
grew pseudomonas. Her IJ was removed in the setting of 
bacteremia, and 48-hours after a PICC was placed. Patient was 
initially started on Zosyn, but due to sensitivities, she was 
started on ceftazidime for a 14-day course, dosed with HD, which 
the patient completed on ___. On ___ the patient had an epsiode 
of rigors, tachypnea, and sustained tachycardia in 130s. She was 
never febrile but had just finished HD. A prior sputum culture 
had grown pseudomonas so she was empirically covered with vanc, 
cipro, and tobramycin due to sensitivities. On ___ one bottle of 
blood culture grew Pseudomonas. Patient was treated with a 14 
day course of ciprofloxacin and tobramycin given sensitivities. 
LIJ tunneled HD line from which culture was drawn was removed on 
___, with RIJ triple lumen exchanged for temp HD line with VIP. 
Given concern for infection RIJ removed (___) given no 
need for HD. With new fevers in ___, She was 
broadly covered initially with Vanc / Meropenem / Acyclovir / 
Micafungin, given multiple possible sources: mucositis, Right 
foot base ulcer, bleeding ulcers in back, UTI.

# Acute tubular necrosis: Pt had 700 cc blood loss following D+C 
noted above; she became relatively hypotensive and experienced a 
falling hematocrit. Despite resuscutation with blood and 
crystalloids, her Cr continued to rise and she became massively 
volume overloaded. She was dialysed and eventually placed on 
CRRT. She had persistent issues with the CRRT filters clotting, 
as she was not anticoagulated, and transitioned to HD on ___. 
Her nephrology team anticipated a likely prolonged requirement 
for HD given the lack of response or recovery of her kidney 
function. Given this need, they requested that at tunneled line 
be placed by ___ however, on ___, her blood cultures grew 
___ (see below for more details), so the tunneled line was 
deferred. Following a 14-week course of fluconazole for 
fungemia, ___ successfully placed a permanent tunneled left IJ on 
___. Eventually the HD line clotted off, so on ___, ___ 
changed the line with an over-the-wire placement. The patient 
was evaluate by transplant surgery on ___ given difficulty with 
the tunneled line on ___. The patient received vein mapping on 
___ to evaluate for placement of Herograft for permanent 
dialysis access but subsequently successfully received dialysis 
on ___, so the need for permanent access was deferred. She 
continued on HD on a ___ schedule. Patient however began to 
produce urine, with creatinine downtrending, and HD was held 
(after consulting with renal) as of ___. For rest of hospital 
course patient did not require hemodialysis. Her new baseline Cr 
after this was approximately 1.4-1.6.

# Candidemia: Culture taken on ___ from her R PICC grew 
___. Culture taken on ___ from her L HD line eventually 
grew ___ as well. She was started on micafungin on ___. ID 
was consulted and recommended removing R PICC and culturing tip, 
removing L IJ HD line, ophtho exam, TEE, and ultrasound to 
evaluate for fungal peritonitis. The ultrasound showed no 
obvious ascites. Beta-d-glucan was negative. Ophtho evaluation 
showed no fungal endophthalmitis or papilledema but did show 
peripapillary hemorrhages, nonspecific finding. TEE showed no 
vegetations and normal cardiac function. Cultures speciated 
___ albicans, so her micafungin was switched to fluconazole 
per ID recommendations to complete a 14-day course. Micafungin 
was again started in ___ due to concern for infection though 
no source was found. This was subsequently discontinued.

# Hypercalcemia: Noted to have increasing calcium, trending up 
since ___, with normal albumin, and elevated PTH to 244. Thought 
to be secondary to tertiary hyperparathyroidism from ESRD and 
prolonged immobility. It was difficult to give IVF given HD 
dependence, and concern for fluid overload, so she was evaluated 
by Renal and started on sevalamer. She also was dialyzed with 
low calcium bath with HD, with improvement in hypercalcemia. Per 
renal, cinacalcet initiated ___. She was planned for U/S to 
evaluate for parathyroid adenoma ___ but per radiology, a 
Sestamibi scan would be a superior study. However due to body 
habitus, this would be difficult to coordinate. The decision was 
to keep the patient on sevalamer and cincalcet for the time 
being, which has been appropriately controlling Ca levels. 
Eventually given patient's well controlled calcium levels 
cinalcet was discontinued. 

# Sepsis ___ ESBL E Coli UTI: Patient developed low grade fevers 
on morning of ___ and became tachycardic and hypotensive, 
requiring initiation of norepinephrine for blood pressure 
support. She was pan-cultured with CXR and started on empiric IV 
vancomycin and meropenem for neutropenic coverage. Her urine 
cultures grew ESBL, and no growth in blood cultures, so was 
treated with a 7 day course of meropenem and vancomycin. While 
on the OMED service, hospital course was complicated by fevers 
as above (#Respiratory failure) and patient was treated with 
Vanc/Meropenem/Micafungin/Acyclovir given multiple sources of 
infection in ___ through ___. No source was found.

#Anemia: Patient required numerous blood transfusion during her 
hospital stay to maintain her Hb>7. Transfusion requirement was 
thought to be ___ marrow toxicity from her EMACO chemotherapy.

#Nutrition: She had some issues tolerating her tube feeds, and 
on ___ was started on methylnaloxone and reglan, with good 
response in terms of bowel movements. She was continued on a prn 
bowel regimen to ensure appropriate bowel movement frequency in 
an effort to avoid GI backup and tube feed residuals. On ___ 
she had evaluation by speech & swallow, and cleared for pureed 
liquids only. On the floor, had several episodes of a displaced 
NGT, which was not replaced on ___. In the FICU, she passed 
speech and swallow eval and her diet was advanced. On the 
oncology service, patient intially had a low potassium, low 
phosphate diet per ATN (see above). She had trouble with PO 
intake after mucositis due to methotrexate on ___. But as 
she recovered she was able to tolerate POs and a completely 
normal diet by the time of discharge.
    Her weight fluctuated massively while in the hospital. She 
reached as high as 681 lbs while fluid overloaded and was 
discharged at a weight of around 500 lbs. Her albumin was 3.4 at 
time of discharge.

# Elevated LFTs: On ___, started to have increasing LFTs which 
stabilized with AST 150s, ALT 200s, and AP 100s. No elevation of 
Tbili to suggest obstruction. Unclear if due to medication side 
effect (quetiapine, Zyprexa, ceftaz, chemo) or other cause, 
however with no abdominal pain on exam, her LFTs were trended 
throughout stay. RUQ ultrasound from ___ with sludge, but no 
evidence of cholelithiasis. The patient's LFTs continued to 
downtrend. She again experienced mild transaminitis peaking at 
100s in ___ in the setting of fluconazole use. Her med list 
was pared down and her transaminitis cleared.

# HTN: During her prolonged hospital stay, home 
antihypertensives were periodically held in the setting of 
sepsis. While on OMED service, Labetalol was increased to 200mg 
TID given elevated pressures and this regimen worked well for 
patient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# Microcytic anemia: Patient has a history of microcytic anemia 
at baseline, usually in the low ___. On iron supplementation, 
but this was held in the setting of abdominal pain. Patient 
received a number of transfusions during her hospitalization. 
She seemed to be transfusion dependent and received a unit of 
blood almost every day or other day.

# Hyperactive bladder: Oxybutinin was held as foley remained in 
place while patient was intubated and sedated. The patient 
continued to have a foley in place throughout her FICU stay and 
the start of her OMEd stay. Foley was changed a number of times 
throughout her hospital stay.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
-return ___ from cycle 9 EACO
-Hb check twice weekly at rehab, txfuse 1 u pRBC for Hb<7.
-her home antihypertensive regimen (previously on lasix, lower 
dose labetolol, and lisinopril) was pared down at time of 
discharge with ___ improved blood pressure control. Now only on 
labetalol 200 mg TID.
-She has a cracked crown in one of her R molars. Once stabilized 
from her choriocancer, she will need a dental and/or OMFS 
evaluation.

NOTIFICATION:  The emergent finding of GI bleeding was reviewed 
in person with Dr. ___. The final impression was 
discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on 
___ at 5:29 ___, 20 minutes after discovery of the 
findings. 

EEG ___
CONTINUOUS EEG: The background activity varied between what 
appeared to be a significant encephalopathic EEG to one that 
appeared to be associated with persistent stage N2 to N3 sleep. 
During the encephalopathic portion of this record, there is very 
little posterior background rhythm. There is continuous high 
amplitude polymorphic ___ Hz delta activity seen with frontal 
and central predominance admixed with faster theta frequency 
activity over the central regions. During the sleep portion of 
the record, the background is still suppressed posteriorly; 
however, well-formed vertex waves and evolving stage N2 and 3 
sleep was noted. 
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were numerous automated spike 
detections 
predominantly for the vertex related activity. No clear 
interictal Epileptic discharges were identified. 
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no automated seizure 
detections. 
QUANTITATIVE EEG: Trend analysis was performed with Persyst 
Magic Marker 
software. Panels included automated seizure detection, rhythmic 
run detection and display, color spectral density array, 
absolute and relative asymmetry indices, asymmetry spectrogram, 
amplitude integrated EEG, burst suppression ratio, envelope 
trend, and alpha delta ratios. Segments showing abnormal trends 
were reviewed and showed diffuse symmetric encephalopathic 
changes. 
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations. 
SLEEP: See above. 
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an 
average rate of 100-115 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of a moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy with 
attenuation of background frequencies in the presence of high 
amplitude delta activity. However, during portions of the 
record, a relatively normal sequencing of sleep was seen. This 
can happen and may reflect excessive drowsiness in the presence 
of a more mild to moderate encephalopathy. There were no 
lateralized, localized, or epileptic features to the record. 

___ CXR IMPRESSION:  
IN COMPARISON WITH THE STUDY ___, THERE AGAIN ARE LOW 
LUNG VOLUMES.  MONITORING AND SUPPORT DEVICES ARE WITHIN NORMAL 
LIMITS. THERE IS INCREASING BILATERAL OPACIFICATIONS.  ALTHOUGH 
SOME OF THIS MAY MERELY REFLECT CROWDING OF VESSELS AND 
PULMONARY EDEMA, THE POSSIBILITY OF SUPERIMPOSED PNEUMONIA. 
WOULD HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED IN THE APPROPRIATE 
CLINICAL SETTING. 
  
___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
1. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are consistent with 
aspiration in the setting of massive upper GI bleed. 
2. Monitoring and support devices are in the appropriate 
positions. 

ABD DUPLEX U/S
FINDINGS:    
There is a large amount of echogenic ascites with more organized 
thrombus 
around the liver.  Although is difficult to accurately 
quantitate the amount of hemorrhage, the ascites appears 
increased compared to CT of 2 days ago. 
  
The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The TIPS 
is patent and demonstrates wall-to-wall flow with velocities of 
83, 120, and 120 cm/sec in the proximal, mid, and distal 
portions respectively. 
  
MPV is patent with velocity of 29 cm/sec.  The left portal vein 
is not 
visualized.  Flow within the right anterior portal vein is 
reversed. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Hemoperitoneum with more organized thrombus around the 
liver. Although it is difficult to accurately quantitate, the 
amount of ascites appears larger than on the CT of 2 days ago 
2.   Patent TIPS. 

___ CT-A A/P
FINDINGS:  The bases of the lungs demonstrate significant 
atelectasis and 
small bilateral pleural effusions.  Superimposed infectious 
process of the consolidations cannot be excluded. 
  
The patient is status post TIPS with the TIPS stent seen in 
appropriate 
position.  The liver is diffusely heterogeneous with a nodular 
contour and regenerative nodules consistent with cirrhosis.  No 
definite arterially enhancing hepatic lesion is identified.  The 
gallbladder is hyperdense, consistent with excretion of 
contrast.  Redemonstrated is a wedge-shaped area of 
hypoenhancement in the upper pole of the spleen, consistent with 
a splenic infarction, unchanged compared to the prior exam.  The 
pancreas is normal without evidence of focal lesions or 
pancreatic duct dilatation. 
  
The adrenal glands bilaterally are normal.  The kidneys 
bilaterally are normal without evidence of focal solid or cystic 
lesions concerning for malignancy.  
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. 
  
There is a large amount of hemoperitoneum.  On the arterial 
phase, there is a serpiginous structure anterior to the right 
liver which is likely a 
subcapsular vessel which itself is distended secondary to a 
subcapsular 
hematoma.  The terminus of the vessel is irregular on the portal 
venous 
phases.  Active extravasation in this region cannot be excluded. 
 Hyperdense blood is also seen immediately inferior to the 
liver. 
  
Evaluation of the gastroesophageal junction is limited due to 
the embolization particles; however, the stomach is distended 
with hyperdense material concerning for hemorrhage.  
Intraluminal areas of increased density within the small and 
large bowel are also concerning for hemorrhage.  There is no 
evidence of wall thickening or obstruction. 
  
Areas of irregularity within the liver are likely secondary to 
lacerations from the recent TIPS procedure.  There is no 
intra-abdominal free air.  The right common femoral catheter is 
redemonstrated. 
  
CT PELVIS:  The urinary bladder demonstrates a Foley catheter.  
The uterus appears unremarkable. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for 
malignancy are identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Massive Hemoperitoneum with irregularity of a distended 
subcapsular vessel in both the arterial and portal venous phases 
is concerning for active extravasation.  High-density blood is 
seen immediately inferior to the liver. 
2.  Although evaluation of the gastroesophageal junction is 
limited by embolic particles from recent embolization, there is 
evidence of hemorrhage within a distended stomach and remainder 
of the small and large bowel loops.  Active extravasation from 
the gastroesophageal junction cannot be excluded. 
3.  Irregularity of the liver with evidence of lacerations is 
likely from 
recent TIPS procedure. 
4.  Small foci of pneumoperitoneum are likely secondary to the 
recent 
intervention. 
5.  Diffuse anasarca throughout the body. 

___ MRA NECK W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1.       No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2.       Chronic right cerebellar hemispheric infarction, 
unusual in a patient of this age; correlate with more detailed 
clinical information. 
3.       No evidence of hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical 
dysplasia, gray matter heterotopia or other anatomic substrate 
for seizure 
4.       Normal cranial MRA. 
5.       Large amount of fluid within the mastoid air cells and 
sphenoid air cells. While likely related to prolonged 
intubation, this process has 
progressed considerably since ___, and should be correlated 
clinically. 

___ ABDOMEN US
FINDINGS:  
Limited abdominal ultrasound again demonstrates ascites with 
echogenic 
material consistent with thrombus.  There is a large amount of 
echogenic, 
apparently organized thrombus in the lower quadrants.  The 
quantity of 
anechoic, drainable appearing fluid, is small, however.  A 
paracentesis could be performed, but large volume fluid removal 
is not expected to be achieved. 
IMPRESSION:  
Findings again consistent with hemoperitoneum and ascites with 
large amount of echogenic clot within the abdomen with smaller 
quantity of drainable-appearing free fluid. 

___ LIVER ABD US
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  Ascites and 
hemoperitoneum again seen. 
2.  Patent TIPS with velocities similar to ___.      
3.  Hyperechoic lesion in the liver in segment VIII.  MR can be 
done for 
further evaluation when indicated.  

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
Right PICC line tip is deep in the right atrium.  , might be 
pulled back 
approximately 2 cm. TIPS and most likely coils of embolization 
of ___ is are unchanged in appearance. Heart size and 
mediastinum are unchanged as well as bilateral basal 
consolidations.  No definitive evidence of interval development 
of pulmonary edema is present. The right need opacity is 
substantial and might reflect infectious process versus 
atelectasis 

___ CT ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Slight interval decrease in large volume pneumoperitoneum.  
In the absence of IV contrast, cannot assess for superinfection 
or abscess formation. 
2. TIPS in adequate position. 
3.  Anasarca. 
4.  Gallstones. 

___ CT CHEST
IMPRESSION:  
Moderate cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema and 
bilateral pleural 
effusions.  Multifocal pneumonia. 

___ RENAL US
IMPRESSION: 
1. No hydronephrosis. Unremarkable appearance of the kidneys. 
2. Ascites and hemoperitoneum is again noted. 

___ CXR
The tip of the endotracheal tube is 2.6 cm above the carina.  
There is a 
feeding tube with tip and side port in the stomach.  There is a 
right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the right atrium.  
This could be pulled back, 3-4 cm for more optimal placement.  
There are very low lung volumes with atelectasis versus 
developing infiltrates at the lung bases.  There are no 
pneumothoraces.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=======================
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o lady with history of alcohol 
abuse who initially presented with coagulopathy, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, muscosal bleeding, new onset seizure, 
hypotension s/p cardiac arrest with associated respiratory 
failure. She was found to have a large GE junction variceal 
bleed which was stopped with emolization of gastric artery, 
subsequent TIPS. TIPS was complicated by subsequent hepatic 
artery bleed, which caused severe abdominal compartment syndrome 
requiring repeat ___ intervention with embolization of 2 branches 
of hepatic artery.  She was ultimately transitioned to the ICU 
requiring intubation for pending respiratory failure in the 
setting of worsening liver failure (MELD 56), hepatorenal 
syndrome, anasarca, sepsis, and ongoing bleeding.  She was 
eventually made CMO by her family and expired shortly after 
terminal extubation.

# Massive variceal bleed complicated by hepatic arterial bleed - 
Pt presented with massive bleeding from all mucosal surfaces on 
presentation.  Her lower and upper GI tracts prompted an upper 
endoscopy which showed a massive esophageal bleed.  A stat CTA 
showed active extravasation from the GE junction, and she then 
proceeded to ___ for embolization of the gastric artery.  After 
the procedure, she continued to have significant bleeding with 
unstable blood counts and hemodynamics.  She was then referred 
for urgent TIPS procedure which proceeded without complication.  
However, over the next ___ hours her abdomen became massively 
distended and was sent down for a repeat CTA which confirmed 
massive hemoperitoneum as well as probable bleed from the liver. 
 She then went to ___ for a third procedure where they embolized 
2 branches of the hepatic artery.  They also attempted 
paracentesis but did not get substantial drainage has she was 
thought to be clotting off.  However, they did place an ostomy 
bag over the area.  Fortunately, after this final procedure, the 
patient stopped bleeding and was able to continue without blood 
products.  During this course, she received over 29 units of 
blood (massive transfusion protocol utilized), multiple units of 
FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitate.  The family was informed on 
multiple occasions of her poor prognosis.  She was later 
transitioned to CMO with terminal extubation per discussion with 
her family after her liver function worsened and was complicated 
by HRS.  

# Elevated transaminases with direct hyperbilirubinemia: 
Patient's LFTs started climbing on HD 4 after her bleeding 
stopped.  A RUS was obtained which showed TIPS is patent and no 
dilatation.  Transaminitis and elevated hyperbilirubinemia was 
thought to be due to cholestasis of sepsis versus EtOH 
hepatitis. MELD score elevated to the ___.

#Abdominal Compartment Syndrome- Patient's bladder pressure 
rose, peak pressures rose, and O2 sats declined along with 
massive abdominal distention in the setting of her hemorrhagic 
ascites when she bled from her hepatic artery.  She was taken 
for hepatic artery embolization as described above.  Multiple 
attempts at paracentesis did not yield fluid.  She had repeat 
abdominal ultrasounds that confirmed large amounts of clot in 
the peritoneum.  She developed oliguric renal failure not 
responsive to diuresis.

#Acute Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory Failure: Intubated 
in the setting of new seizure for airway protection.  She 
appeared to have aspirated blood given BRB out of ET tube.  Her 
ventilator settings were quite minimal until she developed 
worsening mechanics ___ abdominal compartment syndrome on ___ 
necessitating increasing O2 requirement and hypercarbia.  After 
the compartment syndrome resolved, she was easily extubated.  
However, the patient was again intubated for metabolic acidosis 
and altered mental status (likely hepatic encephalopathy).  Upon 
discussion with her family regarding her poor prognosis, she was 
terminally extubated after being transitioned to CMO.  She 
expired shortly after extubation. 

# Septic and hypovolemic shock s/p PEA arrest. (Resolved). Echo 
did not show cardiogenic component.  She was on pressors for the 
first few days for which she had a trauma line placed in R IJ.  
Most of the shock was likely hypovolemic from massive bleeding, 
although she did grow MSSA from her sputum as above.  Pressors 
were d/c on ___.  She was initially treated with 
vanc/cefepime/acyclovir and also received a dose of doxycycline 
and clindamycin early on (empiric coverage for tick born disease 
and toxic shock syndrome).  She was eventually narrowed down to 
just cefepime when meningitis was thought to be less likely.  
Blood cultures were ngtd. She later developed significant 
diarrhea, and although her C. diff was negative, she was treated 
with PO vanc/flagyl for presumed C. diff infection.   

#Hepatorenal syndrome: Spun urine is mostly bland, few casts, 1 
muddy brown cast c/w ATN.  Improved with hemodynamic 
stabilization initially.  However, patient developed worsening 
renal failure in the setting of her concurrent liver failure, 
consistent with HRS.  Renal function worsened with albumin 
infusions.  Renal was consulted and because of her poor 
prognosis and unlikely irreversible liver and renal function, 
dialysis was not an option.

#New onset Seizures: Head CT x 2 negative for bleed.  Likely 
secondary to either alcohol withdrawal, toxic-metabolic, or 
meningitis.  Her bleeding and hemodynamic issues precluded 
neuro's initial recommendations of MRI/MRA and LP.  24 hour EEG 
showed focal slowing left side but no seizure concerning for 
structural abnormality.  She was initially treated for 
meningitis as above, but therapy de-escalated when clinically 
appeared unlikely.  MRI/MRA obtained which were overall 
unremarkable for cause of seizure.  She was treated with keppra 
1000 mg BID per neuro recommendations. 

# MSSA PNA/VAP: Sputum sample obtained which grew coag pos 
staph.  She was treated with cefepime for an 8 day course.

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY 
Ms. ___ has a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma treated in ___
with mantle radiation and splenectomy, she was admitted ___
for a TAVR and during that admission was found to have a right
sided breast mass with pathology showing grade 2 invasive ductal
carcinoma ER/PR+, HER2-, with a positive FNA of an axillary node
and concern on imaging for metastatic disease to the
sternum/manubrium. She had noticed a breast mass in the right
breast detected on self exam for about 6 months. CT torso ___
showed a 4.2cm irregularly marginated medial right breast mass
which was highly suspicious for a breast cancer arising within a
radiation port, with additional smaller lesions superior
laterally in the right breast as well as right-sided skin
thickening and diffuse lucencies throughout the sternum, and
diffuse pulmonary nodules concerning for metastatic disease.
Mammogram ___ showed the 4 cm right breast mass, highly
suspicious for invasive carcinoma with invasion into the
skin and pectoralis muscle, two other right breast masses 1 of
which may represent an abnormal lymph node, and abnormal 
axillary
lymph nodes. She had an ultrasound guided breast core needle
biopsy ___ which showed ER/PR+ HER-2 negative invasive 
ductal
carcinoma, grade II, measuring 15mm in the limited sample. She
also had an FNA of an axillary LN that showed metastatic 
disease.
___ she had a bone scan which showed increased radiotracer
uptake within the manubrium and sternum. Her imaging including 
CT
and bone scan were reviewed and thought to be consistent with an
osseous metastatic disease process, and her pulmonary nodules
were also concerning for metastatic disease. There was no 
mention
of
pulmonary nodules on a previous CTA at ___ ___ which had 
diagnosed her with a PE. Bone biopsy of the sternum was 
performed
___, this returned positive.

IMAGING
=====================
CXR ___ IMPRESSION: 
Persistent moderate right pleural effusion with overlying 
atelectasis, cannot exclude underlying consolidation at the 
right lung base. Previously noted pulmonary edema appears 
somewhat improved. Previously seen small right-sided 
pneumothorax was better appreciated on CT.

CT Chest w/ contrast ___
Status post right lumpectomy with stable appearance of soft 
tissue mass along
the medial aspect of the right breast with overlying skin 
thickening.  Oval
small right axillary lymph nodes.
 
No change in the bilateral pleural effusions the right appears 
to be partially
loculated.  A right-sided pleural catheter is in place.
 
Diffuse septal thickening with the nodular opacities in the 
right lower lobe
and right middle lobe concerning for lymphangitic carcinomatosis 
unchanged.
 
Multiple bilateral pulmonary metastasis unchanged.
 
Stable osseous metastasis.
 
Evidence of paramediastinal radiation fibrosis.
 
Left-sided Port-A-Cath with its tip in the SVC.
 
Multiple liver lesions.  Please refer to dedicated report on 
abdomen which has
been dictated separatel

CT Abd and Pelvis w/ contrast
1. Multiple hepatic and abdominopelvic osseous metastases are 
unchanged in
comparison to the ___ examination.
2. No new abdominopelvic metastasis or lymphadenopathy.
3. Please refer to the separate chest CT dictation regarding 
intrathoracic
findings.

Pleural fluid ___
DIAGNOSIS:
PLEURAL FLUID, LATERALITY NOT SPECIFIED:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Upper Extremity US ___
The left subclavian vein inferior to the clavicle cannot be 
evaluated due to
bandaging.  There is no evidence of thrombosis in the 
supraclavicular portion
of the left subclavian vein.  Otherwise, no evidence of deep 
vein thrombosis
in the left upper extremity.

CXR ___
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with subjacent 
atelectasis
and/or consolidation as well as mild but unchanged pulmonary 
edema.

CT Chest w/ contrast ___. Compared to 2 weeks prior, scattered ground-glass opacities 
most prominent
in the paramediastinal parenchyma and lower lobes has improved, 
probably
improved edema.
2. Heterogeneous right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged since 
at least
___, probably chronic collapse, though superimposed 
infection cannot
be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
3. Scattered metastatic pulmonary nodules are unchanged.  
Somewhat nodular
interlobular septal thickening persists at the right lung base, 
concerning for
lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
4. A small left pleural effusion is slightly decreased.  A 
loculated right
pleural effusion with associated pleural enhancement concerning 
for malignant
pleural involvement is unchanged.
5. Hepatic lesions have significantly increased in size since 2 
weeks prior.
6. Right breast and axillary soft tissue are unchanged.  
Scattered osseous
metastases are unchanged.
7. A 2 cm enhancing right thyroid nodule is unchanged.  If/when 
clinically
indicated, this could be further assessed with ultrasound.

___ Upper GI swallow:
Study is markedly limited by patient's inability to assume 
procedural 
positions needed for adequate image acquisition and patient's 
inability to 
drink thin barium. 
Within the limitations of this study, there was free passage of 
contrast from 
oropharynx, through the esophagus, into the stomach.  However 
there was 
contrast pooling within the distal stomach without visualization 
of contrast 
passage into the duodenum. 

___ CXR:
Right-sided pleural effusion, similar to the prior radiographs.  
The tip of 
the enteric catheter does not lie within the majority of the 
fluid, as seen on 
recent CT. 

___ CXR:
Mild interstitial edema has developed since ___. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is still engorged, moderate right and 
small left 
pleural effusion stable, moderate enlargement of cardiac 
silhouette unchanged. 
No pneumothorax. 
  
Left central venous infusion port ends in the low SVC.  Right 
basal pleural 
drainage catheter unchanged in position.  T AVR noted. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=====================
___ year old woman with stage IV ER/PR+/HER2- breast cancer (on 
C1D12 of paclitaxel), malignant pleural effusion s/p R TPC (___), PE on rivaroxaban, dCHF, AS s/p TAVR, mitral stenosis 
presented with cough, dyspnea and diarrhea. She was found to 
have Cdiff infection and pneumonia, and was started on 
antiobiotic treatment. She was initially transferred to ICU due 
to low blood pressure and concern for sepsis. She was shortly 
kept on pressors, but upon communication with primary 
oncologist, it was found that her pressures normally run very 
low. Patient was transferred to the floor but then she quickly 
returned to the FICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. This 
was felt to be related to flash pulmonary edema. She was 
diuresed with IV Lasix 20mg and was started on BiPAP. She was 
weaned off BiPAP after diuresis and received further diuresis 
with improvement in respiratory status. BPs remained stable. She 
was continued on cefepime for treatment of HAP and was continued 
on po vancomycin for c. difficile colitis until ___ when she 
completed her course. On the floor she remained stable on ___ 
O2 requirements, which were weaned down to 0.5L with her 
diuresis which also were tapered to Lasix 40mg PO daily. Her 
blood pressures continued to fluctuate into low realms, however, 
improved in inverse reflection of her diuretic taper to levels 
where she able to undergo extensive in house ___ and become 
re-conditioned physically.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
#Sespis: Patient presented with tachypnea to 33, leukocytosis, 
and potential respiratory vs. abdominal source given symptoms. 
She was given 3L IVF in ED. She was started on treatment for HAP 
with vancomycin and cefepime. Was also found to be positive for 
C. diff, and was started on PO vancomycin in the ICU. Blood 
pressure initially required support with levophed which was 
weaned off in ICU within 1 day of admission after contact with 
primary oncologist confirmed that her baseline BPs run in the 
mid ___. Patient was subsequently transferred to medical floor, 
however returned quickly to ___ due to hypoxemic respiratory 
failure (see below).

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Malignant pleural effusion: 
Causes for her acute worsening dyspnea and hypoxia on the floor 
was believed to be flash pulmonary edema. Possible triggers 
included HTN (SBP 158 - baseline 80-90s), decompensated HF (BNP 
900s from 400s), tachycardia (120s from baseline 100s), 
worsening pleural effusion (150 cc drained ___, Trop and EKG 
without evidence of ischemia. She has stabilized with 20 mg IV 
Lasix, duoneb and BiPAP, transferred back to the floor. Pleurx 
was also frequently drained which helped improved hypoxia. 
Diuresis was continued on the floor however patient continued to 
have blood pressures on low ___, prompting taper of diuresis to 
40mg Lasix PO daily which reflected improvement in her BP, 
albeit it lingers below average. Pleurx was capped with plan for 
patient to continue two to three-times-per-week drainage on 
M(W)F and remove fluid as needed for comfort.

#Orthostatic hypotension: Likely related to volume status in the 
setting of ongoing diuresis, with possible contribution from 
olanzapine medication side effect. Improved w/ further ___ 
conditioning. Continued PO Lasix 40 daily, decreased from BID 
and TID earlier this admission. Continued ___ rehabilitation 
during admission and cleared for home. Continued olanzapine at 
decreased dose of 5mg qHS.

#Nausea/Vomiting: Attempted various permutations of medications 
but ultimately succeeded with suppression via pre-meal 
medication with Reglan, increased to appropriate dose. Continued 
on Caphosol for dry mouth, olanzapine 5mg QHS, Zofran PRN 
breakthrough (avoided standing as pt has developed tachyphylaxis 
in the past), and EKG q3d for QTc monitoring which have been 
unremarkable.

#Hospital acquired pneumonia: Presented with dyspnea, cough, 
presence of effusion and ?opacity on admission which was 
concerning for pneumonia. Initiated on vanc/cefepime on ___ 
for presumed HAP given recent hospitalization. Completed 
cefepime (___). Received vancomycin briefly (___) 
until MRSA swab was found to be negative. Cough was managed with 
Sodium Chloride 3% Inhalation Soln 15 mL NEB Q6H.

#HFpEF
#Mitral stenosis: likely due to mitral annular calcification 
with intermittent pulmonary edema during chemotherapy. Last ECHO 
on ___ demonstrated LVEF >55%, severe functional mitral 
stenosis, well seated aortic valve prosthesis. Notably, her 
tumor has shown signs of progression in her liver and lungs 
despite chemotherapy with 5 agents. Per Dr ___ (___) 
the risks of TMVR given her progressive metastatic disease are 
very high. Upon discharge, the patient will follow-up with Dr 
___ scheduling of a cardiac CT to reassess her risks and 
potential TMVR intervention. Lasix was 40mg PO daily at 
discharge, with discharge weight of 43.59kg 96.1lbs 

#Metastatic Breast Cancer: Patient originally on C1 of 
Paclitaxel, after failing multiple chemo regimens. Found to have 
metastatic pulmonary nodules and lymphangitic spread likely 
contributing to her hypoxia. Patient's further chemotherapy 
regimen was determined by her outpatient oncologist and fellow 
in-house given her length-of-stay and was started on eribulin in 
house ___, and second dose ___. Her CBC w/ diff has 
been followed during this therapy. Discontinued superfluous 
medications as ASA, atorvastatin, and decreased 
hydroxychloroquine to 200mg daily given weight changes. She will 
have follow up in outpatient ___ clinic for continuation of 
treatment. 

#C. Diff colitis: Patient presented with hypotension with 
initial possible sources including PNA was later found to have 
c. diff colitis. Patient was able to be weaned off of pressors 
after discovery that her baseline blood pressures are in the 
___. Patient was initiated on PO Vancomycin which she continued 
until ___. Per oncology floor policy, remained on precautions 
following the conclusion of her treatment.

#Macrocytic anemia: Hgb ~10 from baseline ~11, possibly in 
setting of fluid resuscitation vs. recent chemotherapy. Anemia 
remained stable.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
================= 
#?COPD: Wheezing on presentation. Smoking history. Continued 
nebs prn 
#Prior DVT/PE ___: Continued rivaroxaban
#AS: s/p TAVR
#HLD: Continued ASA/Atorvastatin, discontinued on discharge as 
above. 
#Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___!

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED?
You were admitted because he were found to have weakness and 
hypotension by your ___.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?
You were initially started on antibiotics for a presumed 
infection.  You also received fluids in order to raise your 
blood pressure.  Your infectious workup showed that you have an 
infection with C. difficile, as well as a pneumonia.  For this 
you were started on oral vancomycin which you took until ___. For your pneumonia you completed a 7 day course with 
cefepime.
You were also found to have increased oxygen requirements due in 
part to increased fluid accumulation around your lung.  This 
fluid was drained through your Pleurx and this helped improved 
your oxygen requirements. 
You had a short course in the ICU for management of your oxygen 
requirements, where you received diuresis (to remove the fluid 
from your lungs) and a BiPAP machine (to improve your 
breathing). 
After your stay in the ICU, you were transferred to a regular 
oncology floor where you remained stable on ___ Oxygen, however 
your blood pressures continued to be low. Due to this reason we 
had to stop your water pills temporarily but then we restarted 
them again since your fluid status was difficult to control.
You were weaned down to a dose of one water pill per day to 
maximize treatment of your shortness of breath while allowing 
you to hold your blood pressure and work with physical therapy. 
You continued to work with physical therapy in the hospital 
until you were re-conditioned to be able to work with your 
family at home to get stronger.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AT HOME?
You need to continued taking your medications as prescribed and 
follow-up with the appointments scheduled for you.
 
You should have your pleurx drained ___ times a week (M(W)F). 
You can take out as much fluid as you can until you start 
feeling uncomfortable.

Thank you for allowing us be involved in your care, we wish you 
all the best!
