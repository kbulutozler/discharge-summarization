RAG for error analysis. for example, think of the sections of a discharge report or even better, sections of the summaries. basically split to sentences and then group them into classes of sections that they are referring to in the discharge report. 

there gotta be some common generic words regarding to each section. 

for example, the patient was admitted to the hospital for a chief complaint or an accident. -> the part in the summary where they talk about the reason they were admitted must be semantically similar to this sentence. 


	•	Sliding Window Approach: Use overlapping windows to capture contextual information across sections.
	•	Use learning rate schedulers like cosine decay with warm restarts to adjust the learning rate during training.
	•	Monitor validation loss to avoid overfitting.
	•	Sometimes, fewer epochs with more data shuffling can yield better generalization.
	•	Experiment with newer optimizers like Lion or Adafactor for potential improvements.
	•	Start training on shorter documents and gradually increase the length to help the model adapt. curriculum learning
	•	Train the model on related tasks (e.g., question answering) to improve generalization.
	•	Explore meta-learning approaches to make the model better at learning from limited data.
