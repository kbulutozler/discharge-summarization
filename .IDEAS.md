	•	Sliding Window Approach: Use overlapping windows to capture contextual information across sections.
	•	Use learning rate schedulers like cosine decay with warm restarts to adjust the learning rate during training.
	•	Monitor validation loss to avoid overfitting.
	•	Sometimes, fewer epochs with more data shuffling can yield better generalization.
	•	Experiment with newer optimizers like Lion or Adafactor for potential improvements.
	•	Start training on shorter documents and gradually increase the length to help the model adapt. curriculum learning
	•	Train the model on related tasks (e.g., question answering) to improve generalization.
	•	Explore meta-learning approaches to make the model better at learning from limited data.
